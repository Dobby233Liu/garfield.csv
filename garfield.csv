"- Dear Garfield, Help! I have cat hairs all over my home. What can I do to keep Fluffy from shedding?
- Simple.
- Give the little beggar a good coat of varnish.",ga781216
"- scratch scratch scratch scratch
- Uh-oh
- Just look what you've done to my chair!
- You should be more considerate of other people's property.
- Now I know it's natural for cats to sharpen their claws.
- Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and cats gotta claw, but do it outside, okay? Garfield?
-
- GARFIELD",ga781217
"- zzzzzz
- YAWN!
- What a heck of a way to wake up.",ga781218
"-
-
-
-
-
- I know cats are fast, but THAT'S ridiculous.",ga781219
"- JON! COME QUICK!
- Look! Garfield is actually playing with Odie! I know. It's cause I sprayed Odie with something.
- With what? Essence of lasagna.",ga781220
"- You know, maybe there's more to life than just eating and sleeping...maybe I should be more considerate of other people's feelings, nicer to Odie and more generous.
-
- Nah.",ga781221
"- Scratching posts, Balls of yarn and rubber mousies are okay.
- But when it comes to REALLY NEAT playthings...
- Give me a Christmas tree!",ga781222
"- What would you like for Christmas, Garfield? 100 slave dogs.
- I'll bet you'd like a nice, fluffy ball of yarn to play with.
- I think I'll put a piranha in his Christmas stocking.",ga781223
"-
- HO-HO-HO
- WHUMP!
- Let's see, gifts for Jon, Lyman and Odie.
- Hmmm
- Oh, yes, and Garfield.
- How could I ever forget Garfield...
- Only kid in the world to ask for 20 pounds of lasagna.",ga781224
"- This is my very first Christmas.
- I hope you have a loved one to spend today with because I do.
- It's you. Merry Christmas.",ga781225
"- Okay, Garfield. Go fetch!
- *",ga781226
"- Time to get up, Garfield. zzzz
- GRRRRR
- Now what do I do? zzzz",ga781227
"-
- PUSH
- CLONK! I'm not known for my compassion.",ga781228
"- I love Fridays.
- The end of a long work week, the beginning of a weekend filled with relaxation, TV sports and parties.
- Almost makes me wish I had a job.",ga781229
"- This year I resolve to be nicer to dogs.
-
- Maybe I'll cut down on lasagna instead.",ga781230
"- It's time to make a new year's resolution, Garfield.
- I resolve to lose weight and start exercising this year.
-
- What am I saying?
- I must be going waka-waka!
- I'm NOT going to diet! ... I'm NOT going to exercise!
- I'M FAT, I'M LAZY, AND I'M PROUD *OF* IT!
- Where's Garfield? He ate the buffet and went to bed.",ga781231
"- POW!
-",ga790101
"- What would you like for breakfast, Garfield? A cup of coffee, a danish and the newspaper.
- Have a warm bowl of milk.
- You people don't give us cats any credit!",ga790102
"- Do you know why I don't like warm milk?
- Try this...drink a bowl of warm milk.
- Then, never brush your teeth again.",ga790103
"- Why is it all us cats are stereotyped?
- ""All cats love milk, hate dogs, love mice"" etc., etc., etc.
- Sometimes I get so mad I could just kick my Gucci scaring post.",ga790104
"- Do you know why you need me, Garfield?
- I can sum it up in two words.
- Quality companionship. Body heat.",ga790105
"- We cats are very independent.
- We need nobody, no time no where, no way.
- Isn't that right, Pooky?",ga790106
"- What, ho?
- Oh, goody, a blueberry muffin.
- ZIPPPPP
-
- scratch scratch scratch
- KICK!
- CRASH!
- If pardon the expression, there's more than one way to skin a cat.",ga790107
"- Look what my mother made for you, Garfield.
- There, how's that? It's nice and warm.
- Disgusting, demeaning, itchy and abomination. But, nice and warm.",ga790108
"- Would you just look at this? Jon's making me wear a kitty sweater.
- People dress their pets up because it makes them look like little people. Well, I'm NOT a little person, I'm a CAT.
- For instance, I like a pinch of catnip in my morning cup of coffee.",ga790109
"- Here he comes. Say something nice.
- Lookin' good, Garfield.
- Sharp sweater, ol' buddy.
- Sad. Looks like a meatball in traction.",ga790110
"- I was feeling pretty punk about having to wear a sweater...
- Until I saw Odie's new outfit.",ga790111
"- Uh-oh, it's starting to rain.
- I'd better let Garfield in before he gets his new sweater wet.
- Too late.",ga790112
"- snicker snicker
- HARF! HARF! HARF!",ga790113
"- When you own a cat, its hairs get everywhere.
- Every time I eat, I find a cat hair in my food. Let me show you.
- I know it's here something.
-
-
- I CAN'T EAT 'TIL I FIND THAT HAIR!
- Silly me. I forgot to put it in there.",ga790114
"-
- Garfield, you shouldn't chase the mailman like that.
- Now what would you do with him if you actually caught him? I'd eat him.",ga790115
"- Garfield, you know cats can't drink...
- SLURP! ...coffee.
- Fill 'er up! Well, I'll be dipped.",ga790116
"-
-
- It's amazing how we've grown to understand each other.",ga790117
"- Look, Garfield. A mouse!
- EEEK!",ga790118
"- Bachelorhood is okay, I guess.
- But you just can't beat...
- someone waiting for you when you get home.",ga790119
"- BARK! BARK!
- ROWR! YAP! FFFT!
- And they say pets are therapeutic.",ga790120
"- scratch scratch scratch
- Uh-oh. FLEAS!
-
-
- Alcohol should do the trick.
- Much better.
- puff puff
-
- FOOMP
- There's something to be said for flea collars.",ga790121
"- Garfield, you sleep to much, you eat too much, and you watch too much television.
- What does Jon expect of me, anyway?
- I'm only human.",ga790122
"- Television can be habit forming.
- I've been watching it all day.
- Would you like me to turn the TV on, Garfield? That would be nice.",ga790123
"- We've gotta stop watching the all-night movies on television, Garfield.
- But, of course, last night was an exception.
- Who would possibly turn off the Ethen Barrymore film festival?",ga790124
"- BANG! BANG! EEEK!
- SMACK!
- Okay, okay. I'll change the channel. I don't like violence.",ga790125
"- I hate television.
- There are too many commercials, reruns and game shows.
- The eight hours I watched yesterday was terrible.",ga790126
"- Television is only so much mindless drivel...
- Glossy adventures, sex and violence.
- Ain't it great?",ga790127
"- YAWN!
- smack smack smack
- Oh my.
- Just look at that gorgeous sunrise!
- Mother nature certainly uses every color on her vast palette to paint a dawn. Truly blessed are we, the early risers.
- Have you ever seen a more beautiful sunset, Garfield?
- Hmmm...I must have overslept.",ga790128
"- Garfield, you are disgustingly, slovenly, sloppy fat.
- Poor Jon.
- He obviously has disgustingly, slovenly, sloppy fat confused with ""big-boned"".",ga790129
"- Brenda, meet Garfield. Hi, Garfield.
- Is Garfield a pig? He's a cat.
- Oh, that REALLY hurts.",ga790130
"- ahhh
- CRASH!
- Face it, Garfield. Windowsills just aren't built for us queen-sized felines.",ga790131
"- If you take one bite of my pie, Garfield, I'll smack your fat little paws.
-
- If I can't have it, neither can he.",ga790201
"- I'll bet you can't wait to see what kind of cat food you're having for dinner. I'll bet I can.
- Here it comes... You can cut the tension with a knife.
- LIVER! Oh, hooray, hop about, clap paws, squeal with glee.",ga790202
"- Now I wouldn't say you're fat, Garfield...
- But when you sit around the sofa, you SIT AROUND the sofa.
- KICK! Heads, he lives. Tails, he dies.",ga790203
"-

- Let's see...iodine, band-aids, gauze, bullwhip, small straight-jacket, helmet, pan, shampoo, gloves, rinse, conditioner, blow dryer, brass knuckles, towel, rope, elbow pads...
- Garfield's bath day? Garfield's bath day.",ga790204
"- I think I'll do some jogging.
- Okay...GO, FEET!
- Hmmm, reckon the little suckers just weren't in the mood.",ga790205
"- Garfield, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't read over my shoulder
-
- READ over my shoulder?",ga790206
"- Stay away from my chicken leg, Garfield. Aw, stuff it in your ear. mrow fft!
- WHAT WAS THAT?!
- Oh.",ga790207
"- Gee...I wonder which shirt goes better with my slacks.
- Lyman, could you give me your opinion on something? Sure.
- What can I do for you? Forget it. Beau Brummell lives.",ga790208
"-
-
- He's trying to tell me to turn the heat up.",ga790209
"- Guess what, Garfield? Somewhere on me is a kittie munchie for you.
-
- Maybe that wasn't such a good idea. munch munch munch",ga790210
"- NAB!
- I'm going to give you a bath, Garfield. You and what army?
-
-
- Okay...I give up. You can go.
- SPLOOSH",ga790211
"- I hate cold floors in the morning.
- Nobody likes cold floors.
- But we cats have to put twice as many feet on them.",ga790212
"- Pets are great to have on cold nights.
- As long as you don't mind...
- The crowded conditions.",ga790213
"- BARK! YIP! ROWR! FFFT!
- GARFIELD! ODIE! Why don't you boys go outside to fight.
- While I lie here and quietly bleed to death.",ga790214
"- * * *
- GARFIELD! Get off the piano!
- Talk about stifling one's creative talents.",ga790215
"- There's one nice thing about being a cat at the dinner table.
-
- Everything you touch is yours.",ga790216
"- What's a six-letter word for ""pain,"" Garfield?
- ARRRGH!!!
- Is that with three or four r's?",ga790217
"- scrub scrub scrub scrub

- CLICK!
- GARFIELD! STOP!
- It's below freezing out there.",ga790218
"- You say you want me to eat this hamburger, Pooky?
- And this chicken? And this lasagna?
- You gotta go a long way to find a teddy bear as good as old Pooky here.",ga790219
"- SMACK!
- HEY YOU! Come back here and fight like a teddy bear!
- What am I saying?",ga790220
"- Be honest, Pooky. Do you think I'm getting a little pudgy around the middle?
-
- Not a lot of personality, but he certainly knows when to keep his mouth shut.",ga790221
"-
-
- A dancing bear? Next time, I get to lead.",ga790222
"- Let's go for a walk, little fella.
- SMACK!
- Well, I'll be. Pooky doesn't like dogs either.",ga790223
"- Okay, who knocked my fern off the windowsill?!

- His lying to me isn't half so upsetting as the credit he's giving my intelligence.",ga790224

- Some days I'm just not in the mood to be adored.",ga790227
"- Woould puppy tat wike a bowl of milk?
- Would funny wooking man wike a milk bath?
- Never be condescending to a cat.",ga790228
"-
- GARFIELD! Did you eat my chicken?
- No, of course not. If you had, there would be some bones left.",ga790301
"- Be careful around this clock, Garfield. It's an old family heirloom.
- CRASH!
- One small push for a cat, one giant leap for good taste.",ga790302
"- Where were you, Garfield? I called you an hour ago for dinner. Uh-oh.
- KLUNK!
- You've got to get to cat food before it sets up.",ga790303

- What a heck of a way to start the week.",ga790305
"- The darn toaster isn't working again. I guess I'll have to fix it.
- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- First, you have to get its attention.",ga790306
"- Breakfast is on, Garfield.
- Carry me.
- Sometimes I think I cater to Garfield too much.",ga790307
"-
- That's called disco dancing, Garfield. Thank heavens.
- For a minute there I thought he had a life carp in his jockey shorts.",ga790308
"- Garfield, that steely-eyed cowcat, roams into town.
- He mounts his faithful steed, Odie.
- All I need now is a sunset.",ga790309

- KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
- Nobody home.",ga790313
"-
- I suppose I should learn to like Odie.
- But I just can't respect anyone who turns around three times to lie down.",ga790314
"-
- Hmmm
- Just as I suspected. There's a tiny sign in there saying, ""Space For Rent"".",ga790315
"- BARK! BARK! BARK!
- That's good enough. SCREEE POOMP!
- Thanks for the exercise. PUNT!",ga790316
"-
- pat pat pat pat
- You didn't see that.",ga790317
"- Hmmm, Jon's drawing board. Hmmm, some paper. Hmmm, some ink.
- I think this world would be a nicer place in which to live: If countries could settle their differences without hurting anybody. If everyone smiled at even people they didn't know.
- If nobody had to steal. I people laughed more. If everyone fed their cats all the lasagna they could eat. If we all took more pride in our homes and our neighborhoods.
- If we respected our senior citizens more. If there were no violence in movies and television. If everyone could read and write. If families talked more.
- If friends hugged more. If everyone stopped at least once a weak to stroke a cat. After all, we're all in this together.
- Hey, Garfield.
- What's this? Oh, just some paw prints.",ga790318
"- I'm going to teach you to do some tricks this week, Garfield. Over my dead body.
- Sing for me, Garfield. MROWR!
- VERY GOOD! There was a bone in my tuna pate.",ga790319
"- Garfield, go fetch my pipe, paper and slippers. Yes, sir. Right away, sir...
- Where IS he?
- GARFIELD! Okay, okay. As soon as I'm done with the financial section.",ga790320
"- Roll over, Garfield. You gotta be kidding.
- If you roll over, I'll give you a double helping of lasagna.
- WHIRRRRRR!",ga790321
"- Speak, Garfield, speak.
- Why, of course, Jon. Is there any particular topic on which you'd like to converse?
- B-B-B-B-B",ga790322
"- Sit up and beg for the kitty munchy, Garfield.
- Tell you what. You give me the munchy and I'll let you keep your face.
- I knew that we could arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise.",ga790323
"- Dance for me, Garfield. Not a chance.
- If you won't, I'm sure Odie would be happy to.
- You have to know what motivates a cat. This is demeaning.",ga790324
"-

- Ho hum
-
- Ever had one of those days when you feel like you've slept and eaten it all?",ga790325
"- Ah, it's early morning for the caped avenger. Ring!
- The caped avenger who searches out evil wherever it may lurk.
- The late-morning evil, that is.",ga790326
"- The caped avenger sees food!
- In order to fight evil, the caped avenger needs food for strength.
- Lots and LOTS of strength!",ga790327
"- AHA! The caped avenger sees injustice. BONK!
-
- Beat it, brute. BOOT!",ga790328
"- The caped avenger sees a large evil person he must destroy in the name of good, because the caped avenger isn't a chicken.
-
- The caped avenger isn't stupid, either.",ga790329
"- The caped avenger will now fly down and destroy the evil mailman.
-
- SPLAT!
- I think the caped avenger is starting to believe his own press releases.",ga790330
"- The caped avenger will now step outside to fight evil.
-
- The caped avenger will now step inside and announce his retirement.",ga790331
"- I'm so bored.
- Hmmmm
- ptu! twing! YIP! SPLOOSH!
- BONK!
- KICK!
- Much better.",ga790401
"- Did you know most cats shed their winter coats in warm weather, Garfield?
- FUMP!
- Hmmm mus' be spring.",ga790402
"- Spring is here.
- The warm spring sun is coaxing trees to bud and flowers to bloom. Fledging songbirds are testing their lilting voices. Soft spring zephyrs are wafting the sweet scent of lilacs. Spring is here.
- Big, fat hairy deal.",ga790403
"- There's nothing like a little spring weather to make one feel lazy.
- I'd better be careful.
- If I were lazier, I could slip into a coma.",ga790404
"- I like spring.
- The grass is back from its dormancy. The flowers are back from a long winter's rest.
- And the birds are back from Miami.",ga790405
"- I just love to lie out in this warm spring sun.
- Uh-oh.
- I think I just melted.",ga790406
"- Ah, spring. In the spring a young man's fancy turns lightly to thoughts of love.

- And the street department puts a fresh coat of rust-resistant paint on the fire hydrants.",ga790407

"- Move it, Garfield, I'm going to watch television.

"- Boy, am I in a bad mood. *Good Morning, Garfield*
- POKE!
- If there's anything a depressed person hates, it's a cheerful person.",ga790410
"- Garfield's sure been in a nasty mood lately. We'll see about that. Do you know how to treat a mad cat?
-
- With great, great respect.",ga790411
"-
- ROWR! FFFT!
- I think I hurt myself.",ga790412
"- I know you've been in a nasty mood this week, Garfield. Many of us occasionally feel angry for no reason at all...psychologists all it a free-floating anxiety.
- SPLAT! FREE-FLOAT THIS!
- I wonder if this ever happened to Freud.",ga790413
"- Easy, boys.
- WE LOVE YOU, GARFIELD!

- SWIPE!
- Or maybe some coleslaw. Now you're talking.",ga790417

- SLAM!
- And I'd completely forgotten about the pain.",ga790424

- They allow us cats to walk right up trees.
- There's only one problem.",ga790426
"-
- POP
- They don't call me ""Lightning Lips"" for nothing.",ga790427
"- I just want you people to know how much we cats appreciate you. Without you, who would feed us? Who would love us?
- And most important of all...
- Who would change our kitty litter?",ga790428
"- GROWL
- The cat craves fresh meat.
- What-ho, the cat senses unsuspecting quarry o'er yon knoll.
- Coiling like a spring, he prepares to lunge.
- Steely sinews propel him toward his helpless prey.
- Once again a cat's primal instincts provide sustenance.",ga790429
"- Boy, I', starved. I think I'll have sausage. hash browns and some eggs over easy.
- Good morning, Garfield. Here's tuna and liver surprise!
- The sausage and hash browns are delicious. But I do believe the eggs are a bit overdone.",ga790430
"- GASP! CHOKE! BRACK! COUGH! HACK!
- FLOP!
- Can the melodramatics, Garfield, and finish your liver.",ga790501
"- BURP!
- That was rude and crude, Garfield. Cats are more sophisticated than to submit to belching at the dinner table.
- BRAACK!",ga790502
"- Tell me what you think of my new poem, Garfield.
- ""MY BUDDY"" I have a buddy. My buddy's a toad. He's kind of muddy, he's flat on the road. But, he is my buddy, my buddy to stay, 'til he's peeled up and sailed away.
- Garfield?",ga790503

"- Hello, Julie? How about a movie tonight? Oh, I see. Okay, goodbye.
- Darn, she said she was just walking out the door to visit her brother in Tokyo.
- That's what I call bad timing.
- That's called getting shot out of the saddle, you turkey.",ga790511
"- Garfield, you're getting too fat.
- I am NOT getting too fat.
- I'm just ready for the next size kitty bed, that's all.",ga790512

"- It was bound to happen. My stomach finally outgrew my legs.
- Worse things could happen, I guess.
- Like this, for instance.",ga790515
"- Well, you've finally done it, Garfield. Your belly's bigger than your legs. Now what are you going to do?
- I'll show you what I'm going to do.
- If you'll just roll me over to that lasagna there.",ga790516
"- You're going to have to exercise that belly off, Garfield.
- Tell you what. I'll get a leash and take you for a brisk morning drag.

"- Hellooo, doc. Remember me? Where's your cat?
- Forget my cat. Can't we get started without him? Sure.
- First a vitamin E shot to give your coat a keener sheen. I'll get my cat.",ga810318
"- How a bout a date, my little kitten?
- I don't date men who who use animal names out of context.
- Rats.",ga810319
"- Why don't you like me?
- You're wishy-washy, crude, and a twerp.
- I mean aside from that.",ga810320
"- Your cat is extremely overweight, Mr. Arbuckle. It could lead to serious heart problems. Not to worry.
- I don't think Garfield has a heart.
- See?!",ga810321
"-
- I'm going to jog this morning.
- Of course, it will be cold when I start.
- But then I'll get hot and sweaty.
- And my heart will pound, making me dizzy.
- I'll get blisters on my feet.
- Then I'll be stiff and sore for days.
- Jogging probably wouldn't be so bad. But the anticipation is killing me.",ga810322
"- I wonder what today is?
- BONK!
- Monday.",ga810323
"- There are two of us and only one donut, Garfield. Let's share it.
-
- Where's my share? Look closely. I left the hole for you.",ga810324
"- bark! bark! bark!
-
- I fail to see the sport in it.",ga810325
"- Ah, a screen door upon which to hang.
-
- They don't make'm like they used to.",ga810326
"- Hello. What's this?
- Don't panic, Garfield. It's only a little rain.
- AAAAAAAAAAAAA",ga810327
"- I love lasagna fresh from the oven: the tomato sauce, the meat, the melted cheese.
-
- GARFIELD!",ga810328
"- I', going out, Garfield. The women will be hysterical over me. The outfit's hysterical.
- What do you think about my attire? It could use some alteration.
- Let's tuck that tie in and add some vents to the sleeves.
-
- A smart cat knows just how far to go without crossing over the line.
- Perhaps a more rakish tilt to the hat.",ga810329
"- Just remember, Garfield, when we get to the farm you are there to relax.
- I know last time you wanted to be helpful...
- But you do not grow chickens by planting chickens in the ground! It was an hones mistake.",ga810330
"- Mothers equate love with food. When they feed you they're saying, ""I love you"".
- Eat, eat, eat.
- And I love you, too.",ga810331
"- The light bulb's burned out.
- Don't worry about me, I'll just sit here in the dark going blind.
- I'll fix it. He's such a good boy.",ga810401
"- When I was your age I was married and had a kid. Yeh, me!
-
- Good argument, son. But I still think you should get married.",ga810402
"- Now that the sun has set, we come to the exciting part.
- We turn around to watch the moon rise.
- Be still my beating heart.",ga810403
"- It IS kind of pretty out here on the farm.
- chirp chirp
- Walt Disney, eat your heart out.",ga810404
"-
- Uh oh. I'll never make it across that sunbeam awake.
- Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
- Z poomp!
- Come on , Garfield, let's go for a walk. Z
- Z Z",ga810405
"- You're getting a little pudgy there, Garfield.
- Maybe you'd be more attractive to the ladies if you'd suck your gut in.
- And then again, maybe not.",ga810406
"- Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me.
- Buenos dias, mon sweet. I knew you'd come back to me.
- Of course you did, fatso. You're sitting on my rubber mouse.",ga810407
"- Tell me, Arlene, how does it feel to have a huge, ugly, disgusting gap between your front teeth?
- BAP!
- Oh.",ga810408
"- ROWR OOOO
- Why do cats always caterwaul when they date? Would you rather come to my place and see my cat show trophy?
- EROOO",ga810409
"- How about us having a lasting relationship, Garfield?
- I'm sorry, Arlene. I'm already hopelessly in love with somebody else.
- Who? Me.",ga810410
"- Thanks for the date, Arlene. How about a good night kiss?
- kiss kiss smack kiss
- Masher.",ga810411
"-
- Aren't pet stores fascinating, Garfield?
- The cute hamsters, the canaries, the tropical fish.
- Garfield?
- GARFIELD?!!
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, let's go home for lunch. No thanks, I just ate.",ga810412
"- Where were you last night, Garfield?
-
- You met a ballet dancer and went to a sack race? Close enough.",ga810413
"- Z
- BARK!",ga810414
"- yip! yip! YIP! YIP!
-",ga810415
"- If there is such a thing as reincarnation, I'd like to come back as a movie star.
- What would you like to come back as, Garfield? What a silly question.
- A dogcatcher, of course.",ga810416
"- Mornin', Jon. What'll you have? Ham'n'eggs, eggs over easy.
- And what'll you have, sir?
- One of each will do nicely, thank you.",ga810417
"- Garfield. Cats can't walk on their hind feet.
- I didn't know that.",ga810418
"- dial dial
- Hello, Ingrid? How about a date this weekend?
- Okay...then how about next weekend? How about the weekend after that?
- Maybe the weekend after that? Or the weekend after that? The next one? How about the weekend after that?
- Look Ingrid, if you don't want to go out with me, why don't you just say so!
- SLAM!
- I guess I told her. String 'em along then break their hearts. Right, Jon?",ga810419
"- The moon is right.
- The time is right.
- Good evening, ladies and germs. A funny thing happened on the way here tonight...",ga810420
"- A canary walks up to me the other day and he says, ""I haven't had a bite in three days."" So you know what I did?
- I ate him!
- Yah dah dah dah dah dah tappity tappity tappity",ga810421
"- O solo MEYOW

"- BRING!
- Good morning, Garfield. Here's your yummy breakfast.
- SPLAT! Yuk.
- scratch RIP! scratch
- Chirp chirp
- EEEEEK!
- Just another day in the life of a typical cat.",ga810426
"- Why were cats placed upon this earth?
- Why, to give people pleasure.
- And to give dogs a hard way to go. SMACK!",ga810427
"- There's nothing like a steaming cup of coffee and a newspaper to get the day started.
-
- I'd enjoy it even more if I could read.",ga810428
"- ROWR
-",ga810429
"- Once again I venture into the wilderness in search of quarry.
- I spot my prey, but I must make a clean kill.
- Hamburgers can be vicious if they're only wounded.",ga810430
"- I eat too much, I sleep too much and I don't exercise at all.
- There's certainly room for improvement.
- I think I'll take up smoking.",ga810501

- Ha ha. How can I resist you when you're cute? Help yourself, Garfield.
- A fool and his lasagna are soon parted.",ga810505
"-
-",ga810506
"- How do you feel about jogging this morning, Garfield?
- How do you feel about bleeding this morning.
- I get your drift. Bright lad.",ga810507
"- If you want to eat, use this can opener, Garfield.
- You know what to do with it. Yes, I do.
- Gimme a steak.",ga810508
"-
- Okay, who put eyeballs on my hamburger?",ga810509
"-
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, GARFIELD?!
- You were walking down the street minding your own business...
- SNIFF You stopped to smell a flower...
- When a big dog slipped up behind you...
- CLOBBER
- And beat the stuffing out of you. You are so right.",ga810510
"- Hey, Garfield, what do you think of my new wallpaper?
-
- I like it.",ga810511
"- If I were the cruel sort, I'd shove Odie off the table.
- But I'm not.
- Teddy bears, on the other hand... BOMP!",ga810512
"- GET OUT OF MY CHAIR. OUT! OUT!
- Pooky wants to watch television . I guess I know where I fall in the order of things.",ga810513
"- I have a new diet for you, Garfield. You can eat all you want.
- After eating five pounds of carrots!",ga810514
"- Garfield, you hang around the house too much.
- What can I do to interest you in the great outdoors?
- You can screen it in and out a roof over it, for starters.",ga810515
"-
- NAP ATTACK!
- I hate him. Z",ga810516
"- I wonder if I could stand on just two feet?
- Hey, this is great! I'm standing!
- Now I can tap-dance. tap tap tap tappity tap tap
- And I can reach the tabletop.
- And drop-kick Odie. DROP KICK!
- Garfield! Cats can't walk on their HIND FEET!
- SMACK! See? Thanks a lot.",ga810517
"- Would you like to go camping, Garfield?

- We'll have pan-baked lasagna. I'm packed. Let's go.",ga810518
"- Everything's packed for the camping trip, Garfield. Did I forget anything?
-
- Anything else? Yes, 250 miles of extension cord.",ga810519
"-
- There's only one thing I like about cars.
- The upholstered ceilings.",ga810520
"-
- Garfield! Get out of there!
- The light DOES turn off when the glove compartment is closed.",ga810521
"- boing boing
- Are you bored, Garfield?
- We'll find out how bored I am if I don't get to a litter box soon.",ga810522
"- Get out of the car, Garfield.
- Let us bask in the sun and sleep with nature's creatures, Garfield.
- Translation: ""Let's bake our brains and lie on the ground with bugs and snakes, Garfield"".",ga810523
"- Well, here we are in the wilds, Garfield. Keep a sharp eye out for wild animals.
- WHAT?!
- WHA...?!
- You're just fooling me, aren't you?
-
- Oh, no, you don't, Garfield.
- I'll wise up to your tricks if it's the last thing I do.",ga810524
"- Come on across the creek, Garfield.
- I don't know why you cats are so afraid of a little mud.
- You would be too if you had to wash yourself with your tongue.",ga810525
"- Welcome to our first night of camping, Garfield. enjoy.
- ROAR!
- You enjoy. I'll be waiting in the car.",ga810526
"- Lock your door, Garfield. This is a tough neighborhood.
- I know.
- How often do you see kids having a fire hydrant eating contest?",ga810527
"-
-",ga810528
"-
-
- Tell me that's not a traffic cop's hat you're wearing, Garfield. Okay, it's not a traffic cop's hat.",ga810529
"- I'm bored. I think I'll step out for some fresh air.
- GARFIELD! WE ARE GOING OVER 50!
- So I noticed.",ga810530
"-
- Well, well, Here comes Arlene.
- Hey, baby, what's happenin'? Buzz off, creep.
- How about a gourmet dinner? I'm all yours!
-
- You really shouldn't have. Hang the expense. Only the best garbage for you, my dear.",ga810531
"- You again. Me again.
- Nermal, the world's cutest kitten.
- Now, stand aside, fatso. I have people to charm.",ga810601
"- Out!
- You can scratch my chair, you can insult my mother, you can beat up my dog, and you can play with my rubber mousie...
- But you don't eat my food and you don't sleep into my bed. Yes, sir.",ga810602
"- We cats are very independent.
- We don't need attention.
- Unless it's being given to someone else.",ga810603
"- Come here, Nermal.
- Make yourself useful.
- Where are you going? Trolling for dogs.",ga810604
"-
- MINE!

- CRASH!
- I love you when you're naughty.",ga810614

- SPOING!",ga810615
"- Claire, baby! What say you and I go out tonight and paint the town red, sweets?
- Yeh, maybe another time?
- Now who should I call? Try Clods Anonymous.",ga810616
"- Hellooo, Mary. Say, good lookin', where have you been all my life?
- I see...you lived on Main Street until you were two, then you moved to Rosewood where you presently reside.
- Shall I ask her out, Garfield? Sounds like a match made in heaven.",ga810617
"- Hanging on the screen door was more dangerous in olden times when people threw their dishwater out.
- GOOSH
- Old habits die hard.",ga810618
"- I can hear them sneaking up behind me now.
- They are crouching, getting ready to leap.
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GARFIELD! What a wonderful surprise!",ga810619
"-
-
- GARFIELD! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SPEAK TO ME! I'm not speaking to you.",ga810620
"-
- I'm bored.
- Bored, bored bored.
- There must be more things to do on a screen door than just hang there.
-
-
-
- Nice going, dummy.",ga810621
"- There you are, Garfield. A genuine Naugahyde leash.
- How inhumane! How cruel!
- Do you know how many naugas they killed to make this leash?",ga810622
"-
- ROWRR!!
- hop hop",ga810623
"- Where are you going, Jon? I'm breaking Garfield to the leash.
- He doesn't like it much, does he? How can you tell?",ga810624
"-
-",ga810625
"- You wait here while I go into the store.
- Leashes are the greatest things since sliced bread.
- By the way, don't forget the frozen lasagna.",ga810626
"- You know, Garfield, I've come to realize leashes aren't right for cats.
- Now there's a news flash for you.
- Next he will come to realize icebergs weren't right for the Titanic.",ga810627
"- Sit up.
- Roll over, Odie.
- Speak. Urf.
- Play dead.
- Beg.
- WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE?!",ga810628

"-
- WAHCHOO!
- SNIFF",ga810701
"- Dear Garfield, How do I avoid the embarrassment of cat hair all over my house when I have company? Harried.
- Simple.
- Never invite anyone to your home again.",ga810702
"- I love sunny windowsills.
-
- And I hate open windows.",ga810703
"-
-
- Stay away from rocking chairs. Sound advice.",ga810704
"-
-
-
- Oh yuk!
- What did you drag that fish in for?
- SMACK! BONK!
- When a cat presents you with a dead, smelly thing, it's an expression of love, you twit.",ga810705
"- Here's a lesson in the natural order of things.
- Cats use claws to climb up trees.
- And fire departments to get down.",ga810706
"- What does Garfield the cat do when he's stuck up a tree?
- Why what any honorable cat would do, of course.
- WAHHH!",ga810707
"- I'm getting out of this tree.
- BOING!
- I didn't allow for my resilient nature.",ga810708
"- Poor me..stuck up a tree.
- Things could be worse, I guess.",ga810709
"- Why do I always get stuck up trees?
- It must be the cat in me.
- Right on.",ga810710
"- Come here, cat. ROWR!
- ROWR FFT! Here you are, cat. kiss Thanks.",ga810711
"- Oh good, it's here.

- CHOMP!
- SPROING!
- ROWR! Hee hee.
- GRRRR HA! HA! HA!
-
- It was worth it.",ga810712
"-
-
- You could've asked me to pass the salt. Cats don't ask. Cats take.",ga810713
"- Just look at yourself, Garfield. You're becoming a soft, sugar dependent, grease-eating lard ball. Is that what you want?
- YES!
- Let me rephrase that...",ga810714
"- Some people say I'm fat.
- Big deal, I love to eat.
- Waddling and sweating is kind of fun too.",ga810715
"-
- BASH!
- Good morning, fatso. All I did was jump off the bed.",ga810716
"- It isn't healthy for a cat to be as big as you are, Garfield.
- Why, you could get heart disease, get fallen arches...
- Get harpooned. Couldn't resist it could you.",ga810717
"-
- CRASH
- Maybe I should go on diet.",ga810718
"- Let me give you a driving session, Garfield.
- When you're as good a driver as I am, you drive defensively.
- You look both ways at an intersection.
- Then you proceed with caution.
- HONK! SCREEEE!
- Darn you, Garfield. I'm such a kidder.",ga810719
"- I think you're eating too much salt, Garfield. I'm going to take it out of your diet.
- If you must.
- But I'm sure going to miss my salt lick.",ga810720
"- I'm putting you on a diet, Garfield. OH NO!
- I may have to resort to desperate emergency measures.
- Like chasing mice.",ga810721
"- I'm going to start you on your diet slowly, Garfield.
- For the rest of the week you may have no desserts. Fine and dandy.
- Helloooo, main course.",ga810722
"- Hello, ice cream. Hello, hamburger. Hello, lasagna.
- Get away from the refrigerator, Garfield. You're on a diet.
- What were you doing? Just visiting some old friends.",ga810723
"- I'm on a diet again. What a bummer.
- Soon there will be less of me around.
- I'm going to miss me.",ga810724
"-
-
- The lost-your-will-to-live phase of the diet, huh? Let me die in peace.",ga810725
"-
-
-
-
-
-
- Going to do some singing on the ol' fence tonight? Music is my life.",ga810726
"- Hello. What's this?
-
- I hate mondays.",ga810727
"- Garfield, Garfield, Garfield. You ate my fern. I'm a bad boy.
- Now I'll have to go buy another one.
- I hope it tastes better than this one.",ga810728
"-
-
- MMMPH",ga810729
"- Good morning, Garfield.
- Don't speak to me just yet.
- Some people have no respect for slow risers.",ga810730
"-
-
- In the flower garden again, Garfield? How'd you guess?",ga810731
"- Do you know what this country needs? More dog pounds.
- Anti-dog mines around fire hydrants! Dog hunting season! Dog traps!
- Relax, Garfield. You're going to burst something. Why, millions could be saved on carpet cleaning bills alone.",ga810801
"- *
- Garfield, lasagna!
-
-
- I waxed the table today. When my bones knit, you are a dead man.",ga810802
"-
-
- You know it's Monday when you find sharks circling in your water bowl.",ga810803
"- I'm in the mood for a good fight, but I am personally opposed to senseless violence.
- PUNT!
- That's for not being a cat.",ga810804
"- Hey look, Garfield. This is my impression of a bowling ball.
- SHOOP!
- That was my impression of a vacuum cleaner.",ga810805
"- I feel like getting into a big fight today.
-
- Now I feel like holing up somewhere to whimper for a while.",ga810806
"- What do you want to do tonight, Garfield? Do you want to go jogging? Go to a movie? Play miniature golf.
- Or would you rather go eat?
- Natch.",ga810807
"- Do you take your cat everywhere?
- Yes, we do everything together, my dear.
- Except make passes at ugly waitresses.",ga810808
"- Here it comes, folks.
- Tah-dah!
-
- Lasagna anyone? I'll pass. Nope. I'm on a diet. I think I'll wait for dessert. I just ate.",ga810809
"- I wonder where I should go on vacation.
- Maybe France or Spain...
- Or Mexico.",ga810810
"- Garfield, I've decided to take a vacation. Great! When do we leave?
- I don't think you understand. I said ""I"", not ""we"".
- Say you're just kidding. I think you understand.",ga810811
"- I can't believe Jon's not taking me on vacation.
- Cats need vacations too.
- All this eating and sleeping can wear a guy down.",ga810812
"- Aunt Gussie, would you take care of my cat while I'm gone on vacation? ...terrific!
- You know aunt Gussie, Garfield. She's a sweet old lady.
- How can you say that about someone who used to double date with Lizzie Borden?",ga810813
"- Garfield, meet aunt Gussie.
- I'm tickled pink to meet you.
- And you can color me unimpressed.",ga810814
"- While I'm gone take good care of Garfield.
- And keep a close eye on him. He gets a lot of mischief.
- Have fun, Garfield. Garfield?",ga810815
"-
- pat pat pat
-
- POOMP!
- I would have had to eat him to save face.",ga810816
"- Stowing away in Jon's suitcase is thirsty work.
- GLUCK GLUCK GLUCK
- Even after shave lotion tastes good if you're dry enough.",ga810817
"- Look out, sunny beaches.
- Here comes Don Juan.
- And his sidekick, Lawrence of Boxer Shorts.",ga810818
"- I can't believe you stowed away in my suitcase, Garfield.
- I'll bet you don't even know where we are.
- A tourist trap would be a safe assumption.",ga810819
"- That's the trouble with vacation spots.
- This hamburger is terrible!
- What do you expect for a lousy $23,50?",ga810820
"- This is the life, Garfield.
- You know you're on vacation when you see women in bikinis, hibiscus blossoms in the pool...
- And la cucarachas in the sock drawer.",ga810821
"- Pardon me...I believe I dropped my nobel peace prize around here somewhere. Beat it, crap.
-",ga810822
"- Hey, Garfield, guess what?
- The dog next door is being given a birthday party today.
- This brick should make a spiffy gift.
-
- BONK! YIP!
- YIP! Happy birthday, dog.
-
- Hello, doctor? Do you think you could surgically remove my cat from a dog?",ga810823
"- Hey, Garfield. It says here they are holding auditions for a cat food commercial.
- Would you be interested?
- Have my agent give the script a look-see.",ga810824
"- To win the cat food commercial audition you'll have to be a convincing eater.
- Can you handle that? Are you kidding?
- When it comes to eating, I'm a genius.",ga810825
"- Imagine me doing a cat food commercial.
- Next there'll be the movie offers, the screaming fans, the limousines...
- Belly, you and I are going places.",ga810826
"- Is this where my cat auditions for the cat food commercial? Yeh.
- Hey, Larry. Break out the wide-angle lens.
- If I don't get the part, the director is going to be sporting those shades up his right nostril.",ga810827
"- Okay, food commercial audition take one, action! That stuff looks awful.
- CUT!
- You're supposed to eat it, cat. What's my motivation`",ga810828
"- Okay, cat food commercial audition take two, action!
- Yuk!
- Mmph grp bruf What's the director saying, Garfield? Loosely translated, I don't fit the part.",ga810829
"-
- Good morning, Garfield.
-
-
- SLUP
- * Good morning *",ga810830
"- Well, if it isn't Nermal, the Shirley Temple of the feline set.
- How's it going, Nermal? Oh, about the same. I'm overadored as usual.",ga810831
"- Do you know why I hate Nermal?
- It's not because he's so young , tiny and cute...
- He reminds me I'm so old, fat and ugly.",ga810901
"-
- I can't reach that pie, Nermal. What say we team up?",ga810902
"- Maybe I could be as popular as Nermal if I learned to dance.
-
- I think I hurt something.",ga810903
"- MINE!
-
- Yours.",ga810904

- WAH! I'm beginning to worry about Garfield.",ga820909

- Here's an interesting article about the ancient practice of cannibalism. Lovely.
- Can you imagine what life was like then?
- Traveling salesmen were called ""meals on wheels"".
- Having the boss over for dinner had an entirely different meaning.

- Thanks for dusting under the bed for me, Garfield. I hate you.",ga830125
"-
- WHIRRR!
- nightie-night, Jon. I hate you.",ga830126
"- Surprise, Garfield! I brought you another rubber mouse. Yippee skip.
- By the way, what happened to your last one? It was tragic.
- He was caught and eaten by a rubber cat.",ga830127
"- Surprise, Garfield! I threw your old bed in the trash and got you this new one. What do you think?
-
- Z",ga830128
"- Dogs have the world's stupidest toys. Just look at this rubber bone.
- Simple minds, simple pleasures.
- It certainly doesn't hold the scintillating intellectual challenge of my fuzzy scratching post wit the springy rubber mouse.",ga830129
"- *
-
-
-
-
- ROWR! ARRRGH!
- THAT WASN'T FUNNY; GARFIELD! Funny is in the eye of the beholder.",ga830130
"- plop!
- EEEEEEK!
- I'm almost afraid to ask what happened here.",ga830131
"- QUICK! QUICK! PUT POOKY'S ARM BACK ON!
- Relax, Garfield. I'll fix Pooky right up. It's no big deal.
- No big deal?! Look, buster. I've never lost a loved one before.",ga830201
"-
- I sewed Pooky's arm back on as good as new, Garfield.
- Yes, but will he ever play the piano again? Me thinks the cat doth expect too much.",ga830202
"- You did a pretty good job of sewing Pooky's arm on.
- I used small stitches so as not no leave a scar.
- I think he's picking on me.",ga830203
"- Pooky, when you lost your arm, I got to thinking about our mortality, and that's depressing.
- So promise me you'll never lose your arm again, okay?",ga830204
"- I wonder what my fortune cookie is.
- Today you will be whisked away to a large white building where all you have to do is lie in bed all day as lots of people pay attention to you and bring you food.
- That sounds too good to be true.",ga830205
"-
-
- I can stare anything down.
-
-
- Uh, Garfield, fish can't blink.
- Now he tells me...now that my eyeballs are all dried out?",ga830206
"- I wonder what awful thing is going to happen to me today? Maybe the sky will fall. Maybe Odie will bring his long lost twin brother home...
-
- Or worse yet, maybe Nermal will come for a visit.",ga830207
"- Oh sure, you're getting all the attention right now, Nermal, But when you grow up you'll be as unloved as I am.
- I'm never growing up. Who are you? Peter Pan or something?
- I'm a midget. Some cats get all the luck.",ga830208
"- If you want to be cute like me, you have to play wit a ball of yarn. That sounds simple enough.
- Yours is over there.
- I hate him",ga830209
"- Nermal, you're so sweet, why don't I just stuff you into this sugar bowl.
- Go ahead and try it, fat boy.
- Say, Garfield, Where's Nermal? At a humility lesson.",ga830210
"- You disgust me, Nermal.
- You're a wide-eyed, mindless, little piece of fluff. You're so cute everyone loves you.
- Eat your heart out, bozo. I am, I am.",ga830211
"- Unk. You've overstayed your welcome.
-
- Where's Nermal? You know...I was strange, he muttered ""unk"" and then left without a word.",ga830212
"- And just when I thought it was safe to go back in the kitchen.
- Garfield, why don't you like to take baths? Bathing robs cats of precious natural oils that protect us from skin disease.
- What do you know? Hop in there right now. Let me get my tubby toys.
- Today, today.
-
- There now, don't you feel much better? Much.",ga830213
"- Are you sure you want to watch this, Garfield?
- It's a depressing movie about a man-eating lion that terrorizes a native village.
- You root for your side, I'll root for mine. Lion.",ga830214
"- I hate movies about man-eating lions.
- How can an animal possibly prey on an innocent victim?
- Explain that to the chicken you had for dinner.",ga830215
"- OH, NO! THE LION RAN DOWN ANOTHER VILLAGER! The original fast-food franchise.
- Now what disgusting is the lion doing?
- He's spitting the spear out.",ga830216
"- Tell me when the lion is finished eating the villager, okay, Garfield? You can look now.
- EEEEEK!
- He wasn't done yet! Oh, I thought you meant the MAIN parts.",ga830217
"- GOOD! They shot the lion!
- What do you think of those apples, Garfield? Big deal.
- At the gun it was villagers:1, lion:42.",ga830218
"- Well, what do you think of the man-eating lion movie?
-
- You know I hate that, Garfield.",ga830219
"- That ice should be good for some yuks.
- Ice, one. Odie, nothing.
- Watch this.
- Air mail!
- Have a nice trip, Jon!
- OH NO!
- MY TOMATO PASTE!",ga830220
"- Z
- BARK!",ga830221
"-
- Oh, a heat vent.
- The next best thing to my sunbeam.",ga830222
"-
- Jogging is much more enjoyable if you have the proper motivation.
- Ding Dong ICE CREAM",ga830223
"- I'd better save some of this blueberry pie for Jon. To eat it all would be inconsiderate and selfish.
-
- I am what I am.",ga830224
"- This is called a bird feeder, Garfield.
- And this is called putting birdseed into the bird feeder.
- He can call it what he likes. I call it baiting the trap.",ga830225
"- WOW! LOOK AT ALL THIS GOOD FOOD AND NEAT CLOTHING!
- This is great stuff.
- Stay out of the trash, Garfield. How did you know?",ga830226
"- Oboy! Jellybeans!
- These green jellybeans are pretty tasty.
- I don't care if they are Jon's favorite, I'm going to eat them all.
- Why, hello there, Odie.
- Here, you may have the last green jellybean.
- Aren't I sweet?
- My last green jellybean! I'm going to kill you, Odie! The plot thickens.",ga830227
"- I hate mondays.
- Maybe if I tore mondays off the calendar there'd be no more mondays. RIP!",ga830228
"- There must be an easier way to eat.
- GO AHEAD AND START WITHOUT ME, BREAKFAST.
- Burp...I should have thought of that long ago.",ga830301
"- What a unique perspective. Noe the ceiling is the floor and the floor is the ceiling. Hi, Garfield.
- ZIP
- Whatever goes down, must come up.",ga830302
"- I wonder whose glasses there are.
-
- Pablo Picasso's.",ga830303
"- I feel good today. I feel strong.
- I feel invincible. I feel as tall as a skyscraper.
- Get off there, King Kong. ayieeee",ga830304
"- *
- Hop up here, Garfield. It's dinner time.
- ""hop up here,"" he says.",ga830305
"- I feel like a change of pace.
- I think I'll move in slow-motion today.
- Wha!?
-
- Oh, no, you don't.
-
- It's hard to take what you want in life when they see you coming.",ga830306
"- Uh-oh, there's a package for me.
- I don't think I'm going to like it.
- Beware of gifts bearing air holes.",ga830307
"- Gee, I hope this package doesn't have a bomb or a monster in it.
- GASP! IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN MY MOST HIDEOUS FEARS!
- It's another sweater for me from Jon's mother.",ga830308
"-
- scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
- I hate wool sweaters.",ga830309
"-
- There is one thing I like about this sweater.
- Z",ga830310
"-
- There's more than one way to skin a cat.
- TWANG
- Check that...CHOKE a cat.",ga830311
"- I hate designer sweaters.
- Look at this.
- The lizard chewed the armpit out of it.",ga830312
"- Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo PLOP
- Garfield need a better balanced diet. So I'm disguising this liver as dessert.
- Why, hello, Garfield. I fixed a yummy treat for you.
- I call it ""Sweet Surprise""
- He'll be surprised, all right.
- ARRGH! He ate it! He ate it! Surprise.",ga830313
"- Hey, Garfield, look at what I got at the barber shop.
- Th-dah! What do you think? It's tacky, tasteless and disgusting.
- It's you.",ga830314
"- Bingo!
- Hook shot!
- Ha-ha-ha, Garfield, ha-ha-ha-",ga830315
"- Jon sure looks dumb with this fake mustache.
- Very few people can wear a mustache.
- Like evil Roy Gato, for instance.",ga830316
"- Nyah, nyah, nyaaah, evil Roy Gato does his daily dirty deed.
- push
-
- The mustache made me do it.",ga830317
"- Oh, there you are, Garfield.
- Let me guess...you stole my fake mustache and ate my spaghetti, right?
- How'd you guess?",ga830318
"- Give me a kiss, sweetheart.
- KISS
- How do you tell a lady her mustache needs more wax?",ga830319
"- This looks like a good spot to rest. I never saw a spot that wasn't a good spot to rest.
- Well, Garfield, here we are in the great outdoors. It's outdoors, all right, but I'd debate the ""great"".
- Just listen to the sounds of nature. Sounds like noise to me.
- Nature can actually speak to you, you know. Go on. Hear that? Nature is speaking to you now. Wait, I do hear something...
- I HEAR IT! I HEAR IT!
- Nature is saying, ""Garfield the cat, you're a long way from your warm bed and television set.""",ga830320
"- COME ON, MONDAY! DO IT TO ME NOW! THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!
- THOCK
- Thank you for your prompt consideration.",ga830321
"- Did I ever tell you about my uncle Nick? He loves to destroy things. He can shred a recliner in 12 seconds...
- Mangle ferns by the carload and turn a set of china into powder in the blink of an eye.
- He is presently a postal employee in Chicago.",ga830322
"-
- Nice try, Garfield, but I don't buy your stupid watermelon disguise.
- RATA TATTA TATTA TATA",ga830323
"-
- Don't make fun of Odie, Garfield. That's not nice.
- That's even less nice.",ga830324
"- Come and get it, Garfield.
- CRASH!
- Your not a sailplane, you know. Oh, shut up.",ga830325
"- Dinnertime, Garfield!
- BANZAI",ga830326
"- * I hate dogs and dogs hate me, I chase the tiny ones, the big ones chase me.
- Do Not Open This Gate! Hello, what's this?
- That's an open invitation if I ever saw one.
- Of course, it may not be wise to open the gate.
- But that never stopped me before. I'll just take a little peek.
-
- Curiosity mangled the cat.",ga830327
"- PUNT
- This is turning out to be a decent Monday for a change.
- POOMP!",ga830328
"- gobble gobble gobble
- Garfield, you eat too fast. No, I don't.
- I'm just overqualified for the job.",ga830329
"- Garfield will never reach this pie up here.
- CHINK
- And just where are you going? For my morning scale?",ga830330
"- ARRRRGH!
- What a horrible nightmare! I dreamt I was a dog.
- Thank goodness it was only a dream. scratch scratch scratch",ga830331
"- No more of this sniveling sissy stuff.
- I'm getting out of this tree like a man.
- On the other hand, sniveling does have its attributes.",ga830401
"- I gotta get out of this tree.
- Oh well, they tell me a cat always lands on his feet.
- However, THEY failed to mention the pain.",ga830402
"-
-
-
-
-
-
- We must have lunch sometime. Things aren't always as they seem.",ga830403
"- Hey, Garfield, let's take a vacation.
- We'll go someplace tropical.
- Save your money. Go sit in your aquarium.",ga830404
"- Vacation is going to be so great, Garfield.
- We'll get away from this rat race. There'll be no hassles.
- A change of pace would be nice.",ga830405
"- Hey, Garfield, what do you think of this shirt for our vacation?
- Tah-dah! That's awful.
- Do you know how many turkeys were destroyed to make that shirt?",ga830406
"- Good news, Garfield! The airline has a special allowing children to fly free. So?
- So when you leave on vacation, you can pose as my son and ride up front. I will not demean myself by dressing up as some stupid kid.
- Otherwise, you'll have to ride in a kitty carrier in the baggage compartment. DADDY!",ga830407
"- I hope you don't mind flying, Garfield.
- Some animals don't travel well. Nonsense.
- If a dog can be a World War I flying ace, I can surely fly commercial.",ga830408
"- Just bear in mind, Garfield, even though we're leaving on vacation...
- And even though we're going to have fun...
- It's always nice to get back home.",ga830409
"- This is going to be fun, Garfield. Ha ha ha, wheee.
- I think you'll like flying. I'd like it if I could keep one paw on the ground.
- Oooooh, I think I'm getting airsick.
- What's that? It sounds like a wing cable fraying!
- I SMELL SMOKE! sniff sniff
- WE'RE GOING DOWN IN FLAMES!
- We're still on the ground, Garfield. GREAT! CATS AND CHILDREN FIRST!",ga830410
"- Tell me, Garfield.
- Are you nervous about flying?
- I take no chances.",ga830411
"- I think you'll enjoy flying, Garfield.
- It's a very comfortable and smooth way to travel.
- Then what are these little bags for? The easter egg hunt?",ga830412
"- No pets allowed. This is my son. He has a body hair problem.
- How old are you, sonny? Rowr.
- That's baby talk for ""one going on two"".",ga830413
"- crunch crunch
- What do you think of airline meals, Garfield? GULP
- The only thing with food content was the plastic fork I just ate.",ga830414
"-
-
- The captain has advised that the ""Fasten Seat Belt"" sign be observed in case some slight air turbulence is encountered.",ga830415
"- Well, Garfield, how did you like your first airplane ride? Aside from the nausea, cramps and indigestion, I'm fine.
- Have a nice day. HAVE A NICE DAY?!
- LET HER LIVE, GARFIELD! LET HER LIVE!",ga830416
"- Ah, this is the life, isn't it, Garfield?
- For real relaxation, it's hard to beat the tropics. Oh, go sit on a sandburg.
- You should go play in the surf, Garfield. Maybe next year.
- There are fish out there, you know. Well, why didn't you say so?! Ha ha ha.
- Simple cat, simple pleasures.",ga830417
"- Do you know what I love about the tropics, Garfield? I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
- It's the miles and miles of sparkling beach.
- It may be a beach to you, but it's just a sandbox to me.",ga830418
"- There's one thing I love about the tropics. grrrr
- FLIP!
- The tiny dogs.",ga830419
"- You don't seem to be having a good time, Garfield. A keen observation.
- What's the problem? I tell you what you do.
- Find the biggest, heaviest fur coat you can and put it on. Then go lie in the blazing sun for a few hours and see how many youks you have.",ga830420
"- Tell me, my little wahine, what do you do? I'll bet you walk along the beach all day, then go home to your little thatched hut at night, right?
- I'm a computer programmer from Cleveland.
- Close. How about a date? He didn't even blink.",ga830421
"- This is the life, isn't it, Garfield? More fun than a cat should have.
- Nothing to do but lie here in the sun. Listening to your brain bake.
- Are you bored, Garfield? Is there sand in your swimsuit?",ga830422
"- This is going to upset you, Garfield...
- Because I know you've had a great time.
- But it's time we think about going home.",ga830423
"- La la la
- There's nothing like a bubble bath to cure what ails you, Garfield.
- pop pop
-
-
- POW! Hey, Jon, what happened to you guys? You wouldn't believe me if I told you.",ga830424
"- Dear Garfield, what is your favorite all-time film?
- It's ""Old Yeller"".
- I love movies with happy endings.",ga830425
"-
-
- And just what do you think you're doing? Asserting my cathood?",ga830426
"- Garfield, why is it cats like to get out at night?
- That's when we like to sing on fences.
- In the daylight, we'd be easy targets.",ga830427
"- Today is thursday, and that's lasagna day.
- Here's your cat food, Garfield. Will there be anything else?
- Let me jog your memory.",ga830428
"- Why do you have such large teeth, Garfield?
- All the better to eat you with, my dear.
- Stop that! Obviously, sir, you are not a patron of the classics.",ga830429
"- I saw an awful movie last night called ""Alien Dog."" It was about this gigantic mutt that terrorized the world.
- However, they did dispatch him with a rather clever ploy.
- They electrified a 12-story fire hydrant.",ga830430
"- This looks like a good day for some heavy thoughts.
- Let's put this whole thing in perspective.
- Eating is important.
- And sleeping is important.
- But nothing is more important than holding someone you love.
- Check that.
- Reciprocation is nice, too.",ga830501
"- You're too fat, Garfield. Hang it in your ear.
- Oh, shut up, Odie.
- Why do I have the feeling there's a conspiracy afoot?",ga830502
"- *
- ARRRGH!
- It's diet week. It's diet week.",ga830503
"-
- I gotta get off this diet.
- It's starting to mess with my mind.",ga830504
"-
-
- Release my hand, Garfield.
- You release hamburger, I release hand.",ga830505
"- Suicide, exercise and dieting.
- RIP!
- Name three forms of self-abuse. True...how true.",ga830506
"-
-",ga830507
"- *
-
- Oh, no! My watch has stopped!
- I've missed Garfield's mealtime.
- Pets have a way of letting you know when you've missed their mealtime.
- You're late. I know, I know.",ga830508
"- Tell me, Garfield, when you walk, do your right and left legs travel together, or do you use your opposing legs?
-
- I'll never walk again.",ga830509
"- Z Z Z I wonder how birds can sleep in trees without falling out.
- Z Z Z
- Z Z Z Aha! ...hammocks.",ga830510
"- This is the only way to spend a sunny afternoon.
- All you need is a swimming pool.
- And a good imagination.",ga830511
"- I'm going to take a dip in here, so beat it, bird, before I break your beak.
-
- I have a mouth with a death wish.",ga830512
"- Take my advice. Sun yourself in a pool. You stay cooler that way.
- I shall now turn over in order to tan my back.
- This is not well thought out.",ga830513
"- As much as I hate to do it...
- I'd better get out.
- Even my fur is getting wrinkled.",ga830514
"- Look at those stupid dogs.
- Yabba yabba yabba.
- ROWF! BARK! BARK!
- BARK! YIP! BARK!
- Go away, dogs. Leave my cat alone.
- bbbbbb
- You just had to get in the last lick, didn't you, Garfield? Me and my big tongue.",ga830515
"- Hey, Garfield, guess what! We're going to visit dad and mom on the farm this week.
- We'll eat some of mom's down-home cooking and help dad with the farm work.
- Good thinking, Jon. Let's drive all the way to the sticks and fetch us an apple pie and a hernia.",ga830516
"- Your brother, Doc, has come back to work on the farm. He's here now.
- Doc boy! Don't call me ""Doc boy"".
- Jon boy! Mom boy! Doc boy! How are you? Oh boy.",ga830517
"- What brings you to the farm, Jon? I promised Garfield some good home cooking.
- What would you boys like for breakfast?
- My guess is Garfield would like some ham and eggs.",ga830518
"- Doc, you're looking more like dad all the time.
- You take that back!
- SMACK! Hush up, boy. The three stooges live.",ga830519
"- You know, Doc, for brothers, we don't look much alike.
- It's hard to believe we came from the same place.
- You mean, the farm? The funny farm maybe.",ga830520
"- Take care now. See you soon. Don't be a stranger.
- So long! Bye bye! Bye now. Se yuh.
- I can't believe the fuss they make over going to bed. You have a very close family.",ga830521
"- skitter skitter skitter
- That's odd...two little bugs in full Shakespearean dress.
- Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? I'm right here, Juliet. I bring bad news, Julie baby. Our families are feuding and don't want us to date anymore. Oh no!
- That does it! Let's die in each other's arms and live together in eternity. How do we do that?
- Here's how. squash
- I'm not one to fool with great literature.",ga830522
"- Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me.
- Hi, Arlene. Hi, bozo.
- I'm sure she meant to say, ""Hunk"".",ga830523
"- Let's go mousing. What's wrong with lasagna?
- There's no thrill of pursuit.
- Obviously, you've never snatched one off the table during sundae dinner.",ga830524
"- Why do girls always so good, Arlene?
- We wear perfume.
- Sounds kind of sissified to me.
- I get this from a sex that likes to tattoo themselves.",ga830525
"- What does the moon remind you of, Garfield?
- The moon reminds me of night, and that reminds me of sleep, which reminds me of breakfast...
- That wasn't what I had in mind. Then, after breakfast, comes my nap...",ga830526
"- I'm taking you to a great restaurant tonight, Arlene.
- bonk bonk Look, galvanized, not one of those cheap plastic places.
- Now I've seen it all...a three-star garbage can.",ga830527
"- I'll see you, Arlene. It is customary, in human circles, to kiss a lady's hand.
- You're not a human, and that's not a hand. That's a hairy paw.
- Oil and water, nitro and glycerin, chivalry and realism.",ga830528
"-
- I have a new plant in here, Garfield. Yum yum.
- And I don't want you messing with it, okay? Sure.
-
- First I think I'll eat its tender little leaves, then I'll pick my teeth with its stems, followed by stomping the rest of the plant out of existence.
- Prepare to die!
- How did you like my cactus, Garfield? Prepare to die.",ga830529
"- I'm going out to a very nice restaurant tonight, Garfield. So you be good while I'm gone.
- And, no, you can't come with me.
- Who said I wanted to go to your crummy restaurant, anyway?",ga830530
"- Jon is going out without us tonight, Odie.
- So you know what to do...
- You chew his slippers and I'll destroy his chair.",ga830531
"- GARFIELD! LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO MY CHAIR!
- I DON'T DESERVE THIS!
- I was only gone for the evening. Now I know the face. Weren't you a former owner of mine?",ga830601
"- Garfield, I know being a cat owner is a big responsibility.
- BUT I SHOULD Be ABLE TO LEAVE FOR AN EVENING WITHOUT YOU DESTROYING EVERYTHING!
- I WANT A DIVORCE! I get half of everything.",ga830602
"-
- squirt
- OKAY! WHO GREASED MY WIENER?",ga830603
"- Hey, Garfield, What do you think of the new turtleneck sweater mom made you?
- You're right.
- It isn't very flattering, is it?",ga830604
"- I'm in a ""what if"" mood today.
- I wonder what would happen if I married Arlene.
- We'd have a huge wedding...
- Then we'd raise some kittens...
- And they'd crawl all over me.
- Forget it! I'd make a lousy father.",ga830605
"- Garfield, it's noon. Are you getting out of bed?
- I'd love to get up...
- But the blanket is extra heavy today.",ga830606
"-
- Think about a big, juicy bone, Odie.",ga830607
"- Z

- Z",ga830608
"- Garfield, meet my new pet frog, ""Herbie"".
- Isn't he great? Yeh, good ol' ""Herbie"".
- Good ol' ""your days are numbered as soon as Jon turns his back, Herbie"".",ga830609
"- zzzzzzzz
- Hey, Garfield, when was the last time you saw my pet frog, Herbie? zzzzz
- SNAK! At lunch.",ga830610
"- It seems like an age since I gave Odie a boot.
- BOOT!
- I'm just a sentimental fool.",ga830611
"- Something's wrong.
- Hey, Garfield! Let's have some fun! forget it, Jon.
- I want to take you to an Italian restaurant for a lasagna dinner. No way.
- They have ferns for dessert. Big deal.
- Then we can come home and I'll hold Odie down while you beat him up. Try and make me.
-
- How did you know we have an appointment at the vet's? I don't know. I just know.",ga830612
"- In this box, I have a singing and dancing mouse. I have spent four years training him. He will now entertain you.
-
- I guess I should have cut air holes in the box.",ga830613
"- It's hard to believe I'm going to be five years old this sundae.
- Shucks, golly, gee-whiz, ratso.
- I'm going to have to start watching my language.",ga830614
"- Garfield, I hope the sun shines on your birthday.
- What a nice thing to say.
- I'm going camping. I didn't need that.",ga830615
"-
- Mother nature has certainly been kind to you, Garfield.
- I wish I could say the same for father time.",ga830616
"- They say the first thing to go on a cat is its hearing.
-
- Or was that eyesight?",ga830617
"- Your birthday gift is inside the card, Garfield.
- Someday, my signature will be worth a lot of money!",ga830618
"- sssh
- This is the perfect surprise. It's much too early for Garfield to be up.
- He's a year older today, you know.
- SURPRISE!
-
- And a year sneakier.",ga830619
"- BARK!
- FUMP!
- Amoeba Man strikes again.",ga830620

"- Sticking to your diet, Garfield? Yup.
- FUMP
- But I did eat the pictures out of your cookbook.",ga830819

- You claw the drapes, shed on the furniture, steal my food and hassle the dog.
- Nobody's perfect.",ga830830
"- Garfield's in for a surprise. I put an alarm on the refrigerator.
- That's the first rule for successfully living with a cat.
- You must be smarter than the cat.",ga830831
"- Given the choice, Garfield, would you rather be rich or famous?
- You're talking to a cat here, fella. All I need is a warm lap, some good food and a little attention.

- Okay, Pooky, pay attention now. Are you ready?

"- I'm getting too old to have a teddy bear.
- It's not that I feel silly...
- It's the peer pressure.",ga830927

- How one well-turned phrase from that woman can suck all the wind out of your sails.",ga831013
"- Arlene, I'm sick of the witmatching mood you're in.

- Maybe a change of surroundings would cheer us up. Check.

"- Here you go, Garfield. Take a big bite.
- OH NO!
- Just kidding.",ga831121
"-
- SLAM! Yo, Garfield! What'cha doing?
- Casting a critical eye on a career as a doorstep.",ga831122
"- Sitting atop this door, I see all and know all.
- Now where's that fat cat of mine?
- Don't take my name in vain. SMACK!",ga831123
"- Perching high on a door gives vent to a cat's philosophical bent.
- Observing life from an omniscient point of view allows one to witness fascinating human rituals.
- Like Jon cleaning his ear. squeak squeak",ga831124
"- I wish I knew how to get off this door.
- Sometimes it would be nice to have all the decisions made for you.
- SLAM! and sometimes not.",ga831125
"- PLOP
- Where did you come from, Garfield?
- Rumor has it the stork brought me.",ga831126
"-
-
-
-
-
-
- They didn't call me the shimmy king for nothing.",ga831127
"- I hate mondays. I can't shake this awful feeling that something dreadful is going to happen to me.
- I'm saved! It's nice to see a friendly face.
- You're going to the vet, Garfield. ARRRGH!",ga831128
"- You don't look happy, Garfield.
- Happy about going to the clinic? Put yourself in my shoes.
- You get to flirt with the lady vet while I get the business end of her thermometer.",ga831129
"- Did you know I'm a medical curiosity, doc? I'm not surprised.
- I'm missing a major organ. Your brain?
- My heart, you've stolen it away. I hate to see a doctor cry.",ga831130
"- I'd like to make another appointment, Liz. Sure, when?
- How about Friday night for dinner?
- NO! Subtle but firm.",ga831201
"- Your cat is in good health, Mr. Arbuckle. Dandy. Now let's talk about us.
- Let's do. Really?
- You owe me forty dollars. I just adore love patter.",ga831202
"- Hi, Odie.
-
- If that dog's brain were a car, it would be jammed in neutral.",ga831203
"- GASP!
- OH NO! WE'RE OUT OF COFFEE!
- This is your fault, you guzzler! You didn't buy any!
- Look at us, Garfield. We're getting irritable and shaky. We need coffee!
- SNIFF...WHAZAT?! ZAT!S COFFEE!
- EEEK! LOOK, HUBERT! PEEPING TOMS! Don't flatter yourself, Reba. Now go hide the silver.",ga831204
"- It's time you earn your keep around here, Garfield. There's a mouse hole and there's some cheese. You know what to do.
- I certainly do.",ga831205
"- Here's the scenario: cat crouches by cheese waiting for mouse to exit hole to retrieve same. Cat catches mouse. Fade out. The End.
- Heck with it.
- I prefer stories with a happy ending.",ga831206
"- Why should I have to catch an innocent little mouse? I have nothing against him. In fact, he's kind of lovable.
- If you don't catch that mouse, I'm putting you out i the cold!
- The furry twerp dies.",ga831207
"- This is demeaning. I have a noble heritage. I am a unique, vital individual.
- And all I'm considered as around here is a mousetrap.
- I must speak to my kitty litter changer about that.",ga831208
"- I don't want to catch that mouse. He's cute. I've even nicknamed him...
-
- ""Stretch""",ga831209
"-
-
- Live and let live, I say.",ga831210
"- * _ I'm just a ramlin' kind of guy...ramlin', ramblin'
- rambl
-
- Oh, no! I've heard terrible things about city sewers!
- They say the pet alligators that are flushed into the sewers grow to huge proportions.
- But this is ridiculous.",ga831211
"- OH NO! DON'T MAKE ME DO IT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!
- TURN BACK! TURN BACK!
- Sometimes, a cat's feet just gotta climb.",ga831212
"- Here I am, stuck up a tree. Things couldn't be worse.
- Okay, okay, NOW things couldn't be worse.
- BOOM",ga831213
"- I maybe stranded up a tree...
- But at least I'm on a sturdy limb.
- The story of my life.",ga831214
"- Hey, fatso. What does a bird like you eat?
- Cats.
- chirp chirp",ga831215
"- This isn't safe.
- Shoo! Shoo! Somebody might get hurt!
- TOING!",ga831216
"- A way down! All I have to do is dive into that birdbath.
-
- 7.0 6.5",ga831217
"- Uh-oh, I feel a sneeze coming on!
- Wah, wah.
- WAH! WAH! WAH!
- WACHOO!
- Auntie em! Auntie em! Yeah, I got you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.",ga831218
"- 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hope that St. Nicholas soon would be there; FILL THIS ONE, SANTA!
- The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugarplums danced in their heads; NOW GIMME A VISION OF LASAGNA
- And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. THIS IS MY KIND OF STORY.",ga831219
"- When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. WHAT'S A SASH?
- The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the luster of midday to objects below. When, what to my wondering eyes should appear. But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer. THEY LOOK BIGGER ON TELEVISION.
- With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. OR MAYBE SANTA CLAUS.",ga831220
"- More rapid than eagles his coursers they came. And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; ""Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen! ON, DOPEY! ON, SNEEZY! ON, HAPPY!
- ""To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all! CAN'T THEY JUST WALK ANYWHERE?
- As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the housetop the coursers, they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too. TUNE IN TOMORROW. THE GOOD PART'S COMING.",ga831221
"- And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. OH, NO! A CHIMNEY MONSTER!
- He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. YOU DIDN'T BREAK ANY TOYS; DID YOU?
- His eyes-how they twinkled! His dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow; HE ALSO HAS A WELL-ROUNDED PERSONALITY.",ga831222
"- The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth. And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed, like a bowiful of jelly. HO! HO! HO! A FEW SIT-UPS WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT, FELLA.
- He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf. And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. WE MUST HAVE LUNCH SOMETIME.
- He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, and laying his finger aside of his nose. And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; HOW DID HE DO THAT?",ga831223
"- He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like to down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, are he drove out of sight,
- HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! WHAT A NICE GUY, WHAT A NICE STORY.
- Have a happy and loving holiday season.",ga831224
"-
- Merry Christmas, Garfield. I got you some great presents!
- Here is a radio controlled mouse...
- And a mink scratching post!
- ptoo
- Odie, that bone is everything you own in the world.
- It's the expensive gifts that impress me.",ga831225
"- Heh he rattle rattle
- Cats have such active imaginations. I wonder what's going on in Garfield's mind right now.
- Well...here I am, in a brown paper bag.",ga831226
"- Interesting.
- Residing in a brown paper bag gives one an all-new perspective of one's self.
- I feel like a dirty magazine.",ga831227
"- This bag needs eyeholes.
- rip rustle rustle
- Something's not right here.",ga831228
"- Got my sack, got my eyeholes, what more could a cat need?
- ARRRRGH!
- Armholes, definitely armholes.",ga831229
"- Awk! There's someone in this bag with me.
- Oh, it's you.
- Hello, bellybutton.",ga831230
"- fffff
- POW!
- I didn't know you were in the bag, Garfield. I was playing a trick on Odie. At least I died for a good cause.",ga831231
"- Oh boy, what a party, I ate too much.
- I gotta get up and exercise. Here I go.
- Okay, here I go o the count of three...one, two, three and up!
- Up...up and exercise. Come on, Garfield. You can do it.
- This time I'm really going to do it. Here go the legs lifting the body...now!
- This time I'm really, really going to do it...one, two, three...Hi ya!
- Have you been up today, Garfield? I think so.",ga840101
"- Rise and shine, Garfield, It's a bright new day!
- It's gonna be a wonderful day, a great day!
- I think I overcheerfuled it.",ga840102
"- How do you want your coffee, Garfield? Make it sit up and bark.
- How's this?
- Just right.",ga840103
"-
-
- Oh, no! It's the old ""Disguise the tongue as a loaf of french bread"" trick!",ga840104
"- Okay, who loosened the top on my saltshaker?!
- Garfield, that wasn't very nice. You're right, that wasn't very nice.
- But it was extremely funny.",ga840105
"- Go outside and play, Garfield.
- Have a good time.
- ""Have a good time."" he says.",ga840106
"-
- Hey, Garfield, don't eat the lasagna yet...
- It's still too hot. You're telling me?",ga840107
"-
-
-
-
-
-",ga840108
"- Don't eat me. You're too fat already!
- Who are you? This is your conscience speaking.
- I don't have a conscience. I know. I'm free-lancing.",ga840109
"- If you are my conscience, what are you doing in my food bowl? I took on a form you would understand.
- What do you really look like? Well, if you must know...
- I look like everyone's mother. Natch.",ga840110
"- Tell me, conscience, just what does a conscience do?
- It is my duty to make you feel bad about things that make you feel good.
- That's sad. It's a living.",ga840111
"- Well, conscience, if you don't mind, I'll go to bed now. Tah tah
- Look both ways before crossing the street.
- What's that supposed to mean? Sorry, it was just a knee-jerk nag.",ga840112
"- I can't believe my conscience is following me around. I must be cracking up.
- A little nap-nap should clear my head.
- You sleep too much. ACK",ga840113
"- Don't you think you should be getting up now?
- Look, conscience, get out of my life. I have no use for you. Careful, fella. or I'll call my big brother.
- Who's he? Guilt. On the jogging track in 5 minutes, sucker! Be there!",ga840114
"- Good morning, ham, good morning, eggs, good morning, milk.
- There's one nice thing about visiting the farm...
- The food is fresh.
- Here, lunch. Here, lunch.
- Uh-oh.
- This is not good.
- Garfield! Where have you been?! At Custer's last stand.",ga840115
"- I love it when the good humor man comes. DING DING
- I love it when I get a popsicle.
- I hate it when my lips stick to the *@!! popsicle.",ga840116
"- Ever notice how moths circle the light?
- Like planets orbiting a distant sun.
- I love it when I get philosophical.",ga840117
"- I wonder what happens when a moth gets too close to the light.
- AYIEEEE! FOOM!
- At least he didn't suffer.",ga840118
"- Let us examine a pet phenomenon called the ""rips"".
- That's when your pets race around the house for no apparent reason.
- Other than to mangle the family cat.",ga840119
"- You boys stop racing around.
- Garfield, slow down!
- Okay.",ga840120
"- Would you like to go for a walk, Odie?
- Let's see...I need a leash.
- You stay out of this.",ga840121
"-
- I love sacks.
- I wouldn't kid you, Parnelli. This honey will do 0-60 in 6 seconds flat.
- I swear, Sally, get your head out of the sand. The sack dress is coming back.
- I think I'll step into the root cellar and see what's for dinner.
- OH, NO!
- Hello, maintenance? Call the exterminator, my condo has dogs.",ga840122
"-
- Good morning, Garfield. It's me, Nermal. I'm young and good-looking and you're not.
- I didn't need that.",ga840123
"- Can I get you anything for breakfast, Garfield?
- Yeah, how about a big glass of freshly-squeezed kitten juice?
- You don't like me, don't you?",ga840124
"- How cute! Nermal brought me my newspaper!
- And my slippers and my pipe! What more could a man want?
- How about a woman?",ga840125
"- Let's get you into trouble, Nermal.
- Look in the cookie jar! Look in the cookie jar! No, you can't have a cookie, Garfield, You'll spoil dinner.
- Thanks for the cookies. Jeff would have known what Lassie was talking about.",ga840126
"-
- BLUT! BLUT!
- Call it cruel. Call it juvenile. I call it asserting myself.",ga840127
"- I hate to bother you, sir, but you put insufficient postage on your package.
- What package?
- This kitten you're sending to Abu Dhabi. GARFIELD",ga840128
"- Poor me.
- What a yucky evening.
- It's dark and rainy and there's nothing on television.
- I crave sunshine, daisy-filled meadows and good times. I need a ticket out of here.
- Wait a minute! I have one! SNAP!",ga840129
"- I wonder how fast I can run.
- I wonder what would happen if I hit this kitty door at Mach 2.
- I wonder if killing a mailman is a federal offense.",ga840130
"- I love attacking the mailman. Some days I scratch him. Some days I bite him. Some days I trip him.
- Today I'm trying something new. *
- I'm humiliating him.",ga840131
"- *
- ARRRGH! b-b-b-b
- When he comes around, he'll thank me for breaking up the monotony of his dreary job.",ga840201
"- Come on, mailman, deliver that mail.
- And when you do, I'm going to leap on you and all that will be left will be your mailbag and that silly-looking hat of yours.
- Has the mailman come yet, Garfield? No, he's still standing at the end of the sidewalk sobbing.",ga840202
"- SLAM!
- Rats! I missed him!
- Apparently, no one ever told him to look both ways before crossing the street. SCREECH",ga840203
"- Be a good boy and fetch the mail, Garfield. Oui, mon capitaine.
- RIP ROWT CLOBBER BLAP
- Did you hurt him bad? Oh, just a few lacerations, abrasions and internal injuries. I was in a good mood.",ga840204
"- plop!
-
- GLUP!
- ptoo ptoo
- SPLUT!
- Salvage the pride, Garfield, salvage the pride.",ga840205
"- Hey, Garfield, it says here people can perform superhuman feats of strength during periods of great stress.
- What baloney!
- By the way, I'm taking you to the vet today.",ga840206
"- You can't hide from forever, Garfield. I'm going to find you and take you to the vet.
- You may be sneaky, but I'm sneakier.
- ""Sneaky"" is my middle name.",ga840207
"- Garfield can't resist lasagna, and when he comes to eat it, I'm going to catch him and take him to the vet.
- SMACK GULP SLURP
- That cat has the longest lips I've ever seen.",ga840208
"- Now where could Garfield be?
- He's not in tie cookies, and he certainly won't be in the doggie biscuits.
- POO! It's a good thing I can't read.",ga840209
"- Aha! There you are, Garfield! You're going to the vet now.
-
- Sorry, Odie. SMACK",ga840210
"- I wish I could find Garfield's hiding place so I could take him to the vet.
- He's sure hiding in a good place.
- A good place-- Not a smart place-- But a good place.",ga840211
"- I can't believe my luck. This is too perfect.
- I will now slide down this banister and make a four-point landing on Odie down there.
- BANZAI!
-
- RATS!
- I can see the headline now: ""Twist in plot fatal to local cat"".",ga840212
"- Wouldn't it be great if everything could talk?
- I'd get out of bed and the wall would say, ""Good morning, Jon."" and the sink would say, ""Good morning, Jon."" That wouldn't be so hot.
- Every time a light bulb burned out, it would be like a death in the family.",ga840213
"- If people had hair all over their bodies, would they wear clothing?
-
- Probably not.",ga840214
"- What would happen if people were cats and cats were people?
- That's an easy one.
- Dogs would soon be extinct.",ga840215
"- I was wondering, Garfield...
- What if being fat were considered attractive?
- What do you mean, ""what if,"" bozo?",ga840216
"- I wonder what life would be like if we never had to eat.
- That would take some getting used to.
- For a time, mothers would fix their families three square nothings a day.",ga840217
"- What if there were never a Leonardo da Vinci?
- That would be awful!
- The da Vinci kids would have been orphans.",ga840218
"- RING!
- BRING! SMASH!
- DING DING DING DING
- STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- GASP! COUGH WHEEzeeee
- SHOOP!
- Rats! Too late! Now I'm wide awake.",ga840219
"- I hate mondays.
- This is your conscience speaking. It's not nice to hate mondays. Look at it as starting a fresh week with a clean slate.
- I hate mondays.",ga840220
"- This is your conscience speaking. Don't you dare push Odie off the table! That would be inhumane and cruel.
- Then YOU push him off. POKE!
- That was kind of fun.",ga840221
"- Why do you follow me around, conscience? If I don't you won't be very nice.
- If I put this cork in your bottle would you be trapped? Yes, but that wouldn't be very nice.
- That wasn't very nice.",ga840222
"- Now that my conscience is trapped in this bottle, I can walk away and enjoy myself.
- That's okay, go ahead, have fun, don't worry about me. I'll just sit here in the dark...all alone.
- You're very good. One of the best.",ga840223
"- Let's have some fun, Garfield. Take one step back. Okay.
-
- I thought consciences were supposed to be nice! I'm on break.",ga840224
"- I have my conscience trapped in this bottle. I'll just set it by Jon.
-
- Get a haircut.",ga840225
"- tappity tappity tappity
- Good evening, ladies and germs. In our audience tonight is a boy scout delegation from Booga-Booga. Welcome, guys.
- I'm dedicating my first song to you. Appropriately enough it's called, ""I'm just a boy scouting for the key to your heart"".
- HEY!
- All right, you Booga-Booga boobs!
- If you're going to throw anything, throw money, okay? ...okay.
- CLOBBER
- Silly me, I forgot the only currency in Booga-Booga is 800-pound chariot wheels.",ga840226
"- What a glorious morning!
- I could really enjoy a morning like this.
- If I could only get this catch out of my back.",ga840227
"- I gotta get help for this catch in my back.
- Hey, guys.
- What we have here is a failure to communicate.",ga840228
"- Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get rid of this catch in my back.
-
- Maybe not.",ga840229
"- I hate having a catch in my back. I get no sleep, I get no food, I get no exercise.
-
- Don't tip the cat over, Odie. I get no respect.",ga840301
"- Well hello there, Mr. Stuck-Up.
- Having a catch in one's back does tend to give one an air of sophistication...
- I could get to like this.",ga840302
"- Let's take care of that catch in your back, Garfield.
- CRINK!
- There you go, old buddy. Thanks, I think.",ga840303
"- Hey, look! Odie!
- It snowed last night!
- Ha ha, so you boys want to play in the snow, huh?
- First you'll have to wear your nice, warm pet sweaters.
- And your wool caps and mittens and mufflers and booties.
- There you go, boys.
- Having fun yet? Ha ha ha, wheee.",ga840304
"- Who's that painting at my door?
- HONK HONK
- Oh, good morning, Odie. HONK",ga840305
"- YAWN
- GASP!
- Waking up to my own bad breath is bad enough, but someone else's is unbearable.",ga840306
"- I am proud to be a pet. Pets lend a touch of elegance to a home. SLUP SLUP
-
- I am proud to be a cat. SLUP SLUP",ga840307
"- Okay, get revved up there, Odie.
- GO!
- I love toys that don't need batteries.",ga840308
"-
- crinkle
- May I have some of that candy bar? Here, take it.",ga840309
"-
- I declare this steak the sovereign property of Garfield, the cat!
- I've never had my dinner annexed before. And you may never see it alive again.",ga840310
"-
- SMACK Let's play!
- Leave me alone, Garfield. Let's play! Let's play!
- Oh, okay, we'll play.
- TICKLE! TICKLE! TICKLE! TICKLE! HA! HA! HEE! HO! HEE! HEE!
- OUCH!
- I'm through playing now.",ga840311
"- Hey, Garfield, we're going to the farm to visit dad and mom this week.
- Goodo. I need a change of surroundings. I was getting bored with this city life.
- It will be nice to be bored in the country for a change.",ga840312
"- It's great to be back on the farm, Garfield. Nothing ever changes.
- The same old surroundings, the same old room...
- The same old chores. The same old manure.",ga840313
"- This pastoral scene is not exactly intellectually stimulating.
- Read any good books lately? Oink.
- ""Oink,"" he says. I rest my case. ""Oink"" in the existential sense, of course.",ga840314
"- Doc, do you ever regret that you stayed on the farm while I went to the city to live in the lap of luxury?
- Not really. Dad will probably will the farm to me, and I'll sell the acreage at a huge profit and retire while young.
- Need a hired hand? Give me a resume and three good references. And mom doesn't count.",ga840315
"- Beautiful sunset, isn't it, dad? Purtyer than a little red wagon goin' up a hill.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, it's just something you city boys expect us farmers to say. How true.",ga840316
"- Garfield and I must be leaving now, mom. Stay, stay! I just baked some pies.
- We gotta go. Come on, Garfield.
- Say what, stranger?",ga840317
"- WHEW!
- Today I am going to cure Garfield of his gluttony.
- Go to it, boy!
- He's either going to get sick eating all that food, or he's going to burst trying. MUNCH SMACK SLURP
- Are you going to want the rest of that hamburger?",ga840318
"- AWK!
- I love chasing birds.
- Except when they do that.",ga840319
"- BONK! Rats!
- Double rats!
- And, of course, tripe rats.",ga840320
"- Shoo!
- Flies and I have a lot in common...
- You can't keep either of us away from food.",ga840321
"- I gotta beat that fly to my food!
- I WIN!
- You lose, fella. POO",ga840322
"-
- WHEW
- BOO!",ga840323
"- *
- REARRR!
- It's the old ""bring in the reinforcements"" trick.",ga840324
"-
-
- All right, you guys! Outside!
-
-
- Where were you guys raised, in a barn? Next time use the door.
- CRASH! Thank you.",ga840325
"- GARFIELD! I CAN'T STRAIGHTEN UP!
- ZIP
- Ha, ha, my tie was caught in my zipper. Help me.",ga840326
"- Gimme those cookies.
- HIYA! HUT! KONK! PUNT!
- I'd turn her in, but who'd admit to being mangled by a girl scout?",ga840327
"- Rise and shine, Garfield!
- Garfield?
- clunk clunk Time to wash my blankey, what say?",ga840328
"- Be a good boy and fetch the morning paper, Garfield.
- Yes, master. I am your beck and call, master.
- Why can't I have a normal house cat like everyone else?",ga840329
"- I need a brain for my master.
-
- A brain, I need a brain for my master.",ga840330
"- Ah, coffee.
-
- Being a hunchback is going to take some getting used to.",ga840331
"- This is it, boys.
- Tonight we find out who the phantom ripper is.
- He's stepping out the shadows now.
- Oh, no! It's...it's you! AYIEEE!
- Good movie. click
- Who was he?
- We thought YOU were watching. SMACK GRRRRR",ga840401
"- It's Monday out there. I feel it in the air. I hate mondays.
- I'm sure the world will end on a Monday...at least I hope it does.
- It would be a shame to end the world right before a weekend.",ga840402
"- Pooky, where are you? Oh, no! My teddy bear is missing.
- This has the makings of a classic mystery. I already have some prime suspects.
- It's easy when you live with a rogue's gallery.",ga840403
"- I suspect Odie of kidnapping Pooky. Watch him crumble under my keen questioning.
- Where were you on the evening of April 1?!
- What am I doing? Odie doesn't even know where he is now.",ga840404
"- There must be clue to Pooky's disappearance here somewhere...
- Aha! could this be a telltale trail of teddy bear hair?
- Even if it isn't, that was a pretty nifty bit of alliteration.",ga840405
"- Hello, what's this? Just as my teddy bear disappears, this sack mysteriously appears...
- Something smells fishy here.",ga840406
"- Aha! Jon! It was you who kidnapped Pooky!
- Obviously, sensing I was hot on his trail and fearing my wrath, he's decided to return Pooky and throw himself on the mercy of the court.
- I had your teddy bear cleaned, Garfield. Sigh...thank you.",ga840407
"-
-
- * AROOOOOOO *
- tappity tappity clap clap clap
- I like you, Garfield.
- And I like myself, Arlene. I can take a hint.
- Like myself when I'm with you that is.",ga840408
"- It's nearly midnight on a Monday.
- I can't believe it! Nothing bad has happened to me all day.
- COO-COO!",ga840409
"- Watch this. It's the old rubber bone gag.
- SHOOP!
- Practical jokes are wasted on the stupid.",ga840410
"- SQUIT
- BLAT
- Unnnngh! Help! Help! The alien is sucking my brain dry! Garfield has raised playing with food to an art form",ga840411
"- Garfield, I think it's time we grow up, be more responsible, take a more mature outlook on life... Hee hee
- I don't think you're taking me seriously! I'm sorry.
- I don't know what came over me.",ga840412
"- Stop begging, Garfield. You may have any food that falls on the floor.
-
- I hate you. I can live with that.",ga840413
"- Hee-hee, snort.
- WAH-HA-HA!
- Okay! Okay! I'm awake!",ga840414
"- Look out, world.
- I feel invincible today.
- FOOD! I CRAVE FOOD!
- That took nearly three seconds, Jon. We'll do better next time, won't we?
- I shall take my morning stroll mow. Be a good boy and alert the media.
- Hold up, traffic. Here comes Garfield. Where were you? Learning that some things can't be intimidated.",ga840415
"-
-
- I'm sorry. Did I bring you down, old buddy? Like a rock, old buddy.",ga840416
"- I'm bored, Garfield.
- I'm tired of seeing the same old scenery. Do you know what I mean? Not really.
- At least you get to see the scenery.",ga840417
"- Garfield, there's only one way to shed this shroud of gray we wear...
- There's only one path out of this valley of gloom. There's only one sure bet to beat the boreds.
- Gather your things. We're going to vacation! I'm packed. Let's go!",ga840418
"- How much are the plane tickets? ...uh, do you have anything cheaper?
- That could be fatal!
- I don't think they want out business, Garfield. Where's the competition for the low rollers these days?",ga840419
"- Thank you very much.
- Garfield, I had to book our vacation all third-class. I hope you don't mind. That's okay.
- It's still better than this fourth-class existence at home.",ga840420
"- Let's blow this joint, Garfield.
- Hang on!
- Where did you go? To give the refrigerator a goodbye kiss.",ga840421
"- Thank heavens for these reduced airline rates, Garfield. No frills, no food, no class.
- Welcome to Inversion Layer Airlines, sir. In what section are you traveling? Uh...third class.
- What section, sir? Third class.
- I can't hear you! THIRD CLASS!
- In the back with the rest of the slime, you vermin!
- Why can't I get any respect, Garfield? In this game, you must BUY respect, my friend.",ga840422
"- I haven't seen a stewardess in hours, Garfield.
- I'm going to find out what's going on around here.
- Excuse me sir. How's the service on this airline?",ga840423
"- Hey! We're getting hungry here in third-class! What's to eat?!
- BLAT! BLAT!
- Hardtack and swill. Yum-yum. CONK! CONK!",ga840424
"- Nyah! Nyah! Nyah! Nyah!
- Mikey, it's not nice to make fun of people, even though they ARE traveling in third-class.
- NO! GARFIELD, NO! LET ME HURT 'EM JUST A LITTLE BIT!",ga840425
"-
- I know this is just the third-class exit from the plane, Garfield...
- But you'd think they'd give us a ladder or something.",ga840426
"- I would like your cheapest room for me and my cat. Yes, sir. That would be the Jack Benny suite, sir.
- Well, Garfield, there's the bed and the bathroom's down the hall. Any questions? Yes...
- Where are YOU going to sleep?",ga840427
"- All I have to do is unpack, Garfield, and we'll be ready for some rest and relaxation.
- ARRRRGH! NOT ANOTHER PET TO TAKE CARE OF!
- I don't think I can take any more surprises. Then don't look at what Odie did to your sport jacket.",ga840428
"-
- You guys have a good time, but no digging in the sand, if you know what I mean?
- Hey, baby! What's your sign?
- Careful, buddy. She's MY girl.
- Aw, go pound sand, you little twerp
-
- Well...I guess we are to do as he says, not as he does.",ga840429
"- Hey, Garfield! Are you ready to go play golf?
-
- Aren't you coming? On second thought, I think I'd rather stay in the room and watch the sink back-up",ga840430
"- ODIE! GET AWAY FROM THAT TREE! GARFIELD! GET OUT OF THAT SAND TRAP!
- Would you mind observing proper golf etiquette there, mister?
- I'm sorry, but my pets are driving me nuts. It's the outfit I'm talking about.",ga840501
"- CRACK!
- Oh, no! I hit an old lady in the head and knocked her out cold!
- What should I do, Garfield? I'd straighten that left arm and turn that right hand over more.",ga840502
"-
- ROWR!
- GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THAT SAND TRAP? Squatting on a sandburg, thank you.",ga840503
"- Well, boys, it's been a nice vacation, but it's time to head home.
- Good heavens! What happened to you guys?!
- Odie discovered how to dial room service. Burp.",ga840504
"- Here we are! Home sweet home!
- ARRRGH!
- OKAY; WHO LEFT THE FAUCET RUNNING?! I didn't want my sponge collection to dry out.",ga840505
"-
- MY BED! ODIE'S SLEEPING IN MY BED!
- This calls for a good stomping!
- STOMP STOMP STOMP
-
-
- So much for my french bread and olive collection.",ga840506
"- Some people wonder why I hate mondays.
- Maybe I'm fatalistic.
- But I suspect I'm just stupid.",ga840507
"- scratch scratch scratch
- WHAM!
- I'm not very fond of Tuesday, either.",ga840508
"- I am absolutely not getting out of bed today.
- Hey, Garfield. There's a spider on your blanket.
- I keep forgetting we live in a generation without absolutes.",ga840509
"- I'll teach him to be a spider! STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP
- He won't have the guts to do that again.
- STOMP STOMP Better safe than sorry. STOMP STOMP STOMP",ga840510
"- Look at this.
- A cat stroking his owner!
- Why so affectionate, Garfield? I just squashed a spider.",ga840511
"-
- SLUG
- Big day.",ga840512
"-
- Fetch the stick, Odie!
-
-",ga840513
"- I'm lonely. I think I'll see if I can find Arlene.
- Hi there. You two-timing swine!
- What happened?",ga840514
"- Hi, Arlene. DON'T SPEAK TO ME, YOU CAD, I SAW YOU WITH THAT OTHER WOMAN!
- Oh come on now, do I look like the kind of guy who could easily attract women? I suppose you're right. And just what do you mean by that?",ga840515
"- Here is your dinner, my dear. BLAT
- Is this food fresh? Ha ha ha, why of course!
- This is only yesterday's newspaper.",ga840516
"- Aren't you going to join me for dinner, Garfield? Uh...no thank you. I'm on a diet.
- A diet?! How long have you been on a diet?
- Oh, for about 18 seconds now.",ga840517
"- Ho hum...
- Why do we see each other? It beats being lonely.
- I was hoping for something more romantic. That's way down the list.",ga840518
"-
- Is our date over? Did it begin?
- Some women don't appreciate us strong, silent types.",ga840519
"- tappity tappity tappity
- Good evening, folks. Here's a joke...what did the beaver say when he heard the chain saw?
- CHUKONG!
- Chirp Chirp They're playing my song.
- All of your mothers wear army boots.
- KONG CRASH! BAP!
- Why do you do it, Garfield? I loooove the attention.",ga840520
"- I hate Monday. That's the day people go back to work, kids go back to school...
-
- And diets begin.",ga840521
"- Garfield, you're too fat. I can't help it.
- I have a slow metabolism.
- A reeeeeeal slow metabolism.",ga840522
"- Do you know what I hate about diets?
- Eating is social.
- But when you diet, you diet alone.",ga840523
"- I think I have a way out of this diet.
- I know I'm too fat for a cat...
- But, I'm just right for a bumblebee!",ga840524
"- How goes the diet, Garfield?
- ROAR
- What was that?! That was my stomach, you twit.",ga840525
"-
- AYIEEEEE!
- Everyone's a critic. cough weeze",ga840526
"- *
- Oh no!
- I've tangle wit that dog before.
- If I take my eyes off him, he'll clobber me!
- I can't stand it.
- WHONGO!
- Why did you do that? I hit him back first.",ga840527
"- I hate mondays. Garfield, I don't know why you hate mondays so much.
- BLAT!
- SEE?!!!",ga840528
"- Good morning, Garfield.
- I made your coffee just like you like it.
- Strong.",ga840529
"- Oh shucks, I just spilled the only cup of coffee we have in the house.
-",ga840530
"- * ROWR *
- WHOCK!
- Garfield, where did the flowers come from? Well, why don't we just read the note?",ga840531
"- You like to scratch things, don't you, Garfield? Does a chicken like to peck? Sure I do!
- Good! Scratch my back.
- NO CLAWS! NO CLAWS! If I didn't use claws, I wouldn't be scratching, now would I?",ga840601
"- Scratch higher, Garfield.
- Higher!
- Get off the curtains, Garfield. I was just following instructions.",ga840602
"- grrrr
- RRRRRR Jon's best shoes!
- Sometimes Odie makes me so angry, I could just scream.
-
-
-
- ARRRRRGH!",ga840603
"- Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, uncle Roy.
- I love you just the way you are. I love you too, uncle Roy.
- I also love mondays. Stick it in your ear, uncle Roy.",ga840604
"- Good morning, boys and girls. I love you just the way you are. Everybody loves uncle Roy.
- You are kind, thoughtful, obedient and considerate.
- Not to mention intelligent, witty and charming. We all know uncle Roy is a liar, but we don't care.",ga840605
"- Here we are in a real factory, boys and girls. Let's see what we can learn...
- ARRRRRGH! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP!
- SHUT THIS **!* THING OFF. Uncle Roy is learning never to wear loose clothing around big machinery.",ga840606
"- Good morning, boys and girls. You are probably wondering where my dog, Bob, is this morning.
- Wellll...it seems old Bob bit Mr. Blue Jeans the mailman once too often...
- So Bob has decided to move to a local research facility to pursue a career as a laboratory animal. And I'm Frank Sinatra.",ga840607
"- Let's play pretend, boys and girls. Let's pretend it's contract negotiation time for uncle Roy...
- And there are big green monsters who want to take uncle Roy off the air...
- And the only thing that can save uncle Roy are letters saying how much you love uncle Roy. I hate to see a grown man grovel.",ga840608
"- Looks who's come to visit, boys and girls. It's Jerry the Cat. Hi, Jerry. Hi, uncle Roy.
- How are you? I'm fine, How are you? Uncle Roy is getting pretty bizarre.
- How's your mother? She's fine. Who'd be dumb enough to believe there is a talking cat?",ga840609
"- Hey, Jon, Look at this!
- Hey, Jon. Watch me!
- Jon doesn't pay any attention to me anymore. Watch this.
- Hey, Jon!
- Hey, Jon!
- Hey, Garfield? What, Jon?
- I don't pay any attention to me anymore.",ga840610
"-
-
- Don't you dare. I don't know what you're talking about.",ga840611
"- Every morning for nearly six years now, I fix raisin toast for Garfield.
- He loves his raisin toast.
- What's in the drawer? A six-year supply of raisins.",ga840612
"- * crack
- OH, YUK!
- It's not often you see a yolk with a beak.",ga840613
"- How would you like your bacon prepared, Garfield? Let's shoot for recognizable.
- Jon is a terrible cook. He could ruin cereal.
- Bacon flambe, yum yum.",ga840614
"- An interesting thing about food...
- One minute it may be haute cuisine.
- But the instant you put it into the sink, it becomes garbage.",ga840615
"- Here's your cereal, Garfield.
- What's the matter? Aren't you hungry? Not really.
- I think one of the flakes just moved.",ga840616
"-
- I'm going to kick Odie off this table.
- And he'll probably sprain something and have to go to the vet.
- And I'll get lonely without him.
- And Jon will be angry without me.
- And the humane society will want to lynch me.
- But nobody said life was a rose garden.",ga840617
"- I can't believe I turn six years old tomorrow. Some cats say, ""Life begins at six,"" but I don't buy that.
- Old age may take its toll on some cats, but it's not going to happen to me! I'm going to do something about it!
- Right after my nap.",ga840618
"- Happy birthday, Garfield! I got you a rubber chicken. They're lots of fun! We'll see about that.
- SMACK SPLUT
- Chicken, you and I are going to have some good times.",ga840619
"- You need a name, fella. Let's see...what do you name a rubber chicken?
- rrrrr
- ""Stretch""!",ga840620
"- peck peck peck
- SMACK!
- I'll have some ham and eggs, and my friend, Stretch, will have a bowl of rubber bands.",ga840621
"- peck peck peck
- STOP PECKING ME WITH THAT RUBBER CHICKEN!
- Aw, look, you just hurt Stretch's feelings. He brings out the worst in me.",ga840622
"- Pooky, I would like you to meet Stretch, my rubber chicken.
- Quite frankly, Pooky and Stretch don't have a lot of personality.
- But you have to trade off something when you surround yourself with good listeners.",ga840623
"-
- YAWN It's bed-bye time again.
- Tonight I think I'll take a deep breath, slowly close my eyes and savor the heavy feeling of sleep gradually overtaking my body. PAT! PAT! PAT!
- Then again it would be fun to have a cup of coffee and toss and turn for a couple of hours, then sleep till noon.
- Or maybe I'll run around the block, collapse into bed exhausted and fall asleep instantly.
- Or I could watch the all-night movies on TV until my eyelids get so heavy I couldn't possibly hold them open any longer.
- Sigh...so much sleeping to do and so few nights.",ga840624
"- Garfield, I think you're too mean to Odie.
- I never want to see you hit him again. Oh, very well.
- KONK!",ga840625
"- I'm going to the store, Garfield. If you lay a paw on Odie, I'll spank you.
-
- BOING",ga840626
"- Garfield, I swear you've done everything to Odie a cat could do to a dog. Au contraire.
- PLINK
- Never underestimate me.",ga840627
"- Hey, Odie! I found your nose!
- Let me put it on for you, pal. squik squik
- Very nice. I like you as a rat terrier.",ga840628
"- Well, well, well. I see you're eating my food, Odie. Now what are going to do with you?
- We are going to kick you into next week! That's what we're going to do! PUNT
- Where's Odie? Somewhere over saturday.",ga840629
"- Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food.
- I guess I 'll just have to make do.
- BLUT",ga840630
"-
- I believe you're gaining weight, Garfield. I believe your eyeballs are shrinking.
- Look at that soft belly. That's just water retention.
- Now why do you suppose you're looking larger? An optical illusion?
- The older you get', the bigger you get. Bigger-boned maybe.
- You're fat, Garfield. I am not fat!
- My center of gravity is just getting lower.",ga840701
"- I have this nagging feeling I'm forgetting something.
- WHUMP!
- Oh yes, I forgot I kicked Odie into next week, last week.",ga840702
"- Pooky loves me, I can tell.
- He doesn't talk, he doesn't walk, he doesn't think.
- a little nothing goes a long way.",ga840703
"- I'm working up a routine for the fence tonight, Pooky. Tell me what you think of it.
- I knew a teddy bear who was so ugly, even the tide wouldn't take it out.
- BLAT!",ga840704
"- Good evening, ladies and germs. I'd like you to meet Pooky, my gag writer.
- SPLAT
- Welcome to the show biz, kid.",ga840705
"- Jump through the hoop, Pooky.
- Hey, Garfield, what's happening? I'm pretending to teach Pooky tricks.",ga840706
"- Butterflies are versatile. They can caress the air.
- They can kiss the dew from the flowers.
- And they can embed themselves in radiators. FWAP!",ga840707
"- scritch scritch
- I'll be darned. These labels are loose.
- *
- It's the old ""Cats get the tuna while the owner get the cat food"" gag.
-
- Surprise, Garfield! I fixed us a tuna noodle casserole.
- Oh, well, I guess a half a surprise is better than none at all.",ga840708
"- Garfield, I know you hate mondays.
- But everything that could possibly happen to you has already happened.
- Au contraire, power failure breath.",ga840709
"- Since we can't watch TV during a power failure, Garfield, what say we listen to the radio?
- Ha ha! Do I feel stupid. That's because you ARE stupid. CLICK CLICK
- How about a game of cards? No, thanks. I'm just going to sit here and cry for a while.",ga840710
"- I've learned something from this power failure, Garfield.
- When you are deprived of your eyesight, isn't it amazing how much keener your other senses become?
- Huh?",ga840711
"- Don't worry, Garfield. The power failure may have spoiled the food in the refrigerator...
- But we still have lots of canned goods.
- Now where's our electric opener? ARRRGH!",ga840712
"- Hey, Garfield, as long as the power is off, we might as well go out.
- I have my bowling ball. Let's go bowling.
- Get your fingers out of my eyes and your thumb out of my mouth, and I'll consider it.",ga840713
"-
- Great! The power's back on! I can't think of anything worse than a power failure.
- How about two power failures?",ga840714
"- Z Z
- BABOOM!
- SHOOP ZOOM
- Allright you guys, get out of here. It's only a little thunderstorm.
- Pets...they're just like kids.
- CRACK KABOOM!
- Urf! Give me some room, will you? Hey! Your feet are cold!",ga840715
"- And now, a word from our sponsor.
- Hey, America. Here's a cat food we bet your cat will love.
- You're on.",ga840716
"- Good morning, old buddy.
- ARRRGH! That's only a piece of lint, Garfield.
- It sure does a great spider impression.",ga840717
"- BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Odie isn't really stupid. BONK
- He's just chased one too many parked cars.",ga840718
"- Okay, you turkeys, I'm prepared for anything.
- * AROOO *
- CRASH!",ga840719
"- Garfield, if you mess with my new fish, you'll regret it.
- What's so regrettable about a little seafood snack?
- Jon's going to pay for this.",ga840720
"-
- Well, well, Odie. I see you derive great pleasure from other's misfortune.
- So do I! SNAP!",ga840721
"-
- Garfield, where are yoooooou?
- Get out of the breadbox, Garfield!
- Get out from under the chair, Garfield!
- Garfield, you know I hate it when you hide from me!
- Oh, well. I'll find him sooner or later. There's only so many places a fat slob like him can hide.
- Get out of the bookcase, Garfield.",ga840722
"- You sleep too much, Garfield.
- Sometimes I do feel bad about sleeping so much.
- What with all the insomniacs in China.",ga840723
"- What Odie needs is a good kick.
- Uh-oh! Nap attack!
- I don't even want to know. Z",ga840724
"- Z
- Z SNORT! SNORT! Z",ga840725
"- Z
- Z Whimper
- No, Odie, Garfield isn't dead. He's just a hardcore sleeper.",ga840726
"- Are you going to sleep all day, Garfield? Let me check my social calendar.
- Let's see...there's high tea with the Queen of England tomorrow, but nothing today.
- Z Ask a stupid question...",ga840727
"- YAWN What a great night's sleep!
- I'm ready to attack a fresh new day.
- Good evening, Garfield. What's on the late movie?",ga840728
"- Good morning, Garfield. I'm hungry.
- How would you like your egg prepared? I would like it hatched.
- Raise it to young chickenhood on a diet of cracked corn, barley and sorghum molasses.
- Then barbecue the dude. I should think a steak sauce and honey glaze would be nice.
-
- Scrambled? Scrambled.",ga840729
"- There's only one way to beat the heat today.
- Where are you going, Garfield? To the beach.
- Hello, beach.",ga840730
"- There's only one thing I hate about the beach.
- PONK!
- It's always so crowded.",ga840731
"- GREAT!
-
- Surf's up!",ga840801
"- Garfield, I know you like to have fun...
- But you look ridiculous.
- Stand aside there, fella. Here comes my next wave.",ga840802
"- Okay, everyone out of the pool! I'm going swimming.
- You! the one with the whistle-out!
- I don't need a lifeguard.",ga840803
"- *
- Rats.
- I thought you were going swimming. The water was polluted.",ga840804
"- Hello, what have we here?
- I think I'll draw something.
- Hey, Garfield! This is a great drawing! Do you know what his means?!
- A cat who can draw! We'll make millions. You'll be famous!
- We'll tour the world! Live out a suitcase! You'll do thousands of drawings!
- SLASH!
- Why did you do that? Suddenly, life got too complicated.",ga840805
"- NO! NO! NO! DON'T MAKE ME DO IT!
- ARRRGH! SOMEONE HELP ME!
- Sometimes it's hard to fight primal instincts.",ga840806
"- Hello, lunch.
-
- Those bird's nets are deceptively large.",ga840807
"- Why do I do it? Why do I climb up trees when I can't climb down?
- The neighborhood always turns out to see me. Then the fire department comes to get me. Then my picture ends up in the newspaper.
- I just answered my own question.",ga840808
"- Oh good! Here comes a fireman to save me!
- Terrific. Why do I always get the fat ones?
- And the ones who are sensitive about their weight?",ga840809
"- I'm getting sleepy.
- If birds can sleep in trees, so can I.
- Z",ga840810
"- If I truly believe I'm a bird, I might be able to flap my arms and fly out of this tree.
- I'm a bird! I'm a bird!
- I hope birds' bones knit quickly.",ga840811
"- Ballet slippers? Uh-oh, Jon's getting weird on me.
- See the ballet slippers I'm giving my niece, Garfield? I wish I had ballet slippers.
- I'll let this niece has never been on pointe.
- Or done a jete.
- Or a pirouette.
- POW!
- What happened? I had a ballet slipper blow out on a bourree.",ga840812
"-
- WHAP!
- Sometime, somewhere, when you are least expecting it...Monday strikes.",ga840813
"- What's wrong with this picture?
- There's no food in your bowl, Garfield. Give the man a cigar! Fill it up, turkey.
- I hate it when lower life forms are condescending to me.",ga840814
"- I've been taken! There was only one kernel of popcorn in this whole bag.
- Oh, well, one's better than nothing.
- POP!",ga840815
"- Good morning, fern. How about a drink of water, little friend?
- How nice, Garfield, I'm glad to see you take an interest in my fern.
- I'm fattening it for slaughter.",ga840816
"- Where is it written that humans must give cats milk in saucers?! Why not in cups or bowls or pans?
- SPLASH
- SEE?! I think Garfield is trying to tell me something.",ga840817
"- What is it, Garfield?
- Pick me up. Too fat to hop on the table, huh?
- One of these days, I'll learn.",ga840818
"-
-
- SCRIK
- SLUCK
- SHLONK
- TUCK
- I love rubber pets.",ga840819

- The caped avenger returns.",ga840820
"- Uh-oh.
- RUN FOR COVER, ODIE!
- Make way for the caped avenger.
- Garfield is fantasizing again.",ga840821
"- The caped avenger seeks out evil wherever it may lurk.
-
- As long as it isn't in dark scary places.",ga840822
"- The caped avenger will now descend upon an old archenemy.
- BLAT!
- The caped avenger forgot to correct for crosswind.",ga840823
"- Be careful, mere mortal man! That food may be poisoned! The caped avenger will taste it for you.

"- Hmmm.
- This ladder gives me a great idea.

- And blow Jon's mind.
- This is going to be fun.
- Unless, of course, Jon doesn't see me.
- Unless, of course, Jon goes to bed.",ga840826
"- Guess what, Garfield! We're going to the farm this week.

"- Dad! Mom!
- Jon Boy! Jonny!
- I wish they'd call me by my real name. You're right, dummy.",ga840828

- What's with him, dad? Ever since he started wearing long pants, he's hated the be called ""Boy"".
- How long has that been? Since last thursday. A late bloomer.",ga840829
"- I know we're brothers, Doc Boy, but do you think we've grown apart since I moved to the city? Don't call me Doc Boy.
- How would you like it if I called you a city slicker? I wouldn't like that.
- DOC BOY! DOC BOY! DOC BOY! SLICKER! SLICKER! SLICKER! Boys! Boys! Boys!",ga840830
"- Well, Garfield, this week you learned where bacon comes from. Bacon comes from a pig.
- And you learned where milk comes from. Milk comes from the udder of a cow.
- Would you like to know where eggs come from? I would as soon that remain a mystery.",ga840831
"- Do you know what worries me, Garfield?
- My grandfather was bald, my dad is bald and my brother is balding. Not to worry.
- You are probably adopted.",ga840901
"- Garfield, when we get to the campsite, what's the first thing you'd like to do? Go home.
- Here we are, boys. We're camping miles from nowhere. I'd say we're closer than that.
- CLICK
- Oh no! Odie locked himself in the car! The poor little guy could suffocate! I think I'm starting to enjoy camping.
- Unlock the door, boy. Unlock the door. Breathe deeply, boy.
- Something just occurred to me. Could it be...? Could it be, Odie isn't as stupid as he looks?",ga840902
"- Pwoooock, pwock, pwock, pwock.
-
- Don't look, Stretch! It's not a pretty sight!",ga840903
"- Pwoooock, pwock, pwock, pwock.
- PUKUCK! PUKUCK! PUKUCK!

"- Garfield, do you know how silly you look carrying that stupid rubber chicken around all the time?
- FFFFF
- Uh-oh, fella. Now you did it. You made Stretch mad.",ga840905
"- Are you in there, Garfield?
- There ain't nobody here but us chickens.
- I WILL NOT SPEAK TO YOUR RUBBER CHICKEN! Think of Stretch as my social secretary.",ga840906
"- Here, Stretch, have an apple.
-
- STOMP! POO! DONG!",ga840907
"- Okay, guys, get on your mark, get st, go!

- Competition is apparently not a driving force in their lives.",ga840908
"- Hello, I'm Nermal, the... ""The world's cutest kitten."" I know, I know.
- Why, hello, Nermal. Aren't you cute.
- I want some attention, too. BONK
- Aw, poor little guy!
- Well, two can play the sympathy game.
- CRASH!
- That was one of my best plates. That was one of my best heads.",ga840909
"- I love your purr, Garfield. Purrr
- I wish there were a way to get the purr without the cat. Purrr
- But I guess you have to take the bad with the good. You're treading on thin ice, fella.",ga840910
"- Ready for a gourmet meal, Garfield?
- WHAM!
- I hate spiders.",ga840911
"- One nice thing about confiding in pets is that they are non-judgmental.
- Garfield, I got a speeding ticket today.
- SMACK! That was a stupid thing to do.",ga840912
"-
- Why, thank you, Garfield!
- PSHHH",ga840913
"- Hee, hee, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
- WHIRRRRR! How prophetic.",ga840914
"- Rats, Garfield fell asleep in the middle of the door.
- Have you ever tried to pick up a sleeping cat?
- It's impossible.",ga840915
"- *
- Good morning, Garfield. Good morning, Jon. My rubber chicken, Stretch, needs a bath too.
- SPLOOSH!
- Sign here for this package, mister.

"-
-
- It's diet time, Garfield. I was afraid of that.",ga840917
"- In order to properly diet, you must change your eating habits, Garfield.
- You must look at food differently.
- Ha ha ha, Garfield.",ga840918
"- Let's measure your tummy, Garfield.
- When you take four inches of your waist, you may go off your diet.
- And that doesn't count.",ga840919
"- You may have coffee on your diet, Garfield.
- Thank goodness.
- This diet isn't going to be as bad as I thought.",ga840920
"- For once in my life, a diet worked.
- I'm going to treat myself to a potato chip.
- poomp! Rats.",ga840921
"-
- Let's see how I did on my diet this week. Whimper. Oh, shut up.",ga840922
"- Good morning, sunshine, poke poke poke
- Hey, Garfield, what's all this junk in your bed?
- This isn't junk, this is my stuff.
- I use this brass lizard to scratch my back.
- And here is some extra cat hair for your food, and a double corncob that is a family heirloom.
- And this is my bean-filled whack-bonk. What does that do?
- WHACK! BONK",ga840923
"- It's Monday morning. A cold. gray, dizzy Monday morning.
- Some dude with a trumpet is wailin' some blues on the radio and my breakfast is cold. * *
- It's all so perfectly depressing I can't wipe this smile off my face. *",ga840924
"- Hold it right there. I always want to remember you like this.

- Pooky and I are having lunch. We do everything together. I swear.
- You cats have the strangest habits.",ga840928
"- Oh, come on, Garfield. The cat food isn't that bad.
- Then let's see how YOU like it!
- mmm good. YOU LIE!",ga840929
"-
-
-
-
-
-
- I thought fat people were jolly.",ga840930
"- Look at all those poor saps trudging to work on a Monday morning.
- Ha ha ha, you poor saps, you have to go to work and I don't 'cause I'm a cat!
- If I weren't me, I wouldn't like me very much.",ga841001
"- It's a real rat race out there.
- Everybody striving to get ahead.
- I think I'll go take a nap and fall off the pace.",ga841002
"-
- SUCK
- He's so lazy, I could just cry. Burp",ga841003
"- I got you something special, Garfield.
- It's too light for food, and you can't wrap sleep.
- It can't be THAT special.",ga841004
"- Good night, Garfield.
- *CLICK* Don't let the thing in the closet get you.
- Don't do that to me!",ga841005
"- I think I'll try a two-and-a-half nap attack in the pike position with a half twist.
-
- I'll settle for a belly-flop. Z",ga841006
"-
-
-
-
- HEY, HUBERT! REBA! COME HERE, QUICK!
- Play cowboy and horsy, boys. Do a handstand, Garfield. Balance on Garfield, Odie. Sad. He should get out of the house more.",ga841007
"- This feels like a great day to spend in bed.
- Hop up, Garfield. We're gooing on a picnic! Give the bugs and snakes my regrets. I ain't going.
- I'll get you for this, Monday!",ga841008
"- What's this? I packed the microwave for our picnic.
- Well, I'm leaving it here.
- WHA...! If the television stays, I stay.",ga841009
"- Wait 'til you taste my cherry pie, Garfield. It's the world's best.
- I agree.
- 22 million ants can't all be wrong.",ga841010
"- The picnic's all set, Garfield.
- Did I forget anything?
- You forgot the brick for the tablecloth.",ga841011
"- That pesky wind won't spoil our picnic now, Garfield.
- Where's the mustard?
- Under the third rock from the left.",ga841012
"- Well, Garfield, the ants ate my cherry pie. The wind blew the food everywhere. DON'T SAY IT! DON'T SAY IT!
- What else could possibly go wrong?
- You said it!",ga841013
"- MUNCH SLURP SMACK GULP
- Burp. Oh, boy, I ate too much pizza. Z
- SHUFFLE SHUFFLE SHUFFLE

-
- And who are you? I'm the matto ball you ate three weeks ago.",ga841014
"- Good morning, folks! My oh my, it's a beautiful Monday morning out there.
- Our weather radar shows clear skies with no rain in sight.
- Except over one house in the suburbs.",ga841015
"- Our satellite picture shows clouds over the northeast, sunny skies in the southwest...
- Traffic backed up on 12th street...
- And my little niece, Sally, playing in her sandbox i Texas. Kind of scary, isn't it?",ga841016
"- Wuth.
- You can always tell when Odie has been eating out of the refrigerator.
- He gets his tongue stuck in the ice cube trax. Wuth.",ga841017
"- GULP MUNCH SLURP
- Why do you eat so much, Garfield?
- In a former life I was a sanitary landfill.",ga841018
"- Clouds are so interesting. I love to find shapes in them.
- There's a chicken cloud, and a hamburger cloud, and a bicycle cloud.
- And I do believe that one's a rain cloud.",ga841019
"- What do you think of my new frame, Garfield?
- ARRRGH!
- Thank heavens! For a moment I thought it was a mirror.",ga841020
"-
-
- PUCUCK!
- ONE MORE STUNT LIKE THAT AND I'M GOING TO WRING YOUR RUBBER CHICKEN'S NECK!
-
- I'm sorry I snapped at you, Garfield? Will you forgive me? I forgive you.
- SMACK! WHAP! But Stretch doesn't!",ga841021
"- Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me.
- Hey, Arlene, what's my most outstanding feature? You're fat.
- Did you hear that? She admires me for my body.",ga841022
"- Do you love me more than you love food, Garfield?
- Do chickens have lips?
- No. Bingo.",ga841023
"- Aren't you ashamed of that space between your teeth? Of course not!
- It's a sign of sensitivity.
- I'd be sensitive about it too. I don't know what I see in him.",ga841024
"- Don't you just love sunrise, Garfield? The chirping of the birds...the crisp morning air.
- The sound of bacon sizzling in the skillet...the smell of fresh brewed coffee.
- I get the feeling we're watching two different channels.",ga841025
"- Why do you like bachelorhood, Garfield? I can sum it up in a word...
- ""uncomplicated""
- That sounds simple. Simple, that's me.",ga841026
"- What is love to you, Garfield? Love is that exhilarating feeling you get when a vision of beauty comes walking to you.
- In fact, I just had that experience. When you saw me?
- When I saw my mirror this morning.",ga841027
"-
-
-
- POO!
-
- KONK!
- The harder you work for something, the more you appreciate it.",ga841028
"- Garfield, there's a mouse in the house, and I'm just sick about it.
- It chewed the toe out of my sock.
- I want you to catch it and kill it. Now I'M sick about it.",ga841029
"- Good morning, mouse. Good morning, cat.
- Make yourself at home. Gladly.
- But first, some house rules.",ga841030
"- Hey, cat, gimme a drumstick. Sure.
- Enjoy.",ga841031
"- What's your name, mouse? OK, gee. I don't think I have a name.
- Oh, come on, what do people say when they meet you?
- My name is Eek!",ga841101
"- We gotta give you a name, mouse.
- How about Crusher? How about Bruiser? How about Cat killer?
- How about Squeak? I like it.",ga841102
"- Here, Squeak, let me strap this key to your back. What's this for?
- I don't remember buying you a toy mouse, Garfield.
- Got the picture? You're a genius!",ga841103
"-
- A dimly lit street corner at midnight. This puts me in the mood for some snappy patter.
- Hey, good-lookin!. What's happening? Who are you?
- Names aren't important. Some call me a soldier of fortune, some call me a renaissance man. You can call me ""Major"". I love men in uniform.
- What say we go to Rick's Cafe Americain for a soda pop? I'm with you, big boy.
- Here's lookin' at you, sweetheart. SMACK! Rats. I think I chucked her chin a little hard.",ga841104
"- Hide! Here comes my owner!
- Why are we hiding? Jon wants me to eat you and I don't want to.
- You're so nice! Thanks for thinking of me. I was thinking of me.",ga841105
"- Okay, Squeak, here's the game plan. Every now and then, you show up in front of Jon and dance around until I appear on the scene and chase you away.
- In return, you get a nice home to live in, and I get to keep my job.
- This is a strange world we live in. You gotta play by the rules.",ga841106
"- Here's your cat food, Garfield.
- A MOUSE!
- That must be the surprise at the bottom of the box.",ga841107
"- Hey, Squeak, I found a great place for you to live!
- Jon will never think to look for you in this old log cabin.
- Nice, huh? Is it in a good school system?",ga841108
"- Thanks for the house, Garfield. A man needs a place to call his own. This is great! Don't mention it, kid.
-",ga841109
"- Listen carefully, Squeak. This is a mousetrap. Never, NEVER touch the tab in the center of it.
- You mean, this little tab here?
- This boy does not take direction well. Hey! That hurt!",ga841110
"-
-
- WAH HA HA HA!
- What a great sundae! Nothing can spoil my day.

- HEY, FLEABAG! COME HERE! Then again: ""Garfield"" does have a certain ring on it.",ga841112
"- OH NO! A FLEA! I'M GETTING YOU A FLEA COLLAR, GARFIELD. Let's not be too hasty here.
- Look at those distinctive yellow and green markings there.
- This flea is a member of a rare species of vegetarians.",ga841113
"- Well, there's your new flea collar, Garfield.
- Wait a minute, there's a disclaimer on this box. ""Warning: while this collar will repel fleas...""
- ""It has been known to attract sharks.""",ga841114
"- DON'T TAKE THAT FLEA COLLAR OFF, GARFIELD! Who needs it?
-",ga841115
"- You have a pretty grim flea problem there, Odie.
- That's not a very strong flea collar.",ga841116
"- Did I ever tell you about my crazy uncle Berle? He thought he was a dog.
- The poor guy was always exhausted.
- He kept chasing himself up trees.",ga841117
"- Can we talk?
- I would like to speak to you about how wonderful cats are.
- Unlike dogs, they always land on their feet.
- They are more calm than dogs. ROWR!
- Every movement is a deliberate statement of grace and beauty.
- And when it comes to coordination, they are far superior to dogs. WHAP!
- BARK ! BARK!",ga841118
"- Doc Boy! How's my favorite little brother?
- Oh, things are pretty much the same here, wild parties, good times, the usual...
- Uh, you say you're coming to visit? It's put up or shut up time.",ga841119
"- What am I going to do, Garfield? My brother is coming to visit from the farm.
- He thinks I live life in the fast lane. ""Life in the parking lot"" is more like it.
- I don't know where he got the idea. It was when you told him you were negotiating movie rights to your diary.",ga841120
"- There's my brother now. * DING DONG
- Welcome to the big city, doc Boy! Let the good times roll!
- Another soda pop? No, I think I'll have some more of that fun-filled popcorn. I'm going to like Doc Boy.",ga841121
"- I'm so embarrassed. Doc Boy comes all the way from the farm just to find out what a loser I am. The truth always hurts.
- Hey, where are all those ""good times"" you promised me? What would you like to do?
- Let's go to the airport and watch the airplanes land. Whatever you say, wild man! Jon just got off the hook.",ga841122
"- Oh, by the way, Doc Boy, I've fixed us up on a double date. HEY, GREAT!
- What's a double date? That's when you and I go on a date together.
- Gee, it seems like it would be more fun if some girls came along. There's no hope.",ga841123
"- DOC BOY! OUR DATES ARE HERE!
- EEEEEEK!
- Can we talk? Can we laugh?",ga841124

- If I can't sleep, neither will anyone else.",ga841125
"- I wonder who that could be, Doc Boy. DING DONG . Dad! Mom! What are you doing here!? We missed you boys, okay?
- A little paint, a few curtains, a woman's touch, this could be nice! My dad, the sentimental fool. My mom, the cliche.",ga841126
"- Your visit is such a surprise, mom. When's the last time you and dad went out? We haven't been off the farm since '53. I don't believe that.
- Good heavens! What's this? That's an indoor toilet, dad.
- WOO-HA! AIN'T SCIENCE SOMETHIN'? FLUSH NOW I believe it.",ga841127
"-
- You awake, Jon? click OF COURSE NOT, DAD! IT'S 5 A.M.! WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
- I GOTTA MILK SOMETHING! I'm leaving.",ga841128
"- You forgot this when you left home, Doc Boy. Thanks, mom, I haven't slept a wink without it.
- Whatcha got there, Doc Boy? NOTHING! NOTHING! IT'S NOTHING!
- Could it be a shred of your old blankie? Careful what you say about blankies, fella.",ga841129
"- Uh, mom...I wouldn't open that if I were you.
- EEEK!
- SOMETHING IN THERE MOVED! I'm sure it was just an optical illusion. GO ahead, tell her how the lunch meat has evolved into an intelligent life form.",ga841130
"- So long, son. We got a run. I miss my cows. Give them my best.
- SEE YUH, DOC BOY! THANKS FOR DECORATING MY HOUSE, MOM!

- Sorry, Odie. You can't go.
- Garfield, YOU are a pet. snap! Rats! I keep forgetting.",ga841203
"- I'm leaving for the cartoonists' convention now, Garfield. There's a week's worth of food for you. A week's worth, huh?
-
- It was more like 11 seconds' worth.",ga841204
"- I hope Jon comes back from that convention soon.
- I hope I can survive this week on my own.
- CLICK I hope this door isn't locked.",ga841205
"- What a tragic scenario...""Owner leaves for week...cat locks self out of house...cat starves in front porch"".
- Hey, wait a minute? I control my destiny! I don't have to starve on the front porch!
- ""Cat starves in bushes"".",ga841206
"- As long as I'm locked out of the house, I guess I'll strike out in search of food.
- Gee, this neighborhood doesn't look familiar to me.
- Oh, no! Where am I?",ga841207
"- I gotta figure a way to meet some chicks.
- You got a problem there, guy?
- Striking manly poses doesn't seem to be doing it.",ga841208
"- *
- *
- Rats! There's an alley full of mean guys waiting to beat me up!
- Maybe they won't hurt me if I look mean, too.
- Hey! It's working!
-
- Someday, I'm going to learn precisely where that fine line is, and I'm never going to cross it again!",ga841209
"- Garfield! I'm back from the convention! Where are you, big guy? ...Garfield?
- Oh, no! This is terrible! Garfield didn't get locked out or anything, did he, Odie?
- Yup.",ga841210
"- Hello, Garfield. Do I know you?
- Let me give you a hint...sit up straight, Don't talk with your mouth full. Wake up, sleepyhead.
- MOM!",ga841211
"- It's great seeing you again, mom. Yes, it's been a while.
- It seems like only yesterday.
- This was your first bed. It HAS been a while.",ga841212
"- Mom, I don't recognize this place. I thought I was born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant. It closed years ago, darling.
- It's all gone! Where's the pasta? The people? The pasta? The excitement? The pasta?
- You always did love to eat. Sniff...old habits are hard to break.",ga841213
"- Father, this is your grandson, Garfield. He will be staying with us for a while.
- If you're going to stay here, boy, you're going to be a mouser like the rest of us.
- So this is my grandson and you son, huh? Maybe they switched kittens in the maternity ward.",ga841214
"- If I have to be a mouser to stay here, grandpa, I'll do it! I have made a name for myself in the mousing game.
- Then eat that mouse. ARRRGH!!! Please! Please don't make me eat it!
- I'd rather swallow my pride than that mouse.",ga841215
"- RRRRR Okay, okay. Let's get something to eat.
-
- No cats allowed!

-
- I've been human for 10 minutes now, but I haven't forgotten my roots.",ga841216
"- Gee, I miss having Garfield around. I even miss the abuse.
- RRR!
- Thanks, Odie, but it just isn't the same.",ga841217
"- I'd love to catch your mice, grandpa, But I haven't seen any worthy of my time, got anything bigger? Bring on the training mouse!
-
- Me and my big mouth.",ga841218
"- I'm sorry I can't stay, mom. It's for the best, dear. You'd better hurry home. It's almost Christmas.
- Christmas! I almost forgot!
- I also forgot I'm lost.",ga841219
"- Well, this is just great. I'm cold, I'm hungry, I'm tired...
- It's snowing to beat the band, and I haven't the foggiest idea where I am.
- While everyone else is having a white Christmas, I'm going to have a white lost.",ga841220
"- I'm cold, I'm hungry and I'm tired.
- They say, in cases like this, you should fight sleep.
- I say, why fight an old friend?",ga841221
"- Garfield! Wake up! You're near home!
- Huh? Mom? Wha...?!
- Wow...it never looked better.",ga841222
"-

- Actually, yes. I just thought it would be more dramatic this way.",ga841223

- What is it, Garfield? Read my lips. I'm hungry!",ga841224
"- MERRY CHRISTMAS, BOYS.
- There's nothing like having the whole family together at Christmas, right?",ga841225
"- Hey, Garfield, a late Christmas package arrived for you from my mom. OH NO!
- Why, it's your annual Christmas sweater! I'll bet you thought she forgot. There was always the hope.
- You should send her a ""thank you"" now. I'll get a letter bomb out immediately.",ga841226
"- I'll give you 10 zillion dollars for that cup of coffee.
- There you go again! Every, I say, EVERY MORNING you steal my coffee. GUSH
- Aw, isn't that sweet? Our little ritual.",ga841227
"- Why is it my coffee cups keep disappearing?
-
- AHA! I must have a word with the maid.",ga841228
"- When you own pets, you get hardened to the fact they will be around your food.
- Lose something, Garfield? Nope, here's my stripe.",ga841229
"- It's that time of year again.
- This year I resolve to lose weight, exercise more and sleep less.
-
- Then what are you going to do after you've accomplished all that?
- I suppose you're going to be nice to Odie and kowtow to Jon and lick the mailman's boots!
- I DON'T LIKE YOU ALREADY.
- Once again I've survived a new year with my vices intact.",ga841230
"- Hey, Garfield, get up. A new year is almost upon us! Great! Wake me next year.
- Come on. I'm having a party tonight and I want you to be there. If you insist.",ga841231
"- That was some new year's celebration last night, wasn't it, Garfield? Did anyone get the license number of the party that hit me?
- Are you going to get up today? No way! I got up yesterday and look what happened to me!
- Not feeling well, huh? It would take two of me to feel worse.",ga850101
"- I don't mind grocery shopping.
- And I don't mind carrying them home.
- This is the part I dread.",ga850102
"- As long as you're in the way, why don't you find a place to put these groceries.
- GOBBLE! GOBBLE! GOBBLE!
- I wanted you to put them in the pantry! Urp...that can be arranged.",ga850103

"- We fat people get a lot more out of life. We eat big. We drink big, we laugh big.
- HAR! HAR! HAR!
- Are you okay, Garfield? You wouldn't understand, skinny person.",ga850108
"- Being skinny isn't always a bed of roses.
- It must be tough wearing suspenders to hold your socks up.
- I knew a guy who was so skinny, he had to step on the scales twice to weight himself!",ga850109
"- I think skinny people are funny...
- Their pants keep falling down. thump thump thump
- I knew a kid who was so skinny, all he could wear was a hat!",ga850110

- You'll regret it tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes!
- FLIP I'd be thinner if my conscience were quicker-witted.",ga850111
"- Fat people are healthier than skinny people in many ways...
- For instance, no fat person has ever been diagnosed as having vatorphobia.
- That, of course, is the fear of starving to death in a stuck elevator.",ga850112
"- This is my lucky day.

- Wha...? SCRIIICK POOF!

- OH YUK! How disgusting! There's a people hair in my cat food!",ga850116

- Oh yeah? And what dimension is that?
- YOUTH!",ga850129
"- Nermal, you're cute, but you're not very bright. Doesn't that bother you?
- Oh no.
- I figure I'll grow out of this cute stage sooner or later. I rest my case.",ga850130
"- Nermal, would you rather have your good looks or my intellect?
- My good looks.
- I have years and years to get your intellect. That hurt.",ga850131
"- Nermal, would you like to be like me when you grow up?
- Gosh yes! I'd like to be like you when I grow up.
- And up, and up, and out, and out, and up. That boy may not see his next birthday.",ga850201

- It's snowing! Let's go out and catch snowflakes on our tongues!

- WHA?!
- You're everywhere at once! How do you do that? Magic.
- AMAZING! Thanks, guys.",ga850210
"- Can't you close your mouth to eat? You're hard to look at.
- You mean, this bothers you? Yuk!
- I see no humor in that, Garfield. Then why am I chortling?",ga850211
"- A house becomes a home once it's well established with cat hair.
- Oh no! This is not a cat hair! It's a whisker!
- I'm going bald!",ga850212
"- You're shedding again. What am I supposed to do with all this cat hair? Knit the world's largest hairball.
- Trade it with your friends, start a mustache factory.
- This is going nowhere. Insulate your house! Filter your coffee!",ga850213
"- Did you know there are three kinds of cat hair? There's the common, way to clean kind...
- There's the kind that disappears into the carpet, never to be seen again. And then there's my favorite...
- There's the kind that hangs in the air forever. LAND! DARN IT! LAND!",ga850214
"- Well, I've swept under the furniture, vacuumed my chair and shaken the rugs. I'm finally rid of all your cat hair.
-
- Fortunately, I keep an emergency supply in the back of my bed.",ga850215
"- You boys sure shed a lot.
- Wha?! SHOOP!
- The cat hair refuses to associate with the dog hair. sniff..",ga850216
"- DINNER TIME, GARFIELD!

- WHOAAA!
- Enjoying your cat food, Garfield? We must have it more often.",ga850217
"- WHIRRR!
- FWUMP! WHAT WAS THAT?!
- Hi, Squeak! Get me out of here!",ga850218
"- How are you, Squeak? How would you feel if you got sucked up in a vacuum cleaner?
- How humiliating! Me, a mouse, sucked up like a common piece of dirt. That's just my luck! What are the chances of that ever happening?
- whirrrr SHOOP! Getting better all the time, I'd say.",ga850219
"- Hey, Garfield, I'm missing a slipper, two spools of thread and a button...
- You don't know where they are, would you? I think I do...
- May I have a word with you, Squeak? Vroom! Vroom!",ga850220
"- Why are people afraid of mice? Bad press, I guess.
- Maybe it's because mice carried the black plague in 1348. I don't know what you're talking about.
- As I recall, half of Europe died.
- Picky, picky, picky.",ga850221
"- Would you look at that mousetrap?! Barbaric, isn't it.
- You said it! A nice camembert or creamy brie would be worth going in after.
- BUT THAT PROCESSED AMERICAN CHEESE IS AN INSULT TO MY PALATE! Precisely what I was saying.",ga850222
"- You're lazy, Garfield. Lazy, do you hear me? If you had any ambition, you could be anything you want.
- Like the world's greatest mouser?
- Lazy, I admire that in a cat.",ga850223
"-
- Hmmm

- Uhhh...candy gram? You can't fool me, mystery meat. You want out to wreak havoc.
- Today the refrigerator, tomorrow the world!",ga850301

"- OH NO!
- GARFIELD! YOU'RE SITTING IN MY SCRAMBLED EGGS! They're warm.
- Okay, okay, here...enjoy.

"- It's time for your checkup, Garfield. I'll get checked-up while the lady vet gets checked out.

"- Good morning, Mr. Arbuckle.
- How did you know it was me? I wasn't even in the door yet! you have a distinctive cologne.
- Oh, you mean my ''Ode De Lumberjack""? Bingo.",ga850305
"- How about a date, doc? Oh, let's not and say we did.
- That's better than nothing, I guess.
- Can we say I kissed you good night? If we can say I slapped you.",ga850306
"- Let's be honest with one another, Liz.
- I'm a man. You're a woman. Get the picture?
- That's the door. Get the picture? You'll have to draw it for him, doc.",ga850307
"- Do you think these shaders make me more mysterious? YOU don't need them.
- Hey, good-lookin', what time do you get off work?
- You just propositioned my coat rack. He might get lucky this time.",ga850308
"- In case you're thinking about asking me out, doc, forget it. I have plans.
- I'm seeing this girl, ho is real cute and real clever and we laugh a lot. Do tell...
- My, my, my! Do I detect a note of jealousy in your voice? I walked into that one?",ga850309
"- Sigh.
- Garfield, you are worthless. Do you know that?
- You are doing zero with your life...zip. Do you know that? poke poke
- You should learn something new each day. It would lend purpose to this dreary existence of yours.
- I'm going to the store. When I come back, I want you to have learned something.
- I'm home, Garfield. Did you learn anything?
- I learned how to use your credit card.",ga850310

- Here y'are, hon. Thanks, Irma.
-
- Uh, Irma.
- Don't mind me, hon.
- I think I lost a false eyelash in here somewhere.
- Sardi's this ain't.",ga850526
"- I think I'll exercise.
- I'd better start slowly.

- And take your pogo stick with you!",ga850528
"- Let's talk about the responsibilities an owner assumes when he obtains a cat. The first responsibility is to feed that cat.
- LATER!
- I guess we'll wait to discuss the second responsibility when we're in a little better mood.",ga850529
"- Hey, Garfield, here's an article about a guy who thought he could fly by wearing a cape and jumping off a building.
- They scraped him off Fifth Avenue with a putty knife. I guess he learned his lesson.
- Yeah, he didn't believe.",ga850530
"- Good morning, Job. Hmmph
- SMACK! BLUT!
- I'm feeling good about today so don't burst my bubble, okay?",ga850531
"- Oh goody! Jon's home!
-
- When Mr. Excitement steps into the room, you can cut the apathy with a knife.",ga850601
"- Hmmm
- All cats are innately curious. I was just wondering where rainwater goes.
- WHOA!
-
- Gasp!
- So this is where rainwater goes! Interesting!
- So this is where dishwater goes! Fascinating. So this is where bathwater goes! That's the last time I drink out of the toilet.",ga850602
"- Good morning, Garfield. Mmmph.
- What was that? Mmmph.
- I can't understand you. I ate all the ice cream and my mouth went numb, okay?",ga850603
"- Sniff
- Remember, as you walk down the path of life...
- Stop and eat the flowers along the way.",ga850604
"- What's the difference between flowers and weeds?

- Weeds have a greater will to live.",ga850605
"-
- Hey, Jon!
- When was the last time you swept under the bed?",ga850606
"- Surprise, Garfield!
- I picked up lunch at grease world!
- Junk food is the staff of life.",ga850607

- Look at Jon's socks, they are all perfectly tucked and organized.
- Okay, socks, line up! Count off!
- FORWARD HARCH! ONE! TWO! THREE! FOURP!
- Stay away from my sock drawer, Garfield. You make me nervous.
-
- As you were.",ga850609
"-
-
- Clear your head, Jon. There has to be a logical explanation for this, other than the teddy bear isn't housebroken.",ga850610
"- Pick up your stuff, Garfield. STUFF?! Pooky isn't STUFF! He's a real, live, feeling, breathing...
- Uh...inanimate object.",ga850611
"- That sun is pretty strong today, Pooky. A guy could burn if he's not careful.
-",ga850612
"- Do you know why I love Pooky?
- It is said we were given two ears and only one mouth so that we can tell only half of what we hear...
- Pooky has two ears and no mouth.",ga850613
"- So, this is the bedtime story you want to hear, huh?
- ""Bangor the Enforcer screamed, 'The world is ours!' at that very moment teddy bears everywhere crawled out of their toy chests and armed themselves"".
- This is a side of teddy bears I'd as soon not know.",ga850614
"- And then about April of '81 or was it '82, my voice changed and I started singing the baritone part.
- Gee, Pooky. I'm tired of talking about me...
- YOU talk about me for a while.",ga850615
"- Persons At Work
- How fortuitous, someone was kind enough to dig this hole for me.
- I'll cover it with these branches and play a little trick on Odie.
- Hey, Odie, have a bone.
- BOING!
- Something's not right here.
- OH NO! IT'S THE OLD RUBBER HOLE GAG!",ga850616
"- This sun is enough to bake your brains.
-
- That, of course, doesn't affect Odie.",ga850617
"- It must be a zillion degrees out there, Garfield.
- Let's turn on the radio and find out what the temperature is.
- You mean this radio?",ga850618
"-
- SURPRISE!
- Happy birthday, Garfield! I had a feeling this was coming.",ga850619
"- Observe, beating the heat is simply a matter of mind over body.
- I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm cold.
- Unfortunately, my body has a mind of its own.",ga850620

"- Have some lemonade, Garfield.
- GUSH!
- Refreshed? Yo.",ga850622

- Z Jon here is demonstrating the classic fetal position.
- Odie is in your basic armchair poily position. Z
- When you sleep as much as I do, you crave variety in your attitudes of repose.

- KA-BOOM!
- I love lying under the bed listening to the rain.",ga850625
"-
-",ga850626
"- What do you suppose the chances are of me leaping from this sill and having the window slam shut on my tail?
- SLAM!
- Do I know me or what?",ga850627
"- Most cats would be angry hanging by the tail from a window.
- But not me.
- I'M FURIOUS!",ga850628
"- Let me get you out of the window, Garfield.
- There you go. BONK!
- I don't know whether to thank Jon, or kill him.",ga850629
"- Shoo-doop boowa, shoo-doop boowa.
- Well I was workin' last night on my piston head, when my best friend told me my girl was dead.

"- This tree is tempting me to climb it, but I'm standing my ground this time.
- YOU WHAT?!
- I can't resist a double dare.",ga850701
"- I'll get out of this tree sooner or later. Cats always do.
- No cat has ever lived his whole life up a tree.
- I have. You stay out of this.",ga850702
"- What's your name? Ed.
- Now let me get this straight, Ed. You say you've never been on the ground?
- What's ground? I see...",ga850703
"- Come clean, Ed. You can't tell me you've never been on the ground. That's impossible.
- Maybe you're right.
- Mom, have I ever been on the ground? What's ground?",ga850704
"- Garfield, I'd like you to meet my twin brother, Ted.
- Ed! Ted is a squirrel!
- No wonder mother always liked him best!",ga850705
"- This is just great. Here I am stuck up a tree with a cat who's been raised by squirrels.
- SQUAWK!
- Now what are you doing? Storing birds for the winter.",ga850706
"- Let's see, it's over and under, then through.
- I'm taking you out to eat, Garfield. You'll have to wear this to get into the restaurant.
- I'll have a steak and my ca...er...son will have a triple order of lasagna and a cup of cocoa.
- This is an exclusive restaurant, Garfield. Use your silverware. GULP! SLURP! GULP!
- That marshmallow is meant for your cocoa.
- Heh, heh. Don't lick your paws at the table, son.
- That's the rudest little kid I've ever seen! He even shed on the tablecloth.",ga850707
"- Can you imagine a cat being raised by squirrels? I gotta get Ed out of this tree before it's too late.
- Too late for what?
- Never mind.",ga850708
"- It's time we get out of this tree, Ed. How do we do that?
- CRACK!
- Funny you should ask.",ga850709
"- Welcome to your first step on earth, Ed! What do you think?
- Wow! Wild! Weird!
- What are you doing? I've never walked sideways sideways before.",ga850710
"- Well, Ed, what do you think of your first trip out of your tree?
- Ed?
- I think I have a fear of low places.",ga850711
"- Since you've been raised by squirrels, Ed, you have a lot to learn about being a cat.
- What is that? That is a dog. Cats are afraid of dogs.
- What? I have forgotten.",ga850712
"- I gotta go home, Garfield. What for?
- I miss mother, the squirrel. You're weird, Ed.
- You're lucky, too.",ga850713
"-

"-
- Hey, Garfield! It's going to be a beautiful day! Let's spend it outside!

- I am not too fat. They just don't make chairs the way they used to.
- They don't make doors the way they used to either.",ga850805
"- Garfield, you wouldn't be fat if your eyes weren't larger than your stomach.
-
- THAT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION!",ga850806
"- Garfield, I'm putting you on a diet. ARRRGH!
- I know you hate diets. If you can think of a better way to lose weight, I'm willing to listen.
- Amputate something!",ga850807

"- Slurp, our mission in life is to seek out evil wherever it may lurk.
- LOOK!

- What do you have to say for yourself?
- You only go around nine times in life, so grab for all the gusto you can get.",ga860317
"- Garfield, it's time to put you on another diet. ARRRGH!
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT A DIET COULD DO TO ME?
- I could waste away to normal!",ga860318

- The TV advertisers didn't waste any time.
- I've been on a diet one day and they're already running more food commercials.",ga860319
"- I gotta kick something. This diet is making me grumpy.
- tap
- Not to mention, weak.",ga860320
"- Garfield, I just want to tell you how proud I am of you. Jon, there's something I have to tell you.
- You've done a great job sticking with your diet this week. Listen to me, Jon.
- And that takes a lot of self-discipline. I ate your bunny slippers.",ga860321
"- You shouldn't watch sad movies when you're on a diet, Garfield. You know how emotional you get.
- This isnt a sad movie.
- It's a food commercial.",ga860322

- Oh, sure, I've put on pound or two...
- Or three or four or five.",ga860324
"- Here's your diet salad, Garfield.
- Would you like anything on it? If you don't mind.
- Perhaps you could garnish it with a chocolate cake.",ga860325
"-
- I think I know how Odie stays so slim.
- It must take a lot of energy to be that stupid. RRRRRR",ga860326
"- You have lost three pounds.
- Congratulations, Garfield! Thank, you.
- Pssst, when do I get my fresh batteries? Later.",ga860327
"- Garfield, in order to successfully diet, you must change your eating habits.
-
- SPLUT!",ga860328

- Which one of you is Juanita?
- The one with ""Eau de Vermin"" behind her ears.",ga860402
"- How did you rats get your names? I'm called Rip because I'm fast. Juanita was my grandmother's name.
- How about you, Bob? That's the sound my head makes when it runs into a wall.
- I take it Bob isn't very bright. He couldn't get through a maze with a map.",ga860403
"- Jon will kill me if he finds out I let rats into the house. I'll lure them out with the old ""Pied Piper"" ploy.
- *
- Okay, fat boy. Let's take it from the top.",ga860404
"- What do you guys want to do today? Let's spread pestilence!
- Nah, let's lower somebody's property value. Or take a scenic sewer tour.
- You're disgusting. It's a living. Or run up an old man's pant leg?",ga860405
"- Hello, Garfield. Hello, Arlene.
- I see you're still fat. I see you stil have that space between your teeth.
- At least I can close my mouth. I can go on a diet.
- You're not likely to go on a diet. You're not likely to close your mouth.
- Hey, why are we fighting like children? I'm sorry. I'm sorry too.
- So long, Arlene. So long, Garfield.
- Beaver face. Lard belly.",ga860406

"- Farm life's great, isn't it, Garfield?
- However, I will admit it's a little slow.
- Nothing much to do but count the bricks in the old silo. 14,238",ga860416

- And a bow-bow! And a piggy-piggy!
- Ha-ha, you guys! This must be the famous farm humor I've heard about.",ga860417

- It's about time you saw a sunrise. Then take a picture!
- Where's your sense of adventure? If it's before breakfast, I'm not interested.
- IT'S AN EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE YOU'LL NEVER FORGET! I know, I saw one once in a movie.

"- Never tell a hungry cat the dinner is ALMOST ready.
- Something smells good. What is it?
- I'm going to bake a lasagna, Garfield, Do you wanna help? Let me think about it for a min...sure!
- First we'll brown the hamburger with the tomato sauce and seasonings. I'd better see if this's fresh.
- Then we'll scoop the ricota, slice the mozzarella and grate the parmesan. I'd better see if this stuff's NOT fresh.
- Next, we'll lay a bed of noodles in the pan. One for me, one for the lasagna, one for me...
- And no we'll bake it for one hour at 3750.
- TIME PASSES

"- You know, with Pooky overstuffed like that, you two make a good match.
- Like father, like son, eh?",ga861220
"- Sign here, mister.
- Hey, Garfield. I got an aluminium tree this year. No more mess. No more tradition.
- And for splash and dash, it turns in an electric stand! Is nothing sacred?
- If it's splash and dash Jon wants, this blender would make a keen tree stand.
- Ready for me to plug the tree in, Garfield? Give me a head start!
- WHIRRRR ARRRRGH! HEY, JON! WANT MORE DASH? TRY LIQUEFY!",ga861221
"- Get out of my way, Odie. I'm trying to wrap presents.

"- Good evening, folks. I'd like to start by signing a few Christmas carols!
- SPLUT! BLAT! SPLAT!
- Critics don't even take the holidays off.",ga861223
"- Well, the gifts are under the tree and the food is prepared. There's only one more order of business...
- I just want to tell you guys how much I love you.
- Jon is like Christmas. I only appreciate him once a year.",ga861224
"- WAKE UP, BOYS! IT'S CHRISTMAS MORNING!
- Let's see if Santa brought gifts for all the good little children.
- I guess not. Here's one for Garfield. What the heck, it's Christmas. I'll let him live.",ga861225
"- The day after Christmas I always get drepressed.
- Do you know what I mean, Garfield? Yes, I do.
- If I were you I'd be depressed every day.",ga861226
"- What a dippy sweater.
- It's not the gift, but thought that counts.
- Okay, okay, I THINK it's a dippy sweater.",ga861227
"- EEK!
- Here he is! Z
- Excuse us, Mr. Cat. We desire cheese.
- We can't sleep without our cheese.
- And if we can't sleep, you won't sleep.
- All right! All right!
- Here, if there's nothing else, I'd like to get some sleep.
- You wouldn't happen to have tiny little forks would you? Here's where I turn vicious.",ga861228
"- CAT HAIRS! They're a face of life.
- THERE ARE CAT HAIRS ALL OVER THE PLACE! So, what are you going to do about it?
- I'll be packing my bags and leaving now.",ga861229
"- Wherever I stop, we're stuck with it. Right, Garfield? Right.
- The things Jon will do for excitement...
- click click click click Television roulette.",ga861230
"- You guys will never guess what I found at the store.
- PHONY THE TEETH!
- HAR! HAR! HAR! HAR! Let's bite him in the neck.",ga861231

- I haven't seen these olives in years. And it's only halfway back.",ga870101
"- You're a very brave cat, Garfield, and I know you want me to be proud of you.

"- Attention, lounge lizards! This is your week in the sun. Today we begin celebrating ""National Lazy Week""!
- What's so great about being lazy, you say?
- What if war were declared and nobody showed?",ga870105
"- Is National Lazy Week for you? Ask yourself this:
- Would you be willing to lead a parade in celebration of the lazy life?
- If the answer is yes...you're all wrong for Lazy Week.",ga870106
"- Never confuse being lazy with being apathetic. We lazy people are not apathetic.
- Apathetic people don't care about anything.
- Lazy people care, we just don't do anything about it.",ga870107
"- Do people call you ""worthless""? Do people call you a ""couch potato""?
- Why should we be held up to public ridicule just because we subscribe to a kinetically passive lifestyle. We should stand up for ourselves!
- THE NEXT TIME PEOPLE CALL YOU LAZY, TELL 'EM YOU WERE SICK WHEN YOU WERE A KID!",ga870108
"- Don't forget the National Lazy Week motto, lazy people. ""There must be an easier way"".
- Many great ideas have been spawned from that noble sentiment.
- You can bet it wasn't an exercise freak who invented power steering.",ga870109
"- For those of you who want to stop abusing your bodies through fanatic exercise, but can't muster the willpower...
- You can now join ""Garfield's Exercisers Anonymous"".
- Every time you feel an uncontrollable urge to jog, I send someone over with a mug of warm milk and a tape of the Beverly Hillbillies.",ga870110
"- Waterin' down the coffee again, pilgrim?
- Burp

- JON!
- JON! WAKE UP! I'M HAVING NIGHTMARES!
- Garfield, if you didn't stuff yourself right before going to bed, you wouldn't dream about big, ugly monsters.
- Did you hear what he called you guys?
- I think I'll polish off that pepperoni pizza now.",ga870111
"- Isn't this great, Garfield? We have a whole day of fishing ahead of us! Hotcha.
- HEY! WHERE's THE BAIT? Bait?
- GARFIELD! I thought it was sushi.",ga870112
"- Actually, Garfield is pretty easy to care for.
- Cats are so clean, always primping and washing themselves.
- We're out of foot powder. Almost to a fault.",ga870113
"- Ah, my dear, you're as lovely as ever, but, you look so stiff and formal in that outfit.
- Why don't you slip into something more comfortable?
- LIKE ME!",ga870114
"-
- CHOMP!
- SPRONG!",ga870115
"- Just what is an heirloom?

- zzzzzzz
- zzzzzz Just as I suspected.",ga870117
"- * Oh, Nermalll *
- Kittens love to chase things.
- CRASH! This can be a very satisfying form of enterteinmant.
- BONK! Kittens also love to play catch.
- But, the best way to drive them wild is to hide objects from them.
- ROWR! cRUNCH! HISS!
- But, not for very long.",ga870118
"- GARFIELD! WAKE UP!
- I've made a decision that could alter the course of my entire life.
- I have decided to grow a mustache. I suppose I could blame this on monday.",ga870119
"- Notice anything different about me, Garfield? You're not drinking out of your Binky The Clown mug.
- I think my mustache is coming in rather nicely. That's not your cocoa?
- Wanna touch it? It feels really weird. Hey, buddy, I have to eat with these hands!",ga870120
"- Look Odie! A hideous hairy monster is nesting under Jon's nose!
- Maybe it'sll spread and cover the rest of his face.
- Are you making fun of me? IT MOVED!",ga870121
"- Mustaches do strange things to people.
- They make some guys think they're someone they're not.
- Frankly, my dear, I don't give a darn. I don't feel safe here anymore.",ga870122
"- ARRRGH!
- JON! WHAt HAPPENED? I'M FINE! GO AWAY!
- ARE YOU OKAY? TELL ME! The shaver snagged my mustache, okay?",ga870123
"- I shaved my mustache off, Garfield. Do tell.
- I decided it made me look like a walrus. I'm proud of you, Jon.
- It takes a big walrus to admit his mistakes.",ga870124
"- How's my little buddy today? Crowded.
- TAP TAP TAP
- Garfield, what are you doing?
- SNAP! Charades? I love charades! Let's see...first word...you? No, you're! That's it! You're!
- Leg! No! Stand! You're standing in something!
- Fourth word! MY! You're standing in my!
- I GOT IT! FOOD! YOU'RE STANDNIG IN MY FOOD!
- That was a good one. Now it's my turn. This is a movie title, okay?",ga870125
"-

- Amused, Garfield? That's ""Mr. Fig Face"" to you.",ga870126
"- *
- *",ga870127
"- Here I am falling asleep face down in a bowl of food.
- This is it. I've reached the pinnacle of laziness and gluttony...how depressing.
- There's no place to go after you've reached the top.",ga870128
"- I eat too much because I'm depressed, and I'm depressed because I eat too much.
- It's a vicious circle...
- That took years to perfect!",ga870129
"- BANG! BANG! Hello? Anybody home?
- BRINNNNNG!
- Next time, use the door knocker. Sorry.",ga870130
"-
- STOP RIGHT THERE!

"- Garfield! That was a nasty fall you took. Are you all right`
- Garfield? Who's Garfield?
- OH, nO! HE'S LOST HIS MEMORY! I do seem to rememger being hungry.",ga870203
"- Having anmesia isn't so bad. It'll be kind of fun finding out what a great guy I am.
- ARRRGH!
- OH, NO! I'M A CAT!",ga870204
"- Maybe seeing Odie will jog your memory. What a swell looking dog. Put 'er there.
- YIP! YIP! YIP!
- I woner if I'm going to like this Garfield?",ga870205
"- Look, Garfield. It's Pooky! Your favorite possession and closest friend. Do you remember Pooky?
- Don't be silly. I'm a grown cat. What would I need with a teddy bear?",ga870206
"- Amnesia has wiped my slate clean. I start establishing who I am today.
-
- I am (burp) a glutton.",ga870207
"- Hey, stranger. This body ain't big enough for the both of us.
- What a week...I fall on my head, totally lose my memory, and have no idea who this Garfield fella is.
-
- HANg ON! SOMETHING'S COMING BACK!
- HA! HA!
- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- I'm terribly sorry about that. You see, I'm not myself today.",ga870208
"- Amnesia is weird. This Garfield is like a total stranger to me.
- I know nothing about him.
- Aside from what the creep did to my body.",ga870209
"- This should jog your memory, Garfield... LASAGNA!
- No thank you. You wouldn't have a plump, juicy mouse, wouldn't you?
- ARRRGH! I'd never get this stuff out of my whiskers.",ga870210
"- You just HAVE to restore Garfield's memory, doc.
- He doesn't beat up on Odie, he doesn't claw the furniture, he's not lazy and obnoxious...
- Are you sure you want me to do this? Come to think of it...",ga870211
"- Let's test his reflexes. DONK!
-
- DOING! Normal. For Garfield.",ga870212
"- Perhaps Garfield's amnesia could be cured by lightly traumatizing his cranium.
- KNOCK MY CAT ON THE HEAD?! WHO WOULD EVER DO SUCH A THING?!!
- May I be of assistance? You stay out of this.",ga870213
"- Go ahead. A little tap on the head may bring your cat's memory back. DONK!

- Affectionate sort, isn't he? He's a sucker for sweet talk.",ga870320

- There it is! Just like I told you! Z

- Ready for dinner, Bertha?
- Is the sky blue? Do cats hate dogs?",ga870323
"- I think you're going to like this restaurant, Bertha. As long as they serve food. A woman after my own heart.
- Would you like a table or a booth? A table, please. And the lady will have a booth.
- What do you have to do to get any serive around here? You have to get to your table first. That's a stupid rule.",ga870324

- Then you can march out of that cage and crawl between two slices of bread. JON!",ga870331
"- Garfield, do you like sweety bird? He's right up there with dogs and mondays.

- YOU SHREDDED MY RUNNING SHOES! Someday you'll thank me for that, Jon.
- Jogging's the disease. I'm the cure.",ga870407
"- Okay, stand up straight and put your hands on your hips.

- SLAM! click
- Sometimes Jon can be so thoughtful",ga870509

"- Sigh...
- Garfield, I'm depressed. What a absolute shock.
- I haven't had a date in months. Time sure flies when you're not having fun.
- Maybe I should give Kimmy a call. Wasn't she the one who was raised by wolves?
- She was raised by wolves, wasn't she? I can still hear her baying at the moon.
-
- Hello, Kimmy? It's Jon Arbuckle! Ask her if she's had her shots.",ga040530

- Hi, Jon, it's Liz. I can't decide what to wear tonight.
- At first I thought my blue dress would be perfect, but then I decided my red top and skirt would look even better...
- Then I couldn't find any shoes to go with *that*, so I switched to the green cocktail dress, but the zipper on that was stuck...
- So I tried the purple strapless gown on, but the clutch purse that goes with it has a huge mascara smudge on it, and besides, I still think it makes my hips look big...
- So now I'm back to the dress, unless I can find a way to make that red top and skirt work with sandals, or something open-toed in a neutral color.
- What are you wearing? My suit. Hurray for guys.",ga080525

"- Two days, and you haven't so much as moved an Eyelid!
- That must take some willpower. Au contraire.
- MOVING required willpower.",ga080716

"- My aunt Orpha used to say, ""Christmas comes but once a year"".
- Then she'd say, ""never get under the mistletoe with a molting chicken"".
- Then she'd play the spoons on her forehead. Aunt Orpha was a few walnuts shy of a fruitcake.",ga131206
"- ""It was a stormy night...""
-
- There aren't any pictures. Is there a remote?",ga131207
"-
- Garfield! Odie! Get in here!

- And we want everyone in it!
-
- The pizza guy? He's like family.",ga131208

"- All right, I've hidden your present again.
- And THIS time I've...
- STOP THAT! under the bed...how cliche.",ga131219

- I should have done that years ago.",ga131231
"- We all have our faults, Garfield.
- However, some may have more faults than others.
- Waaaay more. Is this leading to a compliment?",ga140101

- What if these are my final moments?
- And I'm spending them with a cat?! If there were a button, I'd push it.",ga140102

- Yes, I am!
- Garfield... Psst, it would be wise to say something nice to Liz, as well.",ga140103

- Here's something interesting. Whoa!
- Whew! That was close!",ga140104
"-
- Eat meeee.

- Yes, I did, Jon.
- And I wiped my feet on it.",ga140107

"- I'm filled with energy today!
- Or, as I refer to it...

"- Liz, I am a man of principle.
- I live by one simple rule.
- Never stick your tongue in a toaster. We live learn.",ga140117
"- When you eat healthy, you feel healthy.
- I just ate a donut.
- Which is WAAAAY better than feeling healthy.",ga140118
"- Hmmmmm
- Here's a crazy theory, Garfield.
- ""Cats may be invaders from another planet"".
- I don't think so.
- You're too lazy to make the trip.
- And you'd never escape gravity.
- Certainly not from the planet Fatso. Where is my disintegrator gun when I need it?",ga140119
"- I wonder how far I can walk...
-
- We may never know.",ga140120

"- Garfield, this is my life.
- Cleaning up cat hair.
- How sad is that? Now, about my litter box...",ga140130
"- Well, Liz, I think men are superior to women.
- Well, for one, we're more mature.
- Hey, leave my bunny slippers out of this! Wait till she meets Mr. Blankey.",ga140131

"- I need only two things, Liz.
- The love of a good woman...
- And a meticulous sock drawer. Do you know him? No.",ga140207
"- That was my pet mule.
- She had three legs, a glass eye, and one tooth.
- I miss you, Aphrodite! I must have the movie rights.",ga140208
"- Sigh...
- Every time I try to say something romantic to Liz, it comes out wrong.
- Mybe I just need to practice.
- You b eLiz, and I'll say something romantic to you.
- Let's see. How about this?...
- Your eyes are like deep pools of lumpy brown gravy.
- Wow, I'm better than I thought! You had me at ""gravy"".",ga140209
"- I'm in a bad mood.
- And there's only one thing to do when that happens.
- Pass it on. Uh-oh.",ga140210
"-
- Whoa! Apple pie!
- I must check behind my back more often!",ga140211

- What ELSE can go wrong?
- You said it.",ga140216
"- It's time to put an end to...
-
- It's time to start something.",ga140217
"- I found my toolbox, Garfield!
- A man without tools is no man at all!
- Now, how does this open? Turn in your man card.",ga140218
"- I have tools, Garfield!
- Men and tools built skyscrapers, you know...
- Like with this thingy. Put it back before you hurt somebody.",ga140219
"- Oh, that's just great!
- The mice are using the cat for a bed!
- Should I make little blankets?! There is a chill. Ignore him.",ga140220
"- Jon's dealing with the mouse problem in a very unique way.
- He's trying to adapt.
- Today is the worst day of my life. Say cheese.",ga140221

- So, how was the movie?",ga140406
"- Garfield, I feel lazy. Yes, come to the dark side.
- Maybe I need to exercise. No! No! Come back!
- Or eat cookies and watch TV. Yes, come to me, my son.",ga140407
"- The ancients believed cats were good luck.
-
- They died out. Who's feeding the cats?!",ga140408

"- My prom was traumatic.
- I had to wear dad's tuxedo.

- Roll over.
- I'm not doing this again. You want me to get flat on one side?",ga140421

- Gee, I feel so dog-like! Wake me in an hour.",ga140422
"- Catch me, Jon!
-
- Didn't you used to be taller?",ga140423
"- Yup, years ago I offended an old gypsy woman.
- She put a curse on me.
- ""Take this cat,"" she said! I'm sensing negativity here.",ga140424
"- I'm bored, Garfield.
- Let's do something.

- You're so sweet.
- It's Liz. I figured it was that or you were talking to a donut.",ga140509

- Of course there's something to be said for that instant gratification thing, too.",ga140513
"- Life is a mystery, Garfield.
- So many questions.
- Like, what day is this? You are so cosmic.",ga140514
"- Life is a reflecting pool, Garfield.
- Where one can see one's true self.
- I have cool hair. The water must be murky today.",ga140515
"- What's your favorite polka song, Liz? Uh...
- I don't think I have one.
- Too hard to choose, huh? Just nod your head and back away slowly.",ga140516

- Chapter two...
- That's where I get kidnapped by aliens. I suspected as much...",ga140517
