"- Hi, there...I'm Jon Arbuckle. I'm a cartoonist, and this is my cat, Garfield.
- Hi, there. I'm Garfield. I'm a cat, and this is my cartoonist, Jon.
- Our only thought is to entertain you. Feed me. Happy birthday, Garfield. I have a surprise for you.
- A rubber mousey!
- Could've used a little salt... A MOUSE! GET IT!
- Garfield! You didn't even try!
- Show me a good mouser, and I'll show you a cat with bad breath. I'm putting you on a diet, Garfield...here's your dinner.
- WHA...
-
- Ahhhhh...
- Happiness is a warm television set. SLAP!
-
- Don't be cruel, Garfield. Put the catburger out of its misery and eat it. Cats...
- We cats are intelligent, soft, cute...
- furry cuddly...
- playful...
- demure...
-
- and masters of the house. We cats like to sit in high places. It reinforces our superiority.
-
- Help.
-
- Garfield, you dummy. Here, Garfield, ...beg.
- EEYOUCH!!
- Groveling is not one of my strong suits. You can't drink coffee, Garfield. You'll stunt your, uh, your...
-
- One lump or two? All I ever do is eat and sleep, eat and sleep, eat and sleep.
- There must be more to a cat's life than that.
- But, I hope not. This is it, Garfield, the late-late movie with Brigitte Bardot.
- Got our soda pop. Got our popcorn. We're set.
- zzzzzz zzzzz I'm out of shape.
- I think I'll take up jogging.
-
-
- pant pant pant
- Whew! Made it!
- PURRR
- I hate static electricity. I really shouldn't eat that fish...
-
- Call it an ethnic weakness. itch scratch scratch
- scratch! scratch! scratch! scratch! itch scratch! scratch! scratch! scratch!
- AARRRGH! SNIFF!
- Cat food...
- The bouquet leaves something to be desired. Ah, a curtain upon which to sharpen my claws.
-
- I hate double-knit. Dear Garfield: Believe it or not, I am an ugly kitten! Oh, I do all the things ""cute"" kittens do...play with yarn and such, but I don't get any attention. What can I do? Mud Fence
- Dear ""Mud"": You're trying too hard to be cute. You'll get more attention if you just be yourself...
- And sharpen your claws on the living room drapes. STEAK!
- BANZAI!
- POOMP!
-
- GARFIELD!
- HISSS!
- Even a house cat has to forage for himself once in a while. Hmmmm...a new sofa.
-
- Much better. I'm getting lazy. It would do me good to get some exercise.
- YAWN
- Much better. Love a cookout.
-
- Mind if I smoke? I'm going to take an active part in energy conservation.
- Get on your mark, get set...
- Conserve. You're going to love this movie, Garfield. It's my all-time favorite.
- Now here's where lieutenant Lacroix finds a spot of blood on the butler's sleeve...so he figures, ""Aha! This guy is acting very suspicio
- I'm just your average, ordinary cat...
- For instance, I'm crazy about nature's most perfect food...
- LASAGNA!
- Garfield! Bath time!
- zippppp!
- GARFIELD?
-
- SCREEEEEE
-
- You do what you have to. This is the life. I don't think I'll ever get out of bed again.
-
- I'm hungry. Good news, Garfield!
- The administration says the rate of inflation is going down.
- That and a buck-fifty will get you a cup of coffee. Ah, here comes the mailman.
-
- Why should dogs have all the fun? Oh boy, oh boy, today is thursday and that's Lasagna Day.
- CAT FOOD!
- Tickle, tickle,
- TICKLE-TICKLE-TICKLE
- I think I'm going to throw up. YAWN

- Garfield, you're a fat, arrogant, lazy pig.
- Well, excuuuuuuse me!
-
- Garfield, cut that out! SQUIRT!

- Garfield, you should really learn to control your temper.
- Now where could my pipe be?
- GARFIELD!! POOK!

-
- Heh, heh, heh. M-I-C
- A cat who likes Mickey Mouse. K-E-Y
- Shake it, Annette.
-
-
-
-
- Don't try looking cute at me, Garfield. You still can't have any of my steak. Girl scouts like me.
- B-B-B-B-B-B
- AAAAAAAA I amuse them. scratch scratch scratch scratch
- Oops. I got a scratch on Jon's favorite chair.
- Maybe he won't notice. One last olive.
-
- clunk clunk clunk
- SSSSSS
- One word about curiosity killing the cat, and I'll break your face. I hate television commercials.
- They're too long to sit through...
- -and they're too short for a trip to the sandbox!
-
- Never trust a smiling cat.
- Nothing to do today but hang on the screen door...
- I'm bored.
- Bored, bored, bored, bored.
- Bored, bored, bored, Bored, bored, bored, Bored, bored, bored.
- I wish something would happen.
- GARFIELD, LUNCH TIME!!! SLAM!
- I'm in pain... pain, pain, pain, pain. DING DONG
- Lyman. Jon.
- I'm cold. I'm hungry. I'm weak. Take me in!
- Sure, Lyman. You know my home is your home. And my sandbox is off-limits. Is that all you have, the one suitcase? Not exactly.
- HERE BOY!
- Oh, lawsey, lawsey, lawsey. Come on, Garfield. Snap out of this deep blue funk. So what if a dog moved in...
- You can handle it. Cheer up.
-
- Take me now, lord! What's your dog's name? Odie.
- Odie...a dog named Odie...
- A blimp named Hindenburg...a ship named Titanic...a car named Edsel. A fresh...
- CRASH!
- Ten billion dogs in this world, and I get Tweedledee, the wonder dummy. WOOF!
- BARK!
- YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! Poor me.
- Sigh...a big, vicious, brute of a dog has moved into *my* home...
-
- GRAB!
- whap whap whap whap whap whap whap
- dribble dribble dribble
- PUNT
- How will I ever survive? Does it hurt to rub a cat the wrong way? I don't know.
- ROWRRRR!! Yup. Odie! Look what you did on the floor!
- yip! yip! yip! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! whap! whap! whap!
- They should've named him ""Spot"". Lyman, you gotta housebreak Odie. How?
- Swat him with something. With what?
-
- pat pat pat pat
- I think I'll put that dog's lights out.
-
- scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
- THOCK!
- New dance? Bad aim. We cats are the source of many myths...
- The saying, ""nervous as a cat"", is an old wive's tale.
- BARK!
-
-
- Not to mention, ""a cat always lands on its feet"". Heh, heh, heh. splash splash splash
- Cats just love to play with water.
- Whew! I thought I'd never find Jon's watch. dab dab dab dab
- SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH!
- MY CHICKEN SOUP! The devil made me do it. Hey, Jon! What do you think of my new outfit?
-
- Does Garfield always shed like that? Only on white disco suits. munch munch munch
- PUNT
- Gotta keep my strength up.
-
-
- SPLOOCH!
- Help yourself to the lasagna, Garfield. You're getting a little chunky there, pal.
- I'm thinking of putting you on a diet, Garfield.
- DIET!
- I'm already feeling weak!
- FOOD! I need FOOD!
- The room's growing dim!
- WHOP!
- clap clap clap clap clap clap Garfield, as of this minute, I'm putting you on a diet.
- Garfield?
- I think I snapped his mind. Come on, old buddy. Going on a diet's not all that bad. Why, a couple of pounds off the middle and you'll be fit and trim again.
- THAT'S BETTER.
- I didn't have the heart to tell him he's made the weight watcher's ten most-wanted list. So I'm on a diet...big deal.
- You know what a ""diet"" is, don't you?
- IT'S ""DIE"" WITH A ""T,"" THAT'S WHAT IT IS! A diet. Jon has me on a diet.
- POOMP!!
- When the lasagna content in my blood gets low, I get mean.
- Wax!
- Everything tastes good when you're on a diet. Let's see see how well you've done o your diet this week, Garfield.
- Now where's the bathroom scale?
- I'm sitting on it. I hate summer. I gotta beat this heat somehow.
- Ahhh, Jon's fan...
- Jon's sunglasses.
- Jon's hat.
-
- Some ice cubes and Jon's old kiddy pool.
- Mornin', Jon. Here's your mail. Labor day, shmabor day. What a dumb day.
- To hire some jerk, then send him away...
- To celebrate work by playing all day.
-
-
-
- Hee-hee-he
- HA-HA-HA-HA-HA
- And that's all for mystery theater. ...good night.
- CLICK!
- CLICK! GARFIELD! CUT THAT OUT! What're you doing tonight, Lyman? I'm gonna catch the new flick down at the bijou.
- It's about this kid who puts a tack in his teacher's chair, and she sits on it.
- Not much of a plot. I suppose not. But I still enjoy the movies where the boy gets the girl in the end. BRINNNG!
-
- Mornin', Lyman. Good morning, Jon.
- Ready to go? Be right with you.
- GARFIEEELD!! zzzz
- Rise'n'shine, old buddy. Time to go jogging!

- PURRR!
- Have some lasagna, Garfield... purrr CRINKLE RUSTLE CRINKLE
-
- Garfield, get out of the trash. Darn bugs. buzzzzz

-
-
-
- SLAM!
-
-
- Veterinary Clinic Somehow they always know. bat bat
-
- FWIP FWIP FWIP
- I hate mondays. Hey, Garfield. Meet Hondo the puppet.

- Not to mention curdled kitty munchies. Z
- Snort, uh-oh!
- Oh Ow Eep Ipp Ooh Aah Ooch

- Sunburned tummy. Oh boy, at last. College football season.
- I would have played college football had it not been for my beliefs...
- I don't believe in bleeding on saturday! How would you like to be unnecessarily roughed? I hate dogs.

- Heh, heh heh.
- Here, Odie. Have a steak. pat pat
-
- pant pant pant FWID!
- FLUFF FLUFF
- Garfield! Time to eat!
- I hate mondays. All dogs should be banned from our country...
- They are noisy, silly, sloppy, rude...
- And they're rusting our nation's fire hydrants. Tum, dee-dum, dee-dum.
- PUNT!
- If it weren't for my naturally sweet nature, I'd make life rough for that dog. bbbbb
- BARK!
- I'd hate to see that sucker's bite! Garfield
- BARK!
- If god had intended for dogs to bark, he would have given them roots and leaves. BIFF!
- BOP!
- SMACK! POKE! Garfield, one. Odie, one. Ahem...mee, mee, mee
- MEEEYOWRRRRR

- Good idea. I'll get him one.
- Bless you! Surprise, Garfield! Oh boy, a scratching post.
- FWING!
- scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
- It wasn't the living room drapes, but I'll give it a seven. YAWN
- That floor sure looks cold this morning.
- Better not risk it. I'm not getting out of the bed if the floor is cold.
- It's freezing!
- Good. zzzzz
- BARK!
- Now that I'm up...I might as well have breakfast. Good morning, Garfield.
- Today we're going to learn to walk on a leash.
-
-
- KABONKA BONKA BONKA
- ROWRR!
- I tell you, Thelma, this neighborhood is getting weirder by the minute. buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
- zzzzzz
- SPLOSH

- Ever thought of walking AROUND the furniture?
- Oh well...I guess a cat is entitled to let down on his defenses once in his life.
- water water water
- pat pat pat
- What's the use? Garfield! I'm back from the store.
- We're having a cookout tonight. I got steak and corn and...
- And you just ate the briquettes.
-
- Cats are nice to have when you're feeling lonely.
-
-
-
-
-
- BLINK!
- I win again.
-
- I think I'll have Garfield declawed. Garfield, I'm going to have you declawed.
- TAKE AN ARM! TAKE A LEG! BUT SPARE MY CLAWS.
- You're going to be declawed and that's it. Now get your head out of the oven! I couldn't face life as a declawed person. So I'll just stick my head in this oven and end it all.
-
- Stupid electric stove. Jon's gonna have me declawed.
- What a frightening thought...
- Going through life unarmed. I took Garfield to the vet to be declawed.
- They're removing his stitches next thursday.
- Poor Garfield. Who's talking about Garfield? I'm sorry I tried to have you declawed, Garfield.
- I love you just the way you are, claws and all.
- someday, somehow, when you're least expecting it, I'm going to shred your bedroom suite. OHHH, GARFIELD!
- AHA!
- puff puff
- GOT'CHA!
-
-
-
- GARFIELD! Come back here and take your vitamin pill! Hello, what's this?
- A teddy bear. A dumb, stupid, silly-looking old teddy bear.
- I think I'll call him ""Pooky"".
-
- I didn't see that. I didn't see that. I didn't see that. I didn't see that.
- GET AWAY FROM MY FOOD, BEAR!
- I just yelled at a teddy bear. Ho, Garfield. I will not kiss your teddy bear good night.
-
- SMACK Ahhh...nothing like a hot bath after a chilly day.
-
- GARFIELD! Wanna warm up, Pooky? Oh, boy! My bachelor magazine. -I wonder who the centerfold is: Elke? Farrah?
- Almira, the amazon? It's that time of year again...
- At Halloween, we cats become bewitched...
- Our eyes turn blood red...
- Our fangs grow...
- And our hair stands up.
- Not to mention longer claws.
-
- AAY! EEE!
- That's right, doc. He screamed turned white, and passed out. Ah, here comes the mailman.
- DRAT!
- BARK!
- ODIE! CUT THAT OUT!
- Stick with me, kid. We'll go places. I hate november.
- Lifeless trees, bleak afternoons, raw winds...
- Icy sandboxes. KABOING! KABOING! KABOING!
- KABOING! KABOING! KABOING! KABOING!
- Food's fun! SCREEE!
- Four ply, steel-belted, radial retread tenny pumps.
- ZOOOOOM!
- ZIP!
- That hurt me more than it did him. GARFIELD!!
-
- Hmmmm. A little nippy outside today.
- tap tap tap But I GOTTA get some exercise.
- I can wait.
- Might as well get over it.
- And then again...
- MAKE UP YOUR MIND! Some people have anxiety attacks. Some people have gas attacks.
- I have nap attacks.
- ZZZZZ NAP ATTACK!
- FUMP!
- I've heard of catnaps, but this is ridiculous. zzzz NAP ATTACK!
- CRASH!
- Whoever thought a nap attack could hurt? My tuna pate could use some salt.
- Oops! Here comes another nap attack.
- There you have it. Garfield's passion for food is only exceeded by his passion for sleep. zzzzzzzz Gee, I'd love to stay in bed all day, but I gotta eat sometime.
- BUZZ SAW SAW SCRATCH SCRATCH CUT CUT BZZZ
- Ohooh. I feel a nap attack coming on.
-
- Turtles have got it knocked.
-
- Why don't you boys go fight or something?
- Him Jon! SLAM! Hi, Lyman.
- I'm starved! What's to eat? Nothing, I'm eating the last of the food.
- ZZZZZ SNORT! ZZZZ
- MMMPH!
- ARRRRRRRGH! Sleeping people are fun. I love lasagna! So do I.
- GOBBLE! GOBBLE! GOBBLE! GOBBLE!
- I love cats...I wanted a cat...so what do I do? I go to the pet store and ask for a cat. What do they give me? ...a lasagna with fur and fangs. Cats need a balanced diet.
- Meat, eggs, fruit, bread, vegetables...
- And an occasional boston fern for dessert. Oh no! Jon got a rocking chair!
- As long as there is one rocking chair left in the world, no cat's tail is safe.
- MY ROCKING CHAIR! Your kindling. Let's see...the piano, book shelves, bench, floor...
- Nope, I think I'll go with the chest, chair, hassock, floor.
- Hmmm...one canister is doggie biscuits and the other is kitty munchies, but I forget which is which.
- WHAM!
- MEYOWR! BARK!
- ROWR! FFFT! ROWR! BARK! BARK!
- Hold it down, you guys.
- meyowr woof
- ROWR! FFFT! ROWR! BARK! BARK!
- ONE MORE SOUND OUT OF YOU TWO, AND YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE!
- RING! Hello? BARK! ROWR! Ahhh, six A.M.
- This is my favorite time of day.
- For sleep.
-
- GARFIELD! He sure wakes up in a bad mood, doesn't he? I love scrambled eggs.
- Especially on chilly mornings...
- When my feet get cold. I'm basically your neat cat.
- CRASH!
- I like to keep my windowsill tidy. We cats are loners.
- With one possible exception...
- We can be very social when it comes to food. Okay, Garfield, just one bite of lasagna and that's it.
-
- It's amazing how much that cat can store in his cheeks. AHA!
- To be sure you stay away from my pie, I'm going to put this bell around your neck. ding-a-ling a-ling a-ling
- I should have thought of this long ago. ding-a-ling a-ling a-ling
- Heh-heh, Garfield is in the bedroom now. ding-a-ling a-ling a-ling
- He's going through the bathroom. ding-a-ling a-ling a-ling
- Now he's coming down the hall into the living room. ding-a-ling a-ling
- ding-a-ling a-ling a-ling
- No ding-a-ling's going to keep me away from my pie. Oh, doe! sniff

- He gabe me a code! Pardon?
- GABE ME A CODE! GABE ME A CODE! BRRR!
- YAWN!
-
-
-
-
- I know you're in there somewhere, Garfield! ...OUT!!!
- Next time I'll leave a wake-up call at the desk. Do you know your cat's sitting on my meat loaf?
- No, but if you hum a couple of bars I'll fake it.
- This is going to be a long week. See you later, Garfield. I'm going to the grocery store.
-
- Very well, you may come along. Now, behave yourself in the grocery store, Garfield.
-
- I think I just turned a bull loose in a china shop. That's the last time I take you to the grocery store, Garfield.
- I've never been so humiliated in all my life.
- So I ate the pastry section, big deal.
- Darn
- That was too easy. When Odie comes by I'm going to round off that pointy head of his.
- SLURP!
- How can you win against someone who doesn't even know the rules of the game?
-
-
- HERE, ODIE!
-
- Isn't it a little cold to take Odie foe a walk? NONSENSE!
- Things To Do: 1. wash car 2. do laundry
-
- 3. and brush Garfield I own a cat.
- And when you own a cat, eating a normal meal takes on an all-new perspective.
- Knowing that somewhere in there is a cat hair with your name on it. I'm going to brush all your loose hair out, Garfield.
-
- I suspected as much. sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep
- Garfield, what am I supposed to do with all these cat hairs?! Make yourself another cat.
- I have the distinct feeling that I was just zinged. SMACK! Good night, Garfield.
- POOEY!
- Growing a beard? I ate a milk dud and kissed a cat. Dear Garfield, Help! I have cat hairs all over my home. What can I do to keep Fluffy from shedding?
- Simple.
- Give the little beggar a good coat of varnish. scratch scratch scratch scratch
- Uh-oh
- Just look what you've done to my chair!
- You should be more considerate of other people's property.
- Now I know it's natural for cats to sharpen their claws.
- Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and cats gotta claw, but do it outside, okay? Garfield?
-
- GARFIELD zzzzzz
- YAWN!
- What a heck of a way to wake up.
-
-
-
-
- I know cats are fast, but THAT'S ridiculous. JON! COME QUICK!
- Look! Garfield is actually playing with Odie! I know. It's cause I sprayed Odie with something.
- With what? Essence of lasagna. You know, maybe there's more to life than just eating and sleeping...maybe I should be more considerate of other people's feelings, nicer to Odie and more generous.
-
- Nah. Scratching posts, Balls of yarn and rubber mousies are okay.
- But when it comes to REALLY NEAT playthings...
- Give me a Christmas tree! What would you like for Christmas, Garfield? 100 slave dogs.
- I'll bet you'd like a nice, fluffy ball of yarn to play with.
- I think I'll put a piranha in his Christmas stocking.
- HO-HO-HO
- WHUMP!
- Let's see, gifts for Jon, Lyman and Odie.
- Hmmm
- Oh, yes, and Garfield.
- How could I ever forget Garfield...
- Only kid in the world to ask for 20 pounds of lasagna. This is my very first Christmas.
- I hope you have a loved one to spend today with because I do.
- It's you. Merry Christmas. Okay, Garfield. Go fetch!
- *
- Time to get up, Garfield. zzzz
- GRRRRR
- Now what do I do? zzzz
- PUSH
- CLONK! I'm not known for my compassion. I love Fridays.
- The end of a long work week, the beginning of a weekend filled with relaxation, TV sports and parties.
- Almost makes me wish I had a job. This year I resolve to be nicer to dogs.
-
- Maybe I'll cut down on lasagna instead. It's time to make a new year's resolution, Garfield.
- I resolve to lose weight and start exercising this year.
-
- What am I saying?
- I must be going waka-waka!
- I'm NOT going to diet! ... I'm NOT going to exercise!
- I'M FAT, I'M LAZY, AND I'M PROUD *OF* IT!
- Where's Garfield? He ate the buffet and went to bed. POW!
-
- What would you like for breakfast, Garfield? A cup of coffee, a danish and the newspaper.
- Have a warm bowl of milk.
- You people don't give us cats any credit! Do you know why I don't like warm milk?
- Try this...drink a bowl of warm milk.
- Then, never brush your teeth again. Why is it all us cats are stereotyped?
- ""All cats love milk, hate dogs, love mice"" etc., etc., etc.
- Sometimes I get so mad I could just kick my Gucci scaring post. Do you know why you need me, Garfield?
- I can sum it up in two words.
- Quality companionship. Body heat. We cats are very independent.
- We need nobody, no time no where, no way.
- Isn't that right, Pooky? What, ho?
- Oh, goody, a blueberry muffin.
- ZIPPPPP
-
- scratch scratch scratch
- KICK!
- CRASH!
- If pardon the expression, there's more than one way to skin a cat. Look what my mother made for you, Garfield.
- There, how's that? It's nice and warm.
- Disgusting, demeaning, itchy and abomination. But, nice and warm. Would you just look at this? Jon's making me wear a kitty sweater.
- People dress their pets up because it makes them look like little people. Well, I'm NOT a little person, I'm a CAT.
- For instance, I like a pinch of catnip in my morning cup of coffee. Here he comes. Say something nice.
- Lookin' good, Garfield.
- Sharp sweater, ol' buddy.
- Sad. Looks like a meatball in traction. I was feeling pretty punk about having to wear a sweater...
- Until I saw Odie's new outfit.
- Uh-oh, it's starting to rain.
- I'd better let Garfield in before he gets his new sweater wet.
- Too late. snicker snicker
- HARF! HARF! HARF!
- When you own a cat, its hairs get everywhere.
- Every time I eat, I find a cat hair in my food. Let me show you.
- I know it's here something.
-
-
- I CAN'T EAT 'TIL I FIND THAT HAIR!
- Silly me. I forgot to put it in there.
- Garfield, you shouldn't chase the mailman like that.
- Now what would you do with him if you actually caught him? I'd eat him. Garfield, you know cats can't drink...
- SLURP! ...coffee.
- Fill 'er up! Well, I'll be dipped.
-
- It's amazing how we've grown to understand each other. Look, Garfield. A mouse!
- EEEK!
- Bachelorhood is okay, I guess.
- But you just can't beat...
- someone waiting for you when you get home. BARK! BARK!
- ROWR! YAP! FFFT!
- And they say pets are therapeutic. scratch scratch scratch
- Uh-oh. FLEAS!
-
-
- Alcohol should do the trick.
- Much better.
- puff puff
-
- FOOMP
- There's something to be said for flea collars. Garfield, you sleep to much, you eat too much, and you watch too much television.
- What does Jon expect of me, anyway?
- I'm only human. Television can be habit forming.
- I've been watching it all day.
- Would you like me to turn the TV on, Garfield? That would be nice. We've gotta stop watching the all-night movies on television, Garfield.
- But, of course, last night was an exception.
- Who would possibly turn off the Ethen Barrymore film festival? BANG! BANG! EEEK!
- SMACK!
- Okay, okay. I'll change the channel. I don't like violence. I hate television.
- There are too many commercials, reruns and game shows.
- The eight hours I watched yesterday was terrible. Television is only so much mindless drivel...
- Glossy adventures, sex and violence.
- Ain't it great? YAWN!
- smack smack smack
- Oh my.
- Just look at that gorgeous sunrise!
- Mother nature certainly uses every color on her vast palette to paint a dawn. Truly blessed are we, the early risers.
- Have you ever seen a more beautiful sunset, Garfield?
- Hmmm...I must have overslept. Garfield, you are disgustingly, slovenly, sloppy fat.
- Poor Jon.
- He obviously has disgustingly, slovenly, sloppy fat confused with ""big-boned"". Brenda, meet Garfield. Hi, Garfield.
- Is Garfield a pig? He's a cat.
- Oh, that REALLY hurts. ahhh
- CRASH!
- Face it, Garfield. Windowsills just aren't built for us queen-sized felines. If you take one bite of my pie, Garfield, I'll smack your fat little paws.
-
- If I can't have it, neither can he. I'll bet you can't wait to see what kind of cat food you're having for dinner. I'll bet I can.
- Here it comes... You can cut the tension with a knife.
- LIVER! Oh, hooray, hop about, clap paws, squeal with glee. Now I wouldn't say you're fat, Garfield...
- But when you sit around the sofa, you SIT AROUND the sofa.
- KICK! Heads, he lives. Tails, he dies.

-
-
-
-
- Let's see...iodine, band-aids, gauze, bullwhip, small straight-jacket, helmet, pan, shampoo, gloves, rinse, conditioner, blow dryer, brass knuckles, towel, rope, elbow pads...
- Garfield's bath day? Garfield's bath day. I think I'll do some jogging.
- Okay...GO, FEET!
- Hmmm, reckon the little suckers just weren't in the mood. Garfield, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't read over my shoulder
-
- READ over my shoulder? Stay away from my chicken leg, Garfield. Aw, stuff it in your ear. mrow fft!
- WHAT WAS THAT?!
- Oh. Gee...I wonder which shirt goes better with my slacks.
- Lyman, could you give me your opinion on something? Sure.
- What can I do for you? Forget it. Beau Brummell lives.
-
- He's trying to tell me to turn the heat up. Guess what, Garfield? Somewhere on me is a kittie munchie for you.
-
- Maybe that wasn't such a good idea. munch munch munch NAB!
- I'm going to give you a bath, Garfield. You and what army?
-
-
- Okay...I give up. You can go.
- SPLOOSH
- I hate cold floors in the morning.
- Nobody likes cold floors.
- But we cats have to put twice as many feet on them. Pets are great to have on cold nights.
- As long as you don't mind...
- The crowded conditions. BARK! YIP! ROWR! FFFT!
- GARFIELD! ODIE! Why don't you boys go outside to fight.
- While I lie here and quietly bleed to death. * * *
- GARFIELD! Get off the piano!
- Talk about stifling one's creative talents. There's one nice thing about being a cat at the dinner table.
-
- Everything you touch is yours. What's a six-letter word for ""pain,"" Garfield?
- ARRRGH!!!
- Is that with three or four r's? scrub scrub scrub scrub
-
-
-
- CLICK!
- GARFIELD! STOP!
- It's below freezing out there. You say you want me to eat this hamburger, Pooky?
- And this chicken? And this lasagna?
- You gotta go a long way to find a teddy bear as good as old Pooky here. SMACK!
- HEY YOU! Come back here and fight like a teddy bear!
- What am I saying? Be honest, Pooky. Do you think I'm getting a little pudgy around the middle?
-
- Not a lot of personality, but he certainly knows when to keep his mouth shut.
-
- A dancing bear? Next time, I get to lead. Let's go for a walk, little fella.
- SMACK!
- Well, I'll be. Pooky doesn't like dogs either. Okay, who knocked my fern off the windowsill?!
-
- His lying to me isn't half so upsetting as the credit he's giving my intelligence. kaboing kaboing kaboing
- purrr
- Garfield
- bat bat
- ROWR! FFFT!
-
- scratch! scratch! scratch!
- That should hold you cat fans for a while. Stand aside, cat. I know karate!
-
- And I know fast and furious.
-
- Some days I'm just not in the mood to be adored. Woould puppy tat wike a bowl of milk?
- Would funny wooking man wike a milk bath?
- Never be condescending to a cat.
- GARFIELD! Did you eat my chicken?
- No, of course not. If you had, there would be some bones left. Be careful around this clock, Garfield. It's an old family heirloom.
- CRASH!
- One small push for a cat, one giant leap for good taste. Where were you, Garfield? I called you an hour ago for dinner. Uh-oh.
- KLUNK!
- You've got to get to cat food before it sets up. tie tie
- tie tie tie
- yank yank
- LEAP!
- SPROING!
- Booga! Booga!
- KLONK!
- That was a lot of trouble but it was worth it. zzzz YAWN
- zzzzz
- What a heck of a way to start the week. The darn toaster isn't working again. I guess I'll have to fix it.
- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- First, you have to get its attention. Breakfast is on, Garfield.
- Carry me.
- Sometimes I think I cater to Garfield too much.
- That's called disco dancing, Garfield. Thank heavens.
- For a minute there I thought he had a life carp in his jockey shorts. Garfield, that steely-eyed cowcat, roams into town.
- He mounts his faithful steed, Odie.
- All I need now is a sunset.
-
- Just when you think you've seen your cat do it all... buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
- SPLOOSH
- splutter splutter
- FLOP!
- ptooey! ptooey! ptooey!
- wipe wipe
- CRASH
- If I act casual, maybe he won't notice.
- SWISH!
- The mouth is quicker than the hand.
- KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
- Nobody home.
- I suppose I should learn to like Odie.
- But I just can't respect anyone who turns around three times to lie down.
- Hmmm
- Just as I suspected. There's a tiny sign in there saying, ""Space For Rent"". BARK! BARK! BARK!
- That's good enough. SCREEE POOMP!
- Thanks for the exercise. PUNT!
- pat pat pat pat
- You didn't see that. Hmmm, Jon's drawing board. Hmmm, some paper. Hmmm, some ink.
- I think this world would be a nicer place in which to live: If countries could settle their differences without hurting anybody. If everyone smiled at even people they didn't know.
- If nobody had to steal. I people laughed more. If everyone fed their cats all the lasagna they could eat. If we all took more pride in our homes and our neighborhoods.
- If we respected our senior citizens more. If there were no violence in movies and television. If everyone could read and write. If families talked more.
- If friends hugged more. If everyone stopped at least once a weak to stroke a cat. After all, we're all in this together.
- Hey, Garfield.
- What's this? Oh, just some paw prints. I'm going to teach you to do some tricks this week, Garfield. Over my dead body.
- Sing for me, Garfield. MROWR!
- VERY GOOD! There was a bone in my tuna pate. Garfield, go fetch my pipe, paper and slippers. Yes, sir. Right away, sir...
- Where IS he?
- GARFIELD! Okay, okay. As soon as I'm done with the financial section. Roll over, Garfield. You gotta be kidding.
- If you roll over, I'll give you a double helping of lasagna.
- WHIRRRRRR! Speak, Garfield, speak.
- Why, of course, Jon. Is there any particular topic on which you'd like to converse?
- B-B-B-B-B Sit up and beg for the kitty munchy, Garfield.
- Tell you what. You give me the munchy and I'll let you keep your face.
- I knew that we could arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise. Dance for me, Garfield. Not a chance.
- If you won't, I'm sure Odie would be happy to.
- You have to know what motivates a cat. This is demeaning.
-
- sigh
-
- Ho hum
-
- Ever had one of those days when you feel like you've slept and eaten it all? Ah, it's early morning for the caped avenger. Ring!
- The caped avenger who searches out evil wherever it may lurk.
- The late-morning evil, that is. The caped avenger sees food!
- In order to fight evil, the caped avenger needs food for strength.
- Lots and LOTS of strength! AHA! The caped avenger sees injustice. BONK!
-
- Beat it, brute. BOOT! The caped avenger sees a large evil person he must destroy in the name of good, because the caped avenger isn't a chicken.
-
- The caped avenger isn't stupid, either. The caped avenger will now fly down and destroy the evil mailman.
-
- SPLAT!
- I think the caped avenger is starting to believe his own press releases. The caped avenger will now step outside to fight evil.
-
- The caped avenger will now step inside and announce his retirement. I'm so bored.
- Hmmmm
- ptu! twing! YIP! SPLOOSH!
- BONK!
- KICK!
- Much better. Did you know most cats shed their winter coats in warm weather, Garfield?
- FUMP!
- Hmmm mus' be spring. Spring is here.
- The warm spring sun is coaxing trees to bud and flowers to bloom. Fledging songbirds are testing their lilting voices. Soft spring zephyrs are wafting the sweet scent of lilacs. Spring is here.
- Big, fat hairy deal. There's nothing like a little spring weather to make one feel lazy.
- I'd better be careful.
- If I were lazier, I could slip into a coma. I like spring.
- The grass is back from its dormancy. The flowers are back from a long winter's rest.
- And the birds are back from Miami. I just love to lie out in this warm spring sun.
- Uh-oh.
- I think I just melted. Ah, spring. In the spring a young man's fancy turns lightly to thoughts of love.
-
- And the street department puts a fresh coat of rust-resistant paint on the fire hydrants. click
- I'm going to stare at this toaster until the toast pops up.
-
-
-
-
-
- A watched pot never boils, Garfield. Huh? pop
- See? Drat...drat, drat, drat, drat. Move it, Garfield, I'm going to watch television.
-
- Boy, am I in a bad mood. *Good Morning, Garfield*
- POKE!
- If there's anything a depressed person hates, it's a cheerful person. Garfield's sure been in a nasty mood lately. We'll see about that. Do you know how to treat a mad cat?
-
- With great, great respect.
- ROWR! FFFT!
- I think I hurt myself. I know you've been in a nasty mood this week, Garfield. Many of us occasionally feel angry for no reason at all...psychologists all it a free-floating anxiety.
- SPLAT! FREE-FLOAT THIS!
- I wonder if this ever happened to Freud. Easy, boys.
- WE LOVE YOU, GARFIELD!
- Darn. That was the best deep blue funk I ever had going. scratch scratch scratch
- scratch scratch scratch
- pat pat pat
- scratch scratch pat pat
- scratch scratch pat pat
- scratch pat
- BARK! YIP! ROWR!
- I don't think I could take much more loving. Let's go check the mailbox, Garfield.
- I love getting mail
- It's just another reminder you're alive. That's a pretty heavy thought for a Monday. How about some boiled cabbage for lunch, Garfield.
- SWIPE!
- Or maybe some coleslaw. Now you're talking. ARF! ARF! ARF!
-
- YIP! Sad. 'ATTA BOY, GARFIELD! squeak!
- GO GET 'IM! squeak!
- Take five, little buddy. We'll make another pass in a few minutes. puff puff hee he
- HA! HA! HA! HA! Poor Lyman.
- He wouldn't be laughing so hard if he knew Odie just drank out of the toilet. Hmmm
-
-
-
- Hmmmm
- Here, Odie.
-
- YIP! YIP! YIP!
-
- GARFIELD! GET OUT OF MY SOCK DRAWER!
- CRASH!
- It's amazing the fun you can have with a hoop. Gee, I'd almost forgotten how much fun it is to hang on the old screen door.
- SLAM!
- And I'd completely forgotten about the pain. Hmmm a whistle
-
- Must be broken. Claws are great.
- They allow us cats to walk right up trees.
- There's only one problem.
- POP
- They don't call me ""Lightning Lips"" for nothing. I just want you people to know how much we cats appreciate you. Without you, who would feed us? Who would love us?
- And most important of all...
- Who would change our kitty litter? GROWL
- The cat craves fresh meat.
- What-ho, the cat senses unsuspecting quarry o'er yon knoll.
- Coiling like a spring, he prepares to lunge.
- Steely sinews propel him toward his helpless prey.
- Once again a cat's primal instincts provide sustenance. Boy, I', starved. I think I'll have sausage. hash browns and some eggs over easy.
- Good morning, Garfield. Here's tuna and liver surprise!
- The sausage and hash browns are delicious. But I do believe the eggs are a bit overdone. GASP! CHOKE! BRACK! COUGH! HACK!
- FLOP!
- Can the melodramatics, Garfield, and finish your liver. BURP!
- That was rude and crude, Garfield. Cats are more sophisticated than to submit to belching at the dinner table.
- BRAACK! Tell me what you think of my new poem, Garfield.
- ""MY BUDDY"" I have a buddy. My buddy's a toad. He's kind of muddy, he's flat on the road. But, he is my buddy, my buddy to stay, 'til he's peeled up and sailed away.
- Garfield?
- Uh-oh, here comes Jon!
- Are you hungry, Odie?
- Here, have some celery and tomatoes and radishes.
- GARFIELD! PURRRR
- PURRR
- tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity
-
- scratch! scratch! scratch! scratch!
-
- Good morning, sunshine. Welcome to another glorious, fun-filled day with your favorite pet!
- I'm so happy to own a cat, I could just throw up. Hey, Lyman. Where's my bread knife?
- SLASH!
- Never mind. This is too good to be true.
- BOING!
- That WAS too good to be true. GOBBLE! GOBBLE!
- With all respect to Will Rogers.
- I never met a lasagna I didn't like. CRASH!
- Uh-oh! Here comes Jon.
- Hello, Julie? How about a movie tonight? Oh, I see. Okay, goodbye.
- Darn, she said she was just walking out the door to visit her brother in Tokyo.
- That's what I call bad timing.
- That's called getting shot out of the saddle, you turkey. Garfield, you're getting too fat.
- I am NOT getting too fat.
- I'm just ready for the next size kitty bed, that's all. Eat up, ol' buddy.
- Hmmmm
- THIS CAT FOOD IS MADE OF: Dried whey, sodium caseinate, isolated soy protein, calcium carbonate, phosphoric acid, dicacium phosphate, corn glutein meal, wheat germ meal, brewer's dries yeast, iodized salt, ground wheat, ground corn, soybean meal, poultry by-product meal, animal fat preserved with BHA, wheat germ meal, choline chloride, citric acid, onion powder, thiamin, para aminobenzoic acid, riboflavin supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite, calcium pantothenate.
- Niacin, iron sulfate, magnesium sulfate, manganese sulfate, manganous oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide, cobalt carbonate.
- YOU WON'T GET RID OF ME THAT EASILY!
- NOW what did I do? Boy, what a great meal.
- Uh-oh!
- It was bound to happen. My stomach finally outgrew my legs.
- Worse things could happen, I guess.
- Like this, for instance. Well, you've finally done it, Garfield. Your belly's bigger than your legs. Now what are you going to do?
- I'll show you what I'm going to do.
- If you'll just roll me over to that lasagna there. You're going to have to exercise that belly off, Garfield.
- Tell you what. I'll get a leash and take you for a brisk morning drag.
- If he had a brain, I'd say he was trying to make a funny. *
-
- boing boing boing At last! My feet can touch the floor once more. Never again will I allow myself to get that fat.
- And if you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you.
-
- RIDE 'EM, COWCAT!
-
- BONK!
- OH, NO! Odie's hurt his leg! What'll I do? Shoot him. I think it's time we take Garfield and Odie out for something to do.
- Why do you say that?
- They're taking turns on the record player again. Cats can be very curious.
- SPLOOCH!
- Cats can also be very stupid. Did I ever tell you about my uncle Harry? He was a famous mouser at a glass plant in Gas City, Indiana.
- Legend has it that uncle Harry chased a mouse fight into tank #2
- Now he's a paperweight in Bayonne, New Jersey. GRAB!
- BONK!
- Smooth, move, ol' buddy. have you no respect for the dead? Hello, Carolyn? Hey, now about taking in a movie tonight? Uh...oh sure, I understand.
- She said she would love to have gone out with me tonight. click
- But she had to stay home and pluck her eyebrows. Subtle. The darn lawn mower won't work. Let me try.
-
- brrr! If I could package that look, I'd make a million. DING DONG tug tug
- Good evening, Felicia, my dear. Dinner awaits.
- A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and thou (heh-heh) Oh, brother.
-
- WAHCHOO!
- I'm allergic for cats! Either he goes or I go. SNIFF!
- POOMP!
- Gee, and she was cute, too. Salud. Oh, goody. It's Monday morning. BRING!
- I love Monday mornings. You know why?
- Because *I* don't have to go to work. Ah, six A.M. Time to rise and shine. BRING!
- First, a light breakfast of juice and toast, then some jogging.
- HA-HA-HA! That was a good one. Z
- Z smack smack
- Oh my gosh! I slept through today's strip! There's only one drawback to spending a week in bed...
- SNIFF!
- This blanket is starting to develop a personality all its own. Garfield, you've been in bed all week. Why, you could starve to death.
- Oh.
- I should have guessed as much. Get out of bed this minute, Garfield.
-
- Good boy! Darn leg cramps.
- PTOOEY!
-
- PTOOEY!
-
- PTOOEY!
- Okay, Garfield. Now give me some high lobs. Have a package of crackers, Garfield.
- RUSTLE CRACKLE CRINKLE
- They were terrible. Next time try taking them out of the wrapper. Why the droopy demeanor today, Garfield?
- KONK!
- Never say ""droop"" to a fat person. Hey, Lyman. What do you think of my new tennis racket?
- What's it strung with? Catgut.
- Aunt Reba! That's the trouble with warm weather.
- You can't keep ice cubes in your drink.
- Touch my pie and you die.
- touch
- ZOOM!!! ALWAYS RIDING THE RAGGED EDGE OF DISASTER, AREN'T YOU, GARFIELD?! Waitress, this potato is bad.
- BAD POTATO! BAD POTATO! smack! smack! smack!
- Sir, if that potato gives you any more trouble, you just let me know. There goes her tip. It's only noon, Garfield. Why don't you sleep in today, you deserve the rest.
- Hey, Garfield! Let's have some fun! I'll hold Odie down and you beat him up.
- How about some exercise, Garfield? Why don't you scratch up my favorite new chair here?
- Don't worry about knocking the plants off the shelf today, Garfield. We'll do it for you. crash! crash!
- I baked tons of lasagna for you ol' buddy. EAT! EAT!
- POOF!
- What a depressing dream. For a moment there I thought all the fun had gone out of my life. Come on, Garfield. Let's go camping. Not in your life.
- Gee, and I'd packed lots of lasagna, too.
- Since you put it that way, I reckon there's a trail or two out there that could stand a little blazing. Well, here we are in the great outdoors, Garfield.
- Ah, wilderness.
- Just us, the sky, and the trees. Where's the TV? Well, Garfield.
- What do you think of camping so far? I don't know.
- I've never been this far from the sandbox before. Why the long face, Garfield?
- Look who I brought. POOKY!
- Camping is more fun with a good friend.
- What's that?
- Must be a porcupine. GARFIELD! You're covered with porcupine quills!
- That must be very painful. I can handle it.
- ARRRRRGH! screw screw screw
- Look, Garfield! I made a kitty door for you.
-
- swing
- SMACK!
- SMASH!
- A clear-cut case of self-defense if I ever saw one. What would you like for your new birthday, Garfield? Another scratching post.
- How about a nice rubber mousie?
- Or maybe another scratching post. How'd you guess? Happy first birthday, Garfield! Make a wish and blow out the candle.
- FOOF!
- Oh gee. That's too bad. Not really. I got my wish. Have a sausage.
-
- One at a time, Garfield, one at a time. Here's to gluttony!
- GULP!
- Hello? Overeaters anonymous? Hello, Valette? Hey, how about meeting me somewhere tonight, sweets?
- You'll mee me when WHAT freezes over?
- I can take a hint! Only if it's applied with a sledgehammer. Do you know why I don't chase birds? Well, I'll tell you.
- My uncle Hubert once caught a 30-pound canary in Chicago.
- They last spotted him over Dallas, Texas. How about a snack, Garfield?
- Here's some liver left from dinner. Blech!
- It's good. Really. Watch me.
- M-m-m-m nummy nummy nummy Oh, very well.
-
- A MOUSE! GET IT!
- GARFIELD, WHY CAN'T YOU CHASE MICE LIKE OTHER CATS?
- If Jon eats one first, I'll consider it. I'm going to take you to the vet for a checkup, Garfield. OH-NO!
- My uncle Barney went to the vet once.
- He came back as my aunt Bernice. The doctor will see your cat in a moment.
- Who's next, please?
- I think I just died and went to heaven. I think I just died. I think I just died. By the way there, doc, what's your name? Liz.
- Gee, what a pretty name. Is that short for Elizabeth? No. It's short for Lizard.
- Liz must not be much for small talk. I guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other, doc. Garfield gets sick a lot. Don't you, Garfield?
- Don't you, Garfield?
- kachew kachew Well, Mr. Arbuckle, your cat's basically in good health.
- But you'll have to take better care of him. Listen to the doctor, Jon.
- He's too fat. Close your ears, boy! The woman's some kind of a quack! Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before? A rice paddy in Hong Kong?
- Look, jerk. I'll be the vet for your cat, but I won't play fall guy for your stupid lines. Understood? Uh-huh.
- So long, doctor. Have a nice day. BARK!
-
- POW! POW!
- CRACK!
- CRASH!
- GRRRR
-
- They don't tell you about these things in the pet magazines. You're too fat, Garfield.
- Why, I'll bet you haven't seen your feet in years.
- I have feet? CRUNCH
- I think it's time to put you on another diet, Garfield.
- Whatever gave him that idea? I'm starting your diet, Garfield.
- How would you like this head of cabbage prepared? Deep-fry that sucker.
- Boiled it is. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Hmmm, diet candy.
- Not bad.
- A couple more boxes of those things and I'll be skinnier than a rail. This diet I'm on has sure made me weak.
- PUNT!
- *
- Drat, he usually clears the piano. I wonder what I'd look like skinny?
-
- GARFIELD! YOUR DIET! My vanity. FOOD!
- That's this?
- I appears to be of the crescent roll family.
- A true gourmet never shies away from a new taste treat.
- (smack) A bit dry, but palatable.
- Garfield, have you seen my sweat socks? Cats are the world's greatest tree climbers.
- There's only one tiny problem...
- Cats are also the world's worst tree climber downers. I've made up my mind. The only way out of this tree is to jump. I may break every bone in my body, but here goes.
-
- There again... Catch the rope, Garfield!
- Now tie it around your waist and I'll pull you down. HA-HA-HA!
- I'll get Jon for that. I've come to rescue you, Garfield.
- Uh-oh.
- Well, this is just ducky. There's only one way out of this tree, Garfield.
- We'll have to jump.
- Gee, I'd love to but I simply haven't a thing to wear to our funeral. Either we jump, or we'll starve up here, Garfield. I'm with you.
- GERONIMO!!
- Ahem...me, me, meee
- MEYOWRRR
- BONK
- I wonder if this is how Enrico Caruso got his start.
- MEYOWRRRR
- CLOBBER!!
- clink clink clank
- MEYOWRR bink ZOOM!
- Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, do cats do these things? I'm getting out of this tree if it kills me
-
- POOMP!
- Gee, that didn't hurt at all. What are you doing with the ice pick, Garfield?
- stab stab stab stab stab
- The only way to eat peas. Oh. Well, hello there, good-looking.
- Say, what're you doing tonight?
- How about coming to my place for dinner? Say, how about popping over to my place for a late-night snack?
- Ha-ha-ha. You needn't be afraid of little ol' me.
- If you like, you can bring a friend and we'll have dessert, too. I'm sorry. We don't serve cats here.
-
- What will you and your dog have, sir? GO GET 'IM, GARFIELD!
-
- Opps! SQUEAK!
- Everyone stand back! Give him some air!
- Artificial respiration might help.
- Okay, go, boy!
- Phew! For a minute there I thought I was out of a job. Come on, Garfield. Let's go see your vet.
- She sure is cute.
- Why is every time HE gets a hot flash, I have to go to the doctor? How about a date, doc? I'd sooner die.
- Well don't do *that*.
- Nothing like a snappy comeback to save face. How about a date, sweetheart?
- That's *doctor' to you.
- Okay, how about a date, *doctor' sweetheart? Tell me, doc.
- Do you make house calls?
- It's not the veterinary medicine I mind. It's some of the animals I have to work with.
- Tell me, doctor, what do you suggest for an animal who's madly in love?
- I usually prescribe neutering. We'll make an appointment for Garfield's next checkup in about six months.
- What if there's an emergency? Then you can call me day or night.
- Come on, Garfield. Let's go home and play in traffic. That's not funny.
- CRASH!
- SMASH!
- leap!
- SPLAT! Take that!
- ZOOM!
- How do they know when it's bath day? BATH TIME!
- chuckle chuckle
- Okay, who put oatmeal in the soapbox? Well, sprinkle me with brown sugar and call me for breakfast. Why can't you be like other cats, Garfield?
- Let me explain the basic differences between humans and cats.
- Well, make it snappy. I have a tennis lesson in half an hour. Time for a midnight snack.
- crinkle
- boing boing boing
- BOING BOING BOING
- BOING BOING Help! For staying out of my food today, Garfield, I'm going to reward you with a kitty munchie.
-
- They're gone. I already rewarded myself.
-
-
-
- What say I switch over the movie, gang?
- Nah. Grrr. Ffft.

- Get it. Hmmm a doggie biscuit.

- SMACK!
- And then there's Garfield. Hmm

- Yesterday I stuffed Odie's nose in his mouth.
- You should have seen him...
- Running around in little circles going ""Mark! Mark! Mark!"" Oh boy, what a night. I ate too much, I drank too much, and I danced half the night.
- You're lucky you're a cat, Garfield. You don't have to put up with all that.
- RUB IT IN, WHY DON'T YOU?! YAWN! yawn!
- LA LA LA mrow
-
-
-
- stroke stroke stroke
- Come on, Garfield, let's go jogging. Have a good time. Have you ever thought about meeting some nice girl cat and settling down, Garfield? Not really.
- We boy cats cherish our bachelorhood.
- Why, I come from a long line of bachelors.
-
- Oh, by the way, Garfield.
- CRASH!
- I waxed the TV today. Hey, Garfield, how would you like to go jogging? How would you like me to shred your shorts?
- Some nerve.
- Show me a jogger and I'll show you a strange person with a thing for pain.
-
- You win. You were uglier to begin with. I'm never taking you golfing again, Garfield. Big deal.
- I've never been so embarrassed.
- I can't believe what you did at the seventeenth green. Sand trap, sandbox, what's the difference? We're going for a walk, Garfield. I HATE leashes.
- Heh, heh, taking your pet for a stroll through the park is a great way to meet chicks. grrr ffft
- ROWRR!
- What kind of a JERK would walk his cat on a leash? rowr!
- rowr! ffft! yip! yip! yip!
- Back to the drawing board. Say, you look like you want to go jogging this morning, Garfield. You are wrong, sweat sock breath.
- Jogging is fine for some people, I suppose...
- But I've never been that crazy about the dry heaves. KERCHUNK!
- A new world's record.
- When was the last time you stuck 44 keys on a typewriter?
- Oh, great.
- Garfield ate my toothpaste again. I just LOVE to court danger.
- SPLOOSH!
- Yipeee, ha-ha, wheee. This is my pet ant, Lyle. He's cute, quiet, and industrious.
- SPLAT!
- The ""late"" Lyle was also eyeballing my lasagna.
- What?! Where?!
- He did it again. Oh, Garfield.
- We're going on a trip, Garfield. So just hop into your new kitty carrier here.
- OH-NO!
- Not THE BOX!!!
-
- Let me put it to you this way. Before we go on the the trip, one of us is going to have to get into this kitty carrier. Well, why didn't you say so?
- SCUFFLE SCUFFLE STRUGGLE GRAB! STUFF STUFF Guess what, Garfield? While mom and dad're on a week's vacation, we're going to baby-sit for their kitten.
- Meet Nermal.
- Wake me in a week. I gotta spend a week wet-nursing Nermal, here...he's cute.
- And I hate ""cute"".
- Don't knock it, jack, I make a killing posing for greeting cards. Okay, Nermal. There's a dog. ...KILL!
-
- Oh, Nermal, Nermal, Nermal, Nermal. CRUD!
- Nermal shed all over my food.
- I can't stand cat hairs unless they're my own.
- Take those roller skates off, Garfield. You look ridiculous.
- Nermal's leaving now. Wave bye-bye, Garfield.
- I kind of liked the little feller.
- The way I like intestinal flu.
- SPLOOSH!
- OH-NO! A vicious undertow is dragging me out to sea!
- I'M TOO YOUNG TO GO!
- I can see the headlines now...""WORLD FAMOUS CAT LOST AT SEA. MILLIONS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRL CATS GRIEF-STRICKEN!""
- I can't make it! I'm going down for the third time!
- I'd save you, Garfield. But I'm not about to give a cat mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. YAWN
- Oh, this looks like a nice place to sleep.
- If you don't mind, Garfield... SACK! PILLAGE! MAIN! DESTROY!
- BONK!
- Whimper, limp, cry, hurt, moan... It's time to put your leash on for a nice walk.
- Oh, come on, Garfield. It's not that bad.
- I know you don't like your leash, Garfield, but people are staring.
- So cut that out.
- Odie, you know better than that.
- Do you know what I appreciate about you most, Garfield?
- I'm housebroken. You're housebroken. Some people say pets are not clean.
- That may be so.
- But try eating your next meal without your hands and see how well YOU fare.
- SMACK MUNCH SLURP
- CLICK!
- ZZZ
- zzz
- I didn't know cats could eat in their sleep.
- But I DO KNOW they can't sharpen their claws in their sleep. I shouldn't have pushed it. Attention, America! I am hereby declaring this week NATIONAL FAT WEEK.
- This is the week for all you fat people to come out of the closet.
- Those of you who could get into one, that is. This is National Fat Week. I want to hear all you fat people say, ""I'm fat, and I'm proud of it!""
- LOUSER! ""I'M FAT, AND I'M PROUD OF IT!""
- You...the pudgy one in Seattle, I didn't hear you. Here's a National Fat Week handy fat tip.
- ""Don't exercise."" You'll be happier.
- Have you ever seen a jogger laugh? Here's a National Fat Week skinny joke.
- How many skinny people does it take to fill a shower?
- I don't know. They keep slipping down the drain. Here's the National Fat Week ""weight-height chart"".
- According to this, if you weigh 200 pounds, you should be 6'4"".
- That means if you're under 6'4"" you're not overweight, you're undertall. Well, fat brothers and sisters, this is the last day of National Fat Week.
- Just remember ""Round is Beautiful"".
- Now get out there and eat a chicken franchise. CARTOONIST'S NOTE: Today's Garfield strip is to be read only by fat people, or people with fat tendencies, you skinny ones can read the other strips, or jog, or drink a glass of water, or whatever it is skinny people do. ...I wouldn't know.
- I am hereby declaring this coming week ""NATIONAL FAT WEEK"".
- OUT OF THE CLOSET, YOU FATTIES!
- This week we're going to eat without guilt.
- Remember our slogan: ""If it's not deep-fried, it's not worth eating.""
- We'll boycott carrots and tell skinny jokes.
- I would have had a national convention.
- But I couldn't get the Kansas City stockyards to cater it. Be careful there, Garfield.
- Hanging on the drapes can be very painful.
- 'CAUSE I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR LEGS IF YOU DON'T GET OFF THEM THIS INSTANT! GASP! CHOKE! WHEEZE!
- Oh no you don't, Garfield.
- So much for the old !play-sick-and-grab-the-chicken-when-your-owner-calls-the-vet"" routine. GARFIELD! BREAKFAST!
- BONK!
- I did it again. I got up before I woke up. wag wag wag
- STOMP!
- WAG WAG WAG
- MEYOW
- Let me guess, you were in the pickled herring again. Eat up, Garfield. Meyow.
- It says here this is a ""new improved"" cat food. munch munch
- MEYOW!

-
- Oh, darn!
- Jon's flower garden got a little over-frolicked. We're going to see your veterinarian today, Garfield.
- She's one cute chicky-boo. I'd marry her in a second.
- It's comforting to know the high values placed on the sacred institution of marriage are still with us today. In a half-second!
- That Liz is sure a great looking hunk of veterinarian.
- She has the one quality I desire most in a woman. She's breathing. Be right with you, Mr. Arbuckle.
- I'll be here with bells on, doctor. That makes for an interesting mental picture.
- Why does she always put me down? You're so putdownable. How about going out with me, doctor? I wouldn't go out with you if you were the last man on earth.
-
- Then how about sometime after that? That's a good one. Why won't you go out with me, doctor? Because I hate your guts.
-
- Does this mean marriage is out of question? Don Quixote strikes again. How about a date, doc? No way.
- Mmmm
- Great! See you at eight. If you can't convice'm, confuse'm. Caution
- Hmmm, wet cement.
- SPLUT! OOPS!
-
-
- BARK! BARK! slurp
- Lassie would have gone for help. I suppose you want to know how my date went with Liz, the vet...well, don't ask. I won't.
- She didn't show. Old Jon just stood up. I don't want to hear about it.
- You know, Garfield. I like you better than people. Tell me more. munch munch munch
- SMACK! SLURP! GOBBLE!
- My aunt Evelyn is the neatest cat I know.
- She plucked all the hair off her body so she wouldn't shed on the furniture.
- Now she's living with a family in L.A. that thinks she's a Chihuahua. YIP! YIP! YIP!
- YIP! YIP! YIP!
- For the last time, Odie, YOU chase the TAIL. Garfield, must you do everything I do?
- That wasn't very nice.
- After all, cats are just little people with fur and fangs.
- SHOOP! fwip fwip fwip fwip fwip fwip
- A Venetian tongue. WAKE UP, SLEEPYHEAD!
- We're having breakfast on the patio this morning.
- Because I want to share this beautiful sunrise with you.
- Where else can you find a living, breathing work of art created just for you ? fresh with the promise of a bright new day.
- Have you ever seen a more glorious sight, Garfield? ...uh, Garfield?
- Get the face out of the scrambled eggs, Garfield. Bath time, Garfield.

- Foul! Foul! No fair! Foul! Mornin'. Good morning, Irma.
- The coffee's strong, Hon, You'd better get it before it gets you. Is it hot?
- Yup. This isn't one of your better diners. My, you look nice today, Irma. Are you kidding?
- When I come to work I wear base and lipstick and that's it, Hon. I don't put on eyes unless I have a hot date. You know what I mean?
- I didn't even shave my legs. This definitely isn't one of your better diners.
- Boy, am I bored.
- Bored, bored, bored, bored.
-
- ARGHHH!
- I feel better already.
- SMACK!
- I hate patio doors.
- Hey, Garfield, where's Odie? He's easy enough to find.
- Just follow the slobber.
- Ingredient: gunk
- I suspected as much.
- For the last time, NO, Garfield.
- What's the problem?
- He wants to see a wine list. You may have the leftovers when I'm through, Garfield.
- KONG!
- You don't have to be patient when you're as big as I am. Are you still having breakfast?
- You've spent an hour eating your cereal.
- You know I don't like raisins.
- slit!
-
- munch smack slurp
- ptooey!
- burp
-
- Garfield went to so much trouble I hated to spoil it for him. Good boy, Garfield. Give me the paper.
- Either I get breakfast or you'll never see this paper alive again.
- WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A STRING ATTACHED?! Nothing's free, pal.
- FLIP!
- I can take a hint. I have something for that appetite of yours, Garfield.
- Close your eyes and open your mouth.
- Here's a handy hint for you bachelors out there.
- You can keep your laundry detergent dry.
- By sealing it in a cookie jar. Let's go see the vet, Garfield.
-
- I have a ten o'clock appointment. Veterinary Clinic
- Here, Petey. Here, Petey. Where are you?

- Good idea.
- I could use the rest. We have a long way to go, Garfield.
- I wish you enjoyed riding in a car more.
- You're too tense. I'd like a room for the night.
- Any pets? Nope.
-
- Look at that, Garfield, What do you...
- ...uh, think. When I think of sand, I think of sun, surf and getting a good tan.
- What do you think of when you think of sand, Garfield?
- On second thought, scratch that question. Fred's Fresh Fish

-
- Thank you so much for your prompt reply.
-
- Nice try, hot shot. How's your coffee, hon? It's a bit strong.
- SAY IT'S NOT SO! SAY IT'S NOT SO! I COULD JUST SHOOT MYSELF!
- You usually don't find one that dedicated. It's her life. I hate it when Garfield falls asleep in my lap. zzz
- He snuggles up. zzz

- CLOBBER!
- Love is a fickle thing. ah-ah-ah
- AHCHOOO!
- sniff Scratch the sofa all you like, Garfield.
- Reverse psychology.
- Reverse reverse psychology. It's time you started taking vitamins, Garfield. No way, pal. My body's a temple.
- I put them in this lasagna.
- Even a temple needs his vitamin C. Doesn't it bother you that your cat is always underfoot?
- Not at all. Garfield is very fond of me.
- We're inseparable, aren't we, Garfield? You're standing on my tail. I often wonder what goes on in that complex mind of yours, Garfield. bzzzzzzzzzzzzz
- Wouldn't it be wonderful if humans and animals could communicate? smack!
- What would you say to me if you could talk right now? I just killed a fly somewhere on your raisin toast. That's a nasty cold you have there, Garfield. SNIFF
- We'll take you to the vet and get you fixed right up.
- Never say ""fixed"" to an animal person. There's nothing like a brisk morning jog in thermal underwear.
- Hmmm, a thread.
-
-
-
- SLAM
- Very funny, Garfield. Get off the ceiling, Garfield.
- Get out of the glove compartment, Garfield.
- Get back in the glove compartment, Garfield.
-
- Get your face off the windshield, Garfield. What is it, Garfield? What are you trying to tell me?
- Oh.
- You're carsick, you say.
-
- Stop playing with the power seat, Garfield. Dinner's on, Garfield. We have lasagna and chicken and mashed potatoes.
- Let's see, I think I'll have...
- A peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Well, Garfield, that's the last time the Hamiltons ever ask us over.
- I hope you learned a lesson from this evening. I sure did.
- Never sharpen your claws on a water bed.
- Have you ever noticed how much some people look like their pets, Garfield?
- Hee hee Hee
- HA-HA-HA ha
-
- Guess who's come to visit us this week, Garfield?
- NERMAL! The world's cutest kitten.
- You're testing me, aren't you?! How cute!
-
- How cute! hop hop hop
- BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
- Somehow, Garfield, your grasp of ""cute"" is a little shaky. scratch! scratch! scratch! scratch!
- There's one nice thing about having another cat around the house.
- NERMAL! I'm tired of competing with that Nermal. I think I'll give him a good pounding today.
- Where is that little fuzzball= He could be anywhere.
- It's time we determined who's master of this household.
- SMACK!
- How did he do that? ***
-
-
-
-
- Would you like to come in, Garfield?

- I'll lay you ten to one I'm here till saturday. What a bummer. Here I am wrapped up in a window blind.
- Just bump in the road of destiny, just a hump on the camel of fate, just a lump in the throat of misfortune.
- Hey! You DO have to suffer to write! If I expand the muscles in my body, maybe I can burst my way out of this blind.
- DRAT! I forgot.
- What muscles?
-
- I was afraid of that. Hey, Garfield.
- What are you doing up there?
- In a world full of idiots, I get the grand high llama. Let me get you out of that blind, Garfield.
-
-
-
-
- Uh-oh! Here comes Jon!
- The perfect crime.
- Oh, Garfield.
- Have you perchance, seen my chicken? Just one bite of chicken and that's it, Garfield.
-
- If you swallow, I'll tie a knot in your neck. Whatever your beliefs, the Christmas season represents peace, love and charity among people everywhere.
- Merry Christmas and season's greetings.
- Sometimes I'm so sentimental I could just kiss myself. I froze a special treat for you, Garfield.
- Oh, goody.
- Cat food on a stick. It's true cats always land on their feet.
-
- The things I do for this strip.
- Spiders are curious insects to see. Their webs are really neat.
- But how do they weave them elaborately, When all they have is feet? Garfield and I can actually communicate. Watch this...
- Would you like to take a bath, Garfield?
- Garfield says ""no"". CRASH!
- GARFIELD! YOU BROKE MY FERN!!
- I RAISED THAT FERN FROM A FROND!
- WHAT DID THAT FERN EVER DO TO YOU?!!
- Why, I have a notion to...uh...to

- To be nicer to dogs...
- And to sprout wings and fly. So this is 1980.

- Feels about the same. You're a sweet cat, Garfield.
- It's time we did more things together.
- LIKE GIVE YOU A BATH! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! Darn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!
- Never have so few given so much to so many.
- Quit dawdling, Garfield. How dare you to speak that way to the president of the United States. Just as I suspected.
- The floor is freezing.
- clop! clop!

- Back off, Garfield. That turkey leg is for my lunch.
- ACHOO!

- Would you like a turkey leg, Garfield? Only if you don't want it. SLURP!
- The coffee's too hot, Garfield.
- Thanks for telling me. What would you like for breakfast, Garfield? Something different!
- The usual, you say? NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
- One usual coming up! It's things like this that contribute to the high suicide rate among cats.
- PUNT! YIP!
- Throw me a roll, Jon.
- GULP!
- PASS me a roll, Jon. How many times have I told you not to beg at the table?
- Sometimes Odie is a real problem.
- I wish I had your problem. Oh, no, Garfield. You're not getting my chicken today.

- FOOMP!
- It's the sparks I'm not too fond of. GARFIELD! LUNCH TIME!
-
- I hate it when my feet go to sleep. Frank, meet Garfield. Hi, Garfield.
- ROWRRRR!
- Some people rub me the wrong way. Let's talk about dogs...what are dogs?
-
- Are they vegetable or mineral? Garcon, I'll have the escargot and truffles for an appetizer, then the duck a l'orange flambe and some cappuccino.
- Eat up, pal.
- Talk about lowering one's sights... Here's your coffee, hon.
- CRASH!
- The roller skating craze is getting out of hand. Let's tighten that leash, Garfield. I hate leashes.

- Uh, sir? Pardon me ma'am...hey you there... uh...
- SLAM Hi, Jon. Hi, Lyman.
- What took you so long?
- I had to drag myself home with my lips. Morning, Liz. Jon here. I'm bringing Garfield in for a checkup today.
- I know you've been wanting to get to know me better, so why don't you make it a late appointment and we'll go to dinner afterward.
- Jon...Jon Arbuckle. Hi, doctor? Remember me? Jon? Your knight in shining armor?
- Oh yes, I remember.
- Names escape me, but I never forget a twit. In order to become a veterinarian, you must have a good mind for a woman.
- I have a good mind for a man.
- You also have a great boy for a man. How about a date, Liz?
- Could you make it through the night if I said no? Yes.
- No. When it comes to slow wits, Jon is a genius. Say, ""Ah,"" Garfield.
- I'll take your temperature if you don't say, ""Ah"".
- Ah. I know you're just a veterinarian, Liz, but I've had these dizzy spells lately...
- Well now, why don't we just check your blood pressure.
- Uh...DOCTOR. Oh, boy, it is chilly this morning.

- How do you know that?
- I have my ways. Here's a picture of Garfield at the zoo.
- Here's Garfield sitting next to a very rare $200 parrot.
- Here's a picture of me shelling out 300 bucks for Garfield's lunch. Help yourself, Garfield.
-
- Would you like a little coffee in that sugar? This should blow Jon's mind. Me, Garfield, being nice to Odie. pat pat
- Heh heh, nice. pat pat
- THAT WAS a JOKE, YOU TWIT.

- This table wasn't big enough for the both of us. POOMP!

- A little more to the right, Garfield.
- Watch this. I'm going to swing down on this vine and swoop up Jon's chicken.
- YANK YANK
-
- SWOOP!
- Where did the vine come from? Guess what, Garfield? This week we're going to visit dad and mom on the farm.
- Yipee skip.
- I think I'll call in sick this week. There's only one thing you have to remember when we get to the farm, Garfield.
- Watch where you step.
- Let me out. Hi, dad. Welcome hom, city boy.
- Hi, mom. EAT, EAT, EAT, EAT.
- Well, shucky darn and slop the chickens, I think I'm going to like it here. EAT, EAT, EAT. Mom, is that all you can say? ""Eat, eat, eat""?
- You should meet some nice girl, settle down, have a family.
- Pass the mashed potatoes. EAT, EAT, EAT. How's Garfield adjusting to the farm? OINK!
- You mean, how's the farm adjusting to Garfield. I'm glad we visited the farm, dad. Yup.
- It's nice to get away from it all. Yup.
- Way, way, wayyyy away.

-
-
- This would be a good morning for a brisk walk.
-
- To the food dish.
- CLACK!
- Life wasn't half as much fun before I got my yo-yo bone. The caped avenger sees an evil dog.
- The caped avenger springs into action.
- The caped avenger hurts himself.
- SWIPE!
- Thanks, Garfield. I hate to lick stamps. Bluh, bluh. We're having lasagna for dinner tonight, Garfield.
- PLTOOEY!
- What say I bake it first. What say. I could use a good back walk, Garfield.
- This is great. You'd make someone a good wife.
- NO CLAWS! NO CLAWS!
-
-
-
-
- It's not the having, it's the getting. You're too fat, Garfield. I'm putting you on another diet.
- He makes me so mad.
- If I could have gotten up on that chair, I would have given him the beating of his life. Here's a carrot for your diet, Garfield. You know what to do with it.
- I certainly do.
- Here, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit. I know you're unhappy, Garfield, but I wouldn't have to put you on diets if you wouldn't eat so much.
- I can't help it. I have a glandular condition...
- An overactive mouth gland. This diet's a real bummer. I'm getting weaker by the minute.
- I must be going into cholesterol withdrawal.
- That's when you have the urge to make a highball out of bacon grease. B-R-R-R-R
- Awwww, poor thing. First you're on a diet, now you're freezing.
- Where's your blanket? I ate it. You're looking trimmer, Garfield. I'll take you off your diet now.
-
- WHEW! POOMP!
-
-
- Oh no, you don't, Garfield. This chicken leg is mine.
-
-
-
- Let's hear it it for claws. Gee, I feel good.
- I feel like being nice to everybody today.
- I must be coming down with something. Heh heh
- Cats love to play in grocery bags.
- Darn...no groceries. When the newspaper comes each day, I take the editorial page and Jon takes the funnies.
- HA! HA! HA! HA!
- There's no accounting for some people's taste.
- SWIPE!
- Let me guess...you're hungry. Right on. Come on , kitty. Sing your song.
-
- Doo-da, doo-da. OH NO!
- PUNT!
- Don't laugh. How would you like to have dog drool all over YOUR teddy bear?
-

-
-
- Graceful. Blow it out your ear. This looks like it's going to be a good week.
-
- Nuts...nuts, nuts, nuts. meyow

- Is that all I am to you? Merely an obstruction in the road of life. I know you cats are inquisitive by nature, Garfield.
- And I know this is your home as well as mine...
- BUT STAY OUT OF MY UNDERWEAR DRAWER!! Computers...everything is controlled by computers these days.
- That chicken you ate was even raised by a computer.
- *b*u*r*p* Let's go eat, Odie.
- What say you go formal.
- With a white tie and tail. It's a myth that cats are high-strung.
- BARK
- There's a lot of truth in those old myths. Have a fish, Garfield.
-
-
- GULP
- PTOOEY
- THAT WAS AMAZING! I have nimble teeth. Guess what, Garfield? I'm entering you in a cat show.
- That should be fun...
- I'll be dynamite in the swimsuit competition. You'll have to take a bath before the cat show, Garfield. I'll take my chances.
- Clean cats are winning cats.
- The things I do for stardom. Now let's fluff you up.
- rrrrrr
- We need a gimmick for the cat show, Garfield, something to make the judge notice you.
- This should do it.
- It's a sad state of affairs when a pet owner stoops to humiliating a cat. They'll probably want you to do tricks at the show, Garfield, so hop through this hoop.
-
- I could just cry. Hurry up, Garfield! Time to leave for the cat show. grrr rowr
- YIP! ROWR! FFT!
- I could just cry. This is it, Garfield, your first cat show.
- Where do I put my cat? Put him here.
-
-
- Is this the cat show?
- Yes it is.
- But the DOG show is NEXT week. I'd like to enter Garfield in the cat show. Okay.
- Hmmm, lesee here, hmmm.
- I'm sorry, but we don't have a ""fat"" division. Let me at him! Hi, what have you got there?
- This is Monarch, a registered ruddy abyssinian. He's in the grand champion division with 1400 CFA points...what's that?
- This is Garfield. He's...uh sort of yellowish orange and he's got stripes. I've never been so embarrassed. Cat shows are disgusting.
- Imagine, pitting one cat another on a physical basis. This is all so phony.
- Judge Cat Show
-
- Darned if my competitive nature didn't get the best of me again. And the winner of the household cat division is...
- GARFIELD!
- Congratulations, Garfield! Did you ever think you could win a cat show? Does a baby go goo? I've solved the case, captain. The murderer is...
- We interrupt this program to tell you there's a thunderstorm coming into the area.
- How dare they break into my favorite TV show for a weather report!
- I'm calling the station to give them a piece of my mind!
- Boy, am I hot!
- W-N-R-D, hello? MEOW!
- Is this some sort of a joke? Hello?
- Boy, do I feel dumb.
- BONK!
- Garfield hates mondays. I hate mondays. You're great, Garfield.
- You're warm, furry, cuddly, and...
- If you say ""cute"" I'll scratch your eyes out.
-
- I think I'll step into the next room and have a nervous breakdown. What's warm and fun to lie in...
- And must be chased, but can't be caught?
-
- Okay, Garfield. What've you done?
- WHAT'VE YOU DONE?! WHAT'VE YOU DONE?! I love mental games. plip!
- plip!
- I don't like raisins in my cereal. plip! I KNOW! I KNOW!
- Leave that chicken leg alone, Garfield. It's mine.
-
- SMACK!
-
- WHACK! SPLAT!
- It's things like this that tend to diminish my enthusiasm for a cat. Uh-oh, Garfield wants in! tap tap
- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- When I want in, I want in NOW. TWEET TWEET
- SPROING!
- VARRROOM! B-B-B-B-VOOM! BAROOM!
- meyow
- VROWMMM! SCREEEE! VOOM! VOOM! Television should be more informative. Television should be more intellectually stimulating.
- I'm going to start a movement for more socially aware TV programming!
- Just as soon as I'm finished watching ""The Beach Creature Annoys Sandra Dee"".
- I think you're missing the point of our walks, Garfield.
- Hey there, good-looking. I don't believe I've seen you around here before.
- Do you believe in love at the first sight?
- Where have you been all my life? I'm bored.
- I'm sick of being cooped up in this house all day.
- LET ME OUT! I NEED SPACE!
-
-
-
- How about a date. doc? Okay.
- Are you going out with me because of my charm, or my good looks?
- It must be your charm. Bingo. You're not going to stand me up again, are you, doc? Really...why are you going out with me?
- You amuse me.
- I'll settle for that. Don Juan dazzles another love-struck waif. This is is great. I have a date with Liz. I'll finally have her all to myself.
- Just her and me.
- And kitty makes three. What do you have planned for us tonight?
- First we'll jet to a Hollywood premiere and reception with the stars. Then have an intimate dinner at a posh restaurant followed by an evening of dancing at a private club topped off with bubbly on the beach at sunrise.
- You're kidding! Yea... Yes...how does a drive-in movie grab you? What's the movie tonight? The Sludge Monster Meets Vermin Man.
- Never heard of it.
- We've seen it eight times. Go Sludge Monster! Thanks for going out with me tonight, Liz. I'm sorry Garfield came along. He's a little overbearing at times.
- But, at any rate...I'd like to...uh...it was...I mean...er...uh...
- Kiss her, you dip.
- Stand aside, little lady, I'll stop the traffic for you.
- HOLD UP!
-
- VOOM!
- My hero.
- Face it, Garfield...
- You aren't the kitten you once were. I'm making some really great soup for supper, Garfield. Something's wrong here.
- And now some seasoning... I don't like the sound of this.
- BATH TIME! I've been duped again!I'm really going to get you clean today, Garfield.
- scrub scrub scrub scrub
- What's this? One of my stripes, you bimbo.
- DON'T GO OUTSIDE!
- I just mowed the lawn! Eat up, Pal.
- I won't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on a ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death.
- SPLAT!
-
- I must speak to Jon about changing the water in my bowl.
-
- What's happening?
- I have no urge to shove Odie off the table!
- I'm losing my touch!
- I must be having an attack of nice!
- PUSH
- With self-control you can conquer anything. Guess who's come to visit? Nermal, the world's cutest kitten.
- You're so cute it's disgusting! That's true.
- But it's a cross I'll just have to bear. How come I've known you a year, Nermal, and you're still a tiny kitten?
- I think small.
- And the coffee and cigarettes don't hurt. Hee, hee, hee.
- Here, Nermal. Have a steak.
- You really trade on cute, don't you? I manage. You're too cute, Nermal.
- CUTE IS TASTELESS! CUTE ROTS THE INTELLECT! So what's so hot about ugly?
- Good point.
- Psst, hey, fella. Wanna buy a kitten?
- What the? Black market kittens. I'll make a killing. Hey, Nermal, do you think you could teach me to be cute, too?
- Sure. First, open your eyes just as wide as you can.
- Now lose about 20 pounds. Very funny. YAWN!
- YAWN
- YAWN
-
-
-
- YAWN!
-
- Now where could my rubber mousie be?
- EIYEEEEE! SPLASH!
- That's right. I left it in the bathtub. I LOVE LASAGNA!
- I love to smear it on my body.
- Which insures I don't have to share it with anyone.
-
- I bet you didn't know cats can shed at will. Garfield! Why would you ever want to catch that fish?
- Some people LOVE cats for what they are...
- And some people ARE cats for what they LOVE.
-
- What's the matter, Jon? Cat got your tongue? You might thay that. MERORRR

- Now drain your spaghetti with it. gasp struggle wheeze
- Lasagna! I need lasagna!
- Let's talk about this pasta dependency of yours, Garfield. First, a noodle, then we talk. I'll just take the last helping of lasagna, Garfield.
- And you may do whatever you wish with the pan, ha-ha.
- WHANG! SPLAT! I'm getting tired of your string-arm tactics around here, Garfield.
- Remember: blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

- I'm going to train you to sit up today. It's hard to teach a dead dog new tricks. Some people say I'm mean to Odie. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE dogs. And if I'm lying, may lightning...
-
- Strike the dog next door. kerow! yip! To properly enjoy tennis you must have the correct stance.

- Time to put you out, Garfield.
- I don't wanna go out!
-
- SLAM!
-
- It's that time of year again.
- ""hen my animal instincts send me into the wild for forage for food.
- And the girl scouts start carrying cookies. Come on, girl scout. Come to Garfield.
- B-B-B-B-B EEEK!
- Darn. I was hoping for chocolate chip. Hey, mister, your cat ate all my girl scout cookies.
- How do you know it was MY cat who ate your cookies?
- Twelve boxes worth? That's my cat. o-o-o-o I'm very disappointed of you, Garfield.
- I can't believe you mugged a girl scout for her cookies.
- So cancel my good conduct medal. In one ear, and out the other. Oh goody. Here come more girl scouts with more cookies!
- Rats!
- They have a Den Mother riding point. Here comes another girl scout. Watch this.
- Beat it, cat! bonk!

- SLURP!
- Yuk
- Look, Odie...me cat, you dog, we fight. That's the order of things.
- Understand?
- SLURP!
- The jungle cat awakes with a voracious appetite.
- He instinctively sets out to slay some breakfast.
- That wasn't very pretty, but it's all part of the food chain. The alley cat scrounges for food.
- He pokes his head into a promising garbage can.
- PEEEYEWWW! The wild cat stalks the environs in search of prey.
- He attacks a helpless chicken.
- A big, BIG only semi-helpless chicken. The farm cat sets out to patrol his property.
- He happens upon a plot of fresh catnip.
- And wakes up the next morning in Atlantic City with a Barbie doll. The actor cat is being filmed escaping from the enemy.
- He must leap off a cliff to complete the escape.
- Which, of course, is done by a stunt dog. The house cat has a busy schedule.
- What with sharpening claws.
- And seeing his owner off on a big night. poke poke poke
- poke poke poke poke I'm hungry.
- Garfield, you know how I hate it when you poke me. poke poke poke
- poke poke poke poke Then feed me.
- How would you like it if I poked you?! POKE!
- POKE! POKE! POKE! POKE! POKE! POKE! It's things like that, that make me glad I'm a dog owner. I'm hungry. What would you like for your birthday, Garfield? Another nine lives.
- How about a ball of yarn? How about not?
- What if I keep you in kitty sweaters? What if I keep you in stitches? In two days I'll be two years old...that's fourteen years in human terms.
- I can't wait.
- In another four months I'll be old enough to drive. Tomorrow, I'll be two years of age. That's the human equivalent of fourteen.
- Cats have it good.
- Adolescence without acne. Today is my birthday, and I hate birthdays. I'm going to get a surprise party, and I hate surprise parties.
- SURPRISE, GARFIELD!
- But I LOOOOVE the attention! BARK! SPLAT!
- For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

- I don't know why I did that.
- I guess it comes naturally to a knee-jerk dog hater.
-
- POOF I have a tabby at home just like you.

- Ha-ha, ""Sludge Monster"" indeed. How trite.
- Oh no! My food has been ransacked! This looks like the work of the ...SLUDGE MONSTER!
- Keep a cool head, Garfield. You must not panic.
- AYIEEE! Burp. I must arm myself against the sludge monster.
- Ah! A helmet.
- I should have dumped the sugar out first. You may ask...why do I fear the sludge monster?
- Not only does it have a bad complexion and dominate the conversation at social gatherings...
- It also feeds on scratching posts. OH NO! HERE COMES THE SLUDGE MONSTER!
- ARRGH!
- I wish you'd curb that imagination of yours, Garfield. There it is!
- PREPARE TO MEET YOUR MAKER, SLUDGE MONSTER!
- Why did you mangle that liver, Garfield? In the interest of national security, sir.

- Frailty, thy name is dog. It's Monday, Garfield. What are you going to do today?
- What everyone should do on Monday.
- Sleep until Tuesday. So this is Tuesday.
- Do you know what I like most about Tuesday?
- It's not Monday.

- GARFIELD!
- Don't take another step! This chicken is loaded! It's another brand new day for Garfield, the biggest, baddest, meanest cat in the land.
- And his sidekick, Pooky.
- The biggest, baddest, meanest teddy bear.
-
-
-
- Pooky! Speak to me! Are you okay, fella? Hey, Bobby Baby! What's happenin'?
- You say I got a wrong number? Well for a wrong number you sure have a sexy voice. Who is this?
- Oh, hi, mom. Embarrassment City.
- SPLASH!
-
-
- I'd better go up for air.
- GASP! Garfield, how would you like to be my attack cat? Me? An attack cat?
- You'd be my side thwarting danger. I'd be your side thwarting danger.
- Attacking anyone threatening. Attacking anyone edible. I have constructed a thug-dummy for your attack training, Garfield.
- KILL!
- HA-HA-HA HA-HA! Remember, Garfield, you're a vicious attack cat.
- ATTACK!
- Your mother wears combat boots. You're an attack cat. Kill the dummy. Kill the dummy.
- KILL!
- Wring dummy. Then be more specific. Okay, attack cat, let's say a mugger jumps out of the bushes.
- A 300-pound mugger with a club.
- How will we ever protect ourselves? He's not after MY wallet, jack. Forget it, Garfield. You'll never make a good attack cat.
- Oh yeh? Well just let some brute try to mug Jon.
- I'll give him the hissing of his life.
-
-
-
- GARFIELD! BATH TIME!
- ZOOM! Cats.
-
- How about some breakfast, Garfield? That would be great. What did you do with the chicken, Garfield?
- SPEAK UP!
- I'm sorry, Garfield. Sometimes I forget you can't talk. Forget this. You're looking a little puny, Garfield.
- Why don't we go see the lady vet again?
- Then why don't WE ask the lady vet out again? Than why don't WE get shot out of the saddle again? Hey, doc, how about another date?
- I don't know. I don't feel safe about you, big fella.
- I might yawn myself to death. That put-down gets a 9.8. hop hop
- That's the thing about canned salmon. hop

- NOT LASAGNA?!
- SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! SNAP!
- I'm putting you on a diet, Garfield. You may have whatever you can sip through a straw.
- SUCK!
- Back to the drawing board. Do you know what constitutes a diet food?
- It's not the calories, it's not the protein, it's not the fiber...
- It's the bland. How goes the diet, Garfield?
- Have you lost anything yet? Yes.
- My sense of humor. Remember, Garfield, one drumstick a day on your diet and that's it.
-
- What the... I found a butcher who carries pterodactyl. You'll have to admit, Garfield...
- Noe that you're on a diet, you're feeling better about yourself. You bet.
- Aside from the hunger, dizziness and weakness, I'm having a ball. You're the correct weight...
- For an aircraft carrier, ha-ha.
- I shouldn't have said that.
- SLOSH!
-
-
-
-
-
- GABING! What do you get if you cross a cat and a dog?
-
- You get a stupid cat. Go fetch, Odie!

- When he comes to, he's going to be plenty mad. Ahem.
- Mee mee mee mee, arf arf arf arf arf, bark bark bark
- BARK! Garfield, I wish you wouldn't keep burying Odie in the sand.
- Big deal.
- I only buried him up to his knees. Don't like your cat food, huh?
- Is there anything I can give it?
- Last rites come to mind. You've finally done it, Garfield.
- You've tangled with something bigger than you.
- Yeh, but you should see the other truck. Hello, sunrise.
- Hello, flower garden.
-
-
- WACHOO
- Hello, hay fever. sniff Hey, Garfield. We're going to visit dad and mom on the farm this week.
- Where are you going?
- To pack my bibs, and stuff some hayseeds between my teeth. Say, mom, whatever happened to Nadine, my pet chicken? She's fine.
- This is great? What is it?
- Nadine noodle soup. She was family! This is where milk comes from, Garfield.
- How interesting, how informative.
- I'll never, EVER drink milk again as long as I live. ptooy
- Dad, you didn't.
- A good chew never hurt nobody. ssst ssst
- You're really getting into this farm thing, aren't you, Garfield? Yup.
- Wanna swap sheep jokes? oin! oink! oink!
-
- For being edible, you're sure pulling your luck, fella!
- Did you ever own a cat, Lyman?
- I grew up with four of 'em.
- What were their names?
- Let's see...
- There was ""cat"", ""cat"", ""cat"" and ""cat"". No names?
- What's the use of naming a pet that won't come if you call it? Good point. BRINNNNNG! SMACK!
- BOING!
- I hate mondays.
-
- It's not the valleys in life i dread so much as the dips.
- Garfield, there's nothing you can do or say to make me share my lasagna with you.
- Now that was an effective little ploy. FLIP
- FLIP!

- But, unfortunately for him...
- He was immediately nabbed by the world's first dogcatcher. GARFIELD'S HISTORY OF DOGS Tail wagging was invented by a dog named ""Bonzo Wag"".
- He found that tail wagging endeared him to humans.
- Bonzo also invented slobbering, but that didn't go over so well. GARFIELD'S HISTORY OF DOGS During the stone age, dogs were used for hunting much as they are today. bark bark

- 60% of the people in our nation are involved in some way with the food industry.
- That's right. Eating is not only fun, it's patriotic! This year, let's celebrate National Fat Week by stamping out fat jokes.
- Let's face it, fatties...
- We should be able to stamp out anything we wish. We fat people are constantly being discriminated against.
- Airplane and theater seats are too small. Designer clothing is not made in our size. But that's trivial.
- What this world really needs is a king-size sandbox. Here's a National Fat Week diet joke:
- What would you get if you cross a dieter with a nine-foot gorilla?
- You get a gorilla who diets anywhere he pleases. * OH, GARFIELD *

- Let's see...hairdressers, hearing aids, hit men.
- SPLOT!
- Let me guess. You're trying to tell me you don't like your meal. In my own subtle way. We cats are very unique.

- Hey, kid. How'd you like to play on this waffle iron? Bug off.
- I guess I'll have to use more subtle means. Hey, I was once a kitten too.

- Garfield, what would you say if I said my chair is damaged? I'd say you're right.
- What would you say if I said the damage looks like it was done by a cat? I'd say there do appear to be some abrasions of the claw persuasion.
- What would you say if I said we both know this cat? I'd say you're getting warm.
- What would you say if I said YOU are the cat who scratched mu chair? I'd say that is a distinct possibility.

- How long will he be in that body cast, doc? About a week. I could've guessed as much. I know it's no fun being in a cast, Garfield.
- We'll just have to make the best of your situation.
- You'll make a keen doorstop. You're really enjoying this, aren't you, Jon?

-
- scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch What should I do with your body cast, Garfield?
- I'd like to keep it.
- WHANG! Hmmm, it feels sleepy out there today.
- You're looking a little listless, Garfield. I prefer to think of this as an advanced state of relaxation.
- I'm taking you to the vet. Thea have a cure for lazy?
- His get up and go got up and went, doc. It's nothing a little catnap couldn't fix.
- A vitamin shot should do the trick.
- But you didn't even give him the shot. It's the thought that counts. tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity

- GARFIELD!
-
- Would you mind explaining yourself, Garfield?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Odie. Would you like some melon too?
- squeak squeak squeak
-
-
-
-
-
- WHOCK! SPLAT!
-
- GRANDPA!
- Stow it, sonny. Where's the refrigerator? It's great to see you, grandpa. Why, I'll bet you're still the best ratter in Middletown.
- I gave that up.
- Why? Ever try to gum a rat? How well I remember the day you were born, sonny. Yessire, you were 5 pounds 6 ounces at birth. That's big for a kitten.
- I was out of town at the time.
- Then how do you remember it? I heard the scream. Tell me about my youth, grandpa.
- You were born in the kitchen of Mamma Leoni's Italian restaurant. You frolicked in the fettucine, rolled in the ravioli and ate all the lasagna in sight.
- I must have broken some eating records. Not to mention a few health codes. I'm tired. I think I'll turn in. Aw, come on, grandpa. The night's still young. Let's talk.
- Let me tell you about the flood of '42.
- Works every time. Z What the...
- Why, I'll bet you two are related, aren't you? I can see the family resemblance.
- Take that back, you walleyed muck sucker. Z
- HEY, GARFIELD, LET'S GO JOGGING.
- SHOOP!
-
-
- AHA!
- EEEYOUCH!
- This is one of those times when I should have considered the consequences of my actions. Grandpa? What was I like when I was little?
-
- Okay...what was I like when I was YOUNG? Let me tell you... Tell me, grandpa, how's grandma? Looking more like a haddock every day.
- She could give mean lessons to Attila the Hun.
- You're not getting along, huh? You might say the honeymoon's over. Why aren't you and grandma getting along?
- I married her because she had a figure that wouldn't quit.
- So? It did. Did I ever tell you about the great famine of '59? It was sad.
- Food was so scarce, many people ate their cats.
- That's disgusting! And you're gullible. You kids have it good these days.
- I remember when I had to walk six miles every day just to chase rats.
- I don't buy that. Would you believe across the street to spook a chicken? Goodbye, grandpa. Keep in touch. I'll write soon.
-
- CATS CAN'T WRITE! Now you're getting the picture.
-
-
-
-
- ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Hello? Funny Farm? Do you take pets? Do you know what I like about cats, Garfield? You're so docile.
- ROWR!
- I hate to be pegged.
- Oh no!
- FOOD!
- Close, but no banana. I'll be stuck here for the rest of my living days if I don't do something.
- I guess I'll have to let go and drop to the floor.
-
-
- This table is dusty.
- ACHOO!
- Twenty years from now I'll look back on this and laaaaugh.
- There's one cute chicky-boo!
- She could sharpen her claws on my hassock any time.
- I wonder if she'd like to go back to the big caterwauling on Elm Street tonight.
- Well, hello there, Garfield.
- Oh, hi, Frank. Boy, am I bored.
- Good morning, Garfield. It's another day just like any other day. Isn't it great?
- Some people confuse boredom with security. I need a change.
- Maybe I'll take up a hobby. Maybe I'll learn a new language. Maybe I'll participate in a sport.
- Maybe I'll stay bored. It takes less effort. flick
- flick
- You know you're bored when flicking a lint ball becomes all-consuming. Every day it's the same boring food, same boring people, same boring routine... rrrr
- ROWR! FFFT!
- ...same boring fights. Do you know where I'm residing? Bored City, that's where.
- But not for long. With a positive mental attitude I can whip it.
- I think I'll make a lateral move to self-pity. I'm bored.
- ARRRGH
- That helped.
-
- CHOMP! GULP GOBBLE
- PLICK!
-
- ODIE!
-
- Somehow, I prefer Garfield in his less affectionate moods. Garfield, I've been thinking...
- I'm seriously considering having you declawed.
- Whatever for? Why would Jon want to have me declawed? A cat without claws is like a bee without a stinger...
- A porcupine without quills, a shark without teeth, a snake without fangs!
- I think I see his point. Granted, declawing a cat may spare the furniture. But it also renders a cat defenseless.
- Put yourself in my shoes...how would you like to go through life...
- Knowing somewhere out there is a dog with your name on it. Some friends of mine and I would like to discuss this declawing idea of yours.
-
- Thanks, friends. Garfield, I'm sorry I tried to have you declawed. Let's forgive and forget, okay?
- BUZZ
- I'll settle for ""forgive"". OH BOY! CHICKEN! I LOVE CHICKEN!
- Hold it, Garfield.
- I don't know how to break this to you. I know it's going to break your heart...
- But, I'm never letting you have chicken again. You might choke on the bones.
-
-
- OH BOY! HAMBURGERS! I LOVE HAMBURGERS! What? No period of mourning? I think it's time you met a lady cat, Garfield.
- And if you're not sure what to do on a date just watch me in action sometime. I have.
- Make an inuendo, get slapped. Make a suggestion, get slapped. Make a move, get slapped. Jon says this after shave is supposed to attract women.
- gallop gallop gallop gallop
- Darn...wrong species. It's time I met a cat of the female persuasion.
-
- What took you so long? What do they call you?
- My name's Arlene.
- And what do they call that space between your front teeth? This relationship is off to a tenuous start.
- Wanna eat mice? Wanna beat up dogs?
- How barbaric. how nauseating. Tell me, Arlene, what good is that space between your teeth?
- ***
- When will I see you again? Next time I want to hail a taxi. Cats can be broken to the leash if you just hang in there.
-
-
- Garfield, would you happen to know what happened to the lasagna I fixed for dinner?
- *
- I didn't know you could whistle. I'd tap-dance too if it would change the subject. Did I ever tell you I'm 29, Garfield?
- You would have been 30 but you were sick a year. I would have been 30 but I was sick a year.
- MY KINGDOM FOR A NEW PUNCH LINE! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
- Why, Garfield Arbuckle...The spirit of Christmas is giving, not receiving.
- I'll give you this if you don't give me that. Now GIMME! That's the spirit. I love Christmas.
- The parties and the presents...
- The caroling, the presents. The food, the presents, the decorations, the presents, the fun and the presents. Merry Christmas! OH NO! I overslept!
- I'M LATE!
- For my nap. Oh no! They've raised my electricity bill again! What'll I doo? There's only one thing to do in a case like this...
- SLEEP ON IT!
- A real man of action. zzzz
- No sweat, sarge. I'll take that machine gun nest out with my trusty bazooka here.
- So this is what it feels like to be potato salad.
- Rhett, rhett. Whatever shall I do? Wherever shall I go?
- Take me to your leader, earthling, or I'll atomize your face.
- That food's for eating, Garfield. What are you trying to do? Make me sick or something? GARFIELD! I'M
-
- Home. Gotcha again. This year I resolve to be nicer to Odie.
- KONG!
- Now that that's out of the way, I can enjoy new year's eve. Here you are, Madelyn, my dear.
- There's a cat hair in my punch!
- GARFIELD! So this is 1981.
- A brand new year fresh with new promise.
- Big, fat, hairy deal. GOBBLE! GOBBLE! GOBBLE!
- WHERE'S YOUR DINNER?!! WHERE'S MY DINNER?!!
- Once my eating gains momentum it's hard to shut down. Okay, who ate my socks?
-
- GARFIELD!! The guy's some kind of a psychic! What's this strange feeling I feel today?
- I feel like being nice to everyone today!
- KISS
- KISS KISS KISS KISS . KISS
- People don't want nice...people want consistency. FEED ME! FEED ME! FEED ME! OKAY! OKAY!
-
- Z We cats nap anywhere, anytime.
- Everyone should be so lucky.
- With the possible exception of airline pilots. Z
- Z
- When Garfield naps, he naps HARD. Z Here it comes again! NAP ATTACK!
- zzzz Oh no! I feel a nap attack coming on. But the movie's almost over. I must stay awake!
-
- Z Boy, what a great night's sleep. YAWN
- HEY, GARFIELD. LET'S GO JOGGING.
- Z What happened to my favorite record? I scratched it.
- What happened to the lasagna I fixed for dinner?! I ate it.
- GARFIELD; WHY IS IT YOU SCRATCH, EAT AND DESTROY EVERYTHING IN SIGHT?! I CAN'T HELP IT! I'M A SLAVE TO MY PASSIONS!
- CATS! HUMANS!
- I'm sorry, Garfield. If you didn't do those things you wouldn't be a cat. I love you for what you are. That's okay.
- What happened to my fern? Don't ask. Stand aside, boy. There's lasagna to be eaten!
-
- We have an understanding, Garfield and I...I provide the food, shelter, and affection, and he provides the abuse. ROWRRRR
- elbow
- EROWR Prima donna. I've been watching television too long.
- I'd better take a break.
-
- You eat too fast, Garfield. says who?
- BURP
-
- A seeing eye dog. What's with you?
- Someone switched my eyedrops with the airplane glue. That's terrible!
- No wonder my model airplane wouldn't stick together.
- We're going for a nature walk, Garfield. Super.
- Just smell that fresh country air. Sniff...ACHOO!
- Hark. That's the call of a lesser bittern of the heron family. WAKA, WAKA Waka, smaka.
- Rolling meadows, lush forests, majestic mountains...
- Have you ever seen such splendor? Lovely. YAWN
- TRIP!
- It must be Monday. SLUP
- That was my hot water, Garfield. I was going to make tea. I know that.
- Weird. That's the biggest bird I've ever seen!
-
- Garfield, time to eat. I can see the headlines now.
- ""Cat gets hijacked"".
- ""And duck gets hernia"" Flying looks pretty simple.
-
- AARRRRGG Oh pooh.
- Oh goody.
- Oh pooh. City Pound City Pound SLAM!
- How did I get into this fix? One minute I'm free as a bird, then I'm in the city pound. Where did I go wrong?
- I'm just a number here. I've almost forgotten what it's like on the outside.
- IT'S NOT RIGHT TO CAGE A WILD ANIMAL!
- THESE FOUR WALLS ARE CLOSING IN ON ME! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!
- You've only been here two minutes. I know, but this is my first shot at a prison scene. I can't believe it. Me, Garfield, in a dog pound.
- That's ""City Pound."" There are cats here too, you know.
- Arf arf. Oh shut up, fluffy. My name's Guido, and this here is my associate, Fluffy.
- Guido and Fluffy?
- I've killed for less than that. One of your sensitive-tough types. Tell me, Guido. Why is Fluffy here in the city pound?
- His previous owner encountered considerable difficulty in cultivating Fluffy with the proper hygienic habits.
- Couldn't be housebroken, huh? Puddle City. How long will I have to stay here in the pound? Till your owner comes to pick you up.
- What if he doesn't come? Then it's curtains for you.
- Great! I love to sharpen my claws on curtains. How do I break this to him? We gotta bust out of this pound. Got any ideas? Why don't we use Fluffy as a battering ram?
- FLUFFY! BE A BATTERING RAM! Yah.
- CRASH! Thanks for helping me escape from the pound, Guido. No sweat.
- It's nice to finally be out of trouble. What a relief it is to be returning to the safety and comfort of home.
- Whatever that is...
-
- Why, hello there. I'm lost.
- Aren't you cute! Can you give me directions!
- Run along now, Kitty.
-
-
- What did I do? So what if I'm lost. Big deal. I can handle it.
- Cats are adventurous. Cats are independent. Cats are strong...
- I WANT MY TEDDY BEAR! It should be no problem finding my way home. Cats have a natural homing instinct.
- My instinct tells me to go that way.
- BONK! FOOD! I GOTTA HAVE FOOD!
- Health Food Store
- FOOD! I GOTTA HAVE FOOD! Boy, am I beat. I must've walked two blocks today.
- It will be nice to get home. I miss my chew bone, my chew toy,
- And Odie, my chew dog. I guess I'll have to hitchhike home.
- Fortunately for me, I have something most other cats don't.
- Thumbs. GARFIELD! WELCOME BACK!
- I'm starved. You must be starved. I'll get some food.
- Home is where they understand you. * *
- * * **
- ** ? **

- ***! MY FEET! WHERE ARE MY FEET?!
-
- Maybe I could stand to lose a pound or two. Garfield, you won't say you're fat...
- But you have more chins than a Hong Kong telephone directory!
- I wish Jon wouldn't kid me about my weight.
- I'm a very sensitive person.
- Et tu, chair? My, my, a chocolate covered peanut.
- RIP!
- I think I need a bigger cat suit.
-
- Sorry about that. GARFIELD! DINNER!
- I appreciate your promptness, Garfield...
- BUT, NEXT TIME, OPEN THE DOOR! Oops. Watch out, Metropolis. Garfield is in town.
- This is my night to howl.
- AROOO
- Hey, baby, what's happenin' Buzz off, creep.
- arooooo
- Hi there, how about a kiss? Don't do me no favors.
- How about you and me. Pack it in, jack.
- aroooo. Uh-oh. It's diet time.
- Let's diet together, Garfield. That would be more fun.
- How does the old proverb go? ""Misery loves company"". Welcome to the first day of your diet, Garfield.
- Through self-denial, you will realize a slimmer, more self-assured you.
- I THINK I'M GONNA DIE! I shall now attempt to eat a lunch consisting of one leaf of lettuce.
- Lightly seasoned with...
- One quart of mayonnaise! BLOP Dieting is easy when you set your mind to it.
- I no longer crave food.
- IT'S THE CALORIES I CRAVE!
-
- I gotta get off this diet! Zowie! A picture of lasagna!
- RIP!
- Not too bad except for the staples. ptooey SNAP!
- I love static electricity. scuff scuff scuff scuff
- POP!
- SCUFF SCUFF SCUFF SCUFF SCUFF
- POW
- I hate static electricity. BRINNNNG!
- I love to wake up early.
- The earlier you set your alarm, the longer you can oversleep. It's yawn and crick time.
- YAWN
- CRICK! Eat your food, Garfield. No, It's youkky.
- How would you like to go to bed without dinner?
- Somehow, that psychology doesn't seem to work on Garfield. Why do people love teddy bears?
- It's for their don'ts...
- They don't eat your food. They don't dance with your date and they don't trump your ace lead.
- I wonder what grandiose dream Garfield is having right now.
- Have you ever seen such a sad movie in all your life, Garfield?
- Maybe I'm too hardened. Maybe I'm too cynical...
- But I wasn't that moved by ""Flipper Gets The Ick"".
- I declare this chair the sole property of Garfield The Cat.
- Move it, Garfield. That's my chair. My chair.
- MY CHAIR! MY CHAIR!
- MY CHAIR! MY CHAIR!
- KICK! My chair. My cushion. GRRR ROWR
- EYOUCH!
- One should not bare one's claws while lying on them. Claws.
- THOCK!
- The only way to eat olives. What's this welling up within my soul?
- By golly, it's my primal urges.
- Civilization as we know it may come to an end now that the CLAW is here! The Claw spots groceries.
- ZIP!
- What a lousy epitaph...""he shuffled off this mortal oil at the hand of canned goods"".The Claw spots boy with balloon.
- POW!
- The claw enjoys a cruel laugh at a young child's expense. WAH! The Claw sets out to wreak havoc.
- CRASH BAM SMASH WHAM
- The claw gets his havoc wreaked by the fang.
- Poor me.
- All alone in the rain...nobody notices, nobody cares.
- I think I'll catch pneumonia and die. That'll make'm feel bad.
- GARFIELD! GET IN HERE!
- Everyone needs a good bout with self-pity now and then. I'm putting you into training, Garfield.
- CATCH THE MOUSE! KILL THE MOUSE! CHASE IT!
- I'm disappointed in you. You're just another dumb animal. If I wait for the forward thrust to diminish, I should be able to retrieve it at my leisure. Garfield, where's your windup mousie?
- You didn't...? No of course you didn't.
- ptooey GET THAT MOUSE, GARFIELD! What mouse? Squeak
- I KNOW IT'S THERE. I HEAR IT SQUEAK, NOW DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Squeak
- koink koink koink CATCH THAT MOUSE, GARFIELD!
- Now what do I do with it? Eat it!
- Who knows where that mouse has been? Why do people expect us cats to eat mice?
- This mouse could be somebody's mother. This mouse could be a deacon in its little mouse church.
- And some of the fuzzy sucker's bones might get caught in my throat. KILL THE MOUSE, GARFIELD!
- NO! I RESPECT MY WARMBLOODED BROTHERS AND SISTERS MORE THAN THAT!
- I'll reserve my abuse for the lower life forms.
- Cats can stare anything down.
-
- I win.
-
- I win again.
- Uh oh.
- This one's going to be tough. Oh Marcia. Oh Bob.
- kissy kissy smooch
- It's time Jon had another date. kiss It's time to go to the veterinary clinic, Garfield.
- Sometimes I think Jon uses me as an excuse to see that lady vet. SLAM
- Especially when he forgets to take me along. Hellooo, doc. Remember me? Where's your cat?
- Forget my cat. Can't we get started without him? Sure.
- First a vitamin E shot to give your coat a keener sheen. I'll get my cat. How a bout a date, my little kitten?
- I don't date men who who use animal names out of context.
- Rats. Why don't you like me?
- You're wishy-washy, crude, and a twerp.
- I mean aside from that. Your cat is extremely overweight, Mr. Arbuckle. It could lead to serious heart problems. Not to worry.
- I don't think Garfield has a heart.
- See?!
- I'm going to jog this morning.
- Of course, it will be cold when I start.
- But then I'll get hot and sweaty.
- And my heart will pound, making me dizzy.
- I'll get blisters on my feet.
- Then I'll be stiff and sore for days.
- Jogging probably wouldn't be so bad. But the anticipation is killing me. I wonder what today is?
- BONK!
- Monday. There are two of us and only one donut, Garfield. Let's share it.
-
- Where's my share? Look closely. I left the hole for you. bark! bark! bark!
-
- I fail to see the sport in it. Ah, a screen door upon which to hang.
-
- They don't make'm like they used to. Hello. What's this?
- Don't panic, Garfield. It's only a little rain.
- AAAAAAAAAAAAA I love lasagna fresh from the oven: the tomato sauce, the meat, the melted cheese.
-
- GARFIELD! I', going out, Garfield. The women will be hysterical over me. The outfit's hysterical.
- What do you think about my attire? It could use some alteration.
- Let's tuck that tie in and add some vents to the sleeves.
-
- A smart cat knows just how far to go without crossing over the line.
- Perhaps a more rakish tilt to the hat.
- Just remember, Garfield, when we get to the farm you are there to relax.
- I know last time you wanted to be helpful...
- But you do not grow chickens by planting chickens in the ground! It was an hones mistake. Mothers equate love with food. When they feed you they're saying, ""I love you"".
- Eat, eat, eat.
- And I love you, too. The light bulb's burned out.
- Don't worry about me, I'll just sit here in the dark going blind.
- I'll fix it. He's such a good boy. When I was your age I was married and had a kid. Yeh, me!
-
- Good argument, son. But I still think you should get married. Now that the sun has set, we come to the exciting part.
- We turn around to watch the moon rise.
- Be still my beating heart. It IS kind of pretty out here on the farm.
- chirp chirp
- Walt Disney, eat your heart out.
- Uh oh. I'll never make it across that sunbeam awake.
- Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
- Z poomp!
- Come on , Garfield, let's go for a walk. Z
- Z Z You're getting a little pudgy there, Garfield.
- Maybe you'd be more attractive to the ladies if you'd suck your gut in.
- And then again, maybe not. Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me.
- Buenos dias, mon sweet. I knew you'd come back to me.
- Of course you did, fatso. You're sitting on my rubber mouse. Tell me, Arlene, how does it feel to have a huge, ugly, disgusting gap between your front teeth?
- BAP!
- Oh. ROWR OOOO
- Why do cats always caterwaul when they date? Would you rather come to my place and see my cat show trophy?
- EROOO How about us having a lasting relationship, Garfield?
- I'm sorry, Arlene. I'm already hopelessly in love with somebody else.
- Who? Me. Thanks for the date, Arlene. How about a good night kiss?
- kiss kiss smack kiss
- Masher.
- Aren't pet stores fascinating, Garfield?
- The cute hamsters, the canaries, the tropical fish.
- Garfield?
- GARFIELD?!!
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, let's go home for lunch. No thanks, I just ate. Where were you last night, Garfield?
-
- You met a ballet dancer and went to a sack race? Close enough. Z
- BARK!
- yip! yip! YIP! YIP!
-
- If there is such a thing as reincarnation, I'd like to come back as a movie star.
- What would you like to come back as, Garfield? What a silly question.
- A dogcatcher, of course. Mornin', Jon. What'll you have? Ham'n'eggs, eggs over easy.
- And what'll you have, sir?
- One of each will do nicely, thank you. Garfield. Cats can't walk on their hind feet.
- I didn't know that.
- dial dial
- Hello, Ingrid? How about a date this weekend?
- Okay...then how about next weekend? How about the weekend after that?
- Maybe the weekend after that? Or the weekend after that? The next one? How about the weekend after that?
- Look Ingrid, if you don't want to go out with me, why don't you just say so!
- SLAM!
- I guess I told her. String 'em along then break their hearts. Right, Jon? The moon is right.
- The time is right.
- Good evening, ladies and germs. A funny thing happened on the way here tonight... A canary walks up to me the other day and he says, ""I haven't had a bite in three days."" So you know what I did?
- I ate him!
- Yah dah dah dah dah dah tappity tappity tappity O solo MEYOW
-
- I know you're out there. I can hear you breathing. My next song is for all you lovely ladies out there.
- Heck with it. This is for you ugly ones, too.
- BAP! BOP! BAP! AROOOO
- THOCK! Ha ha! I was prepared this time.
- KACHUNG! Take my dog...please.
- What's that?
- HOOK! BRING!
- Good morning, Garfield. Here's your yummy breakfast.
- SPLAT! Yuk.
- scratch RIP! scratch
- Chirp chirp
- EEEEEK!
- Just another day in the life of a typical cat. Why were cats placed upon this earth?
- Why, to give people pleasure.
- And to give dogs a hard way to go. SMACK! There's nothing like a steaming cup of coffee and a newspaper to get the day started.
-
- I'd enjoy it even more if I could read. ROWR
-
- Once again I venture into the wilderness in search of quarry.
- I spot my prey, but I must make a clean kill.
- Hamburgers can be vicious if they're only wounded. I eat too much, I sleep too much and I don't exercise at all.
- There's certainly room for improvement.
- I think I'll take up smoking.
- gobble gobble gobble gobble
- It's been a big day.
- MROW OOOO
- ROWRR UR
- AROOOOOOO
- Thanks for the date, Garfield. Take care, Arlene.
- YAWN
- POOMP!
- I'll get you for this, Monday.
- Ha ha. How can I resist you when you're cute? Help yourself, Garfield.
- A fool and his lasagna are soon parted.
-
- How do you feel about jogging this morning, Garfield?
- How do you feel about bleeding this morning.
- I get your drift. Bright lad. If you want to eat, use this can opener, Garfield.
- You know what to do with it. Yes, I do.
- Gimme a steak.
- Okay, who put eyeballs on my hamburger?
-
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, GARFIELD?!
- You were walking down the street minding your own business...
- SNIFF You stopped to smell a flower...
- When a big dog slipped up behind you...
- CLOBBER
- And beat the stuffing out of you. You are so right. Hey, Garfield, what do you think of my new wallpaper?
-
- I like it. If I were the cruel sort, I'd shove Odie off the table.
- But I'm not.
- Teddy bears, on the other hand... BOMP! GET OUT OF MY CHAIR. OUT! OUT!
- Pooky wants to watch television . I guess I know where I fall in the order of things. I have a new diet for you, Garfield. You can eat all you want.
- After eating five pounds of carrots!
- Garfield, you hang around the house too much.
- What can I do to interest you in the great outdoors?
- You can screen it in and out a roof over it, for starters.
- NAP ATTACK!
- I hate him. Z I wonder if I could stand on just two feet?
- Hey, this is great! I'm standing!
- Now I can tap-dance. tap tap tap tappity tap tap
- And I can reach the tabletop.
- And drop-kick Odie. DROP KICK!
- Garfield! Cats can't walk on their HIND FEET!
- SMACK! See? Thanks a lot. Would you like to go camping, Garfield?
- WHAT?! AND GET WET WHEN IT RAINS, FREEZE AT NIGHT AND GET THORNS IN MY PAWS?!
- We'll have pan-baked lasagna. I'm packed. Let's go. Everything's packed for the camping trip, Garfield. Did I forget anything?
-
- Anything else? Yes, 250 miles of extension cord.
- There's only one thing I like about cars.
- The upholstered ceilings.
- Garfield! Get out of there!
- The light DOES turn off when the glove compartment is closed. boing boing
- Are you bored, Garfield?
- We'll find out how bored I am if I don't get to a litter box soon. Get out of the car, Garfield.
- Let us bask in the sun and sleep with nature's creatures, Garfield.
- Translation: ""Let's bake our brains and lie on the ground with bugs and snakes, Garfield"". Well, here we are in the wilds, Garfield. Keep a sharp eye out for wild animals.
- WHAT?!
- WHA...?!
- You're just fooling me, aren't you?
-
- Oh, no, you don't, Garfield.
- I'll wise up to your tricks if it's the last thing I do. Come on across the creek, Garfield.
- I don't know why you cats are so afraid of a little mud.
- You would be too if you had to wash yourself with your tongue. Welcome to our first night of camping, Garfield. enjoy.
- ROAR!
- You enjoy. I'll be waiting in the car. Lock your door, Garfield. This is a tough neighborhood.
- I know.
- How often do you see kids having a fire hydrant eating contest?
-
-
-
- Tell me that's not a traffic cop's hat you're wearing, Garfield. Okay, it's not a traffic cop's hat. I'm bored. I think I'll step out for some fresh air.
- GARFIELD! WE ARE GOING OVER 50!
- So I noticed.
- Well, well, Here comes Arlene.
- Hey, baby, what's happenin'? Buzz off, creep.
- How about a gourmet dinner? I'm all yours!
-
- You really shouldn't have. Hang the expense. Only the best garbage for you, my dear. You again. Me again.
- Nermal, the world's cutest kitten.
- Now, stand aside, fatso. I have people to charm. Out!
- You can scratch my chair, you can insult my mother, you can beat up my dog, and you can play with my rubber mousie...
- But you don't eat my food and you don't sleep into my bed. Yes, sir. We cats are very independent.
- We don't need attention.
- Unless it's being given to someone else. Come here, Nermal.
- Make yourself useful.
- Where are you going? Trolling for dogs.
- MINE!
- Pooky is a one-cat teddy bear. I guess I'll be leaving. Must you rush?
- If you insist, I'll stay.
-
- pat pat pat
-
-
-
-
-
- PUNT! Fetch, boy.
-
- Obedient...not very bright, but obedient.
-
- Oh, Garfield. BAP!
- woinng
- woinng
- BARK!
- Pets. BOP!
- WHANGO
- Nobody beats up on Odie but me. Do you know what I hate about dogs?
- Dogs are so ... so ... so
- friendly.
- PUNT!
-
-
- boing! boing! boing! boing!
- CRASH!
- I love you when you're naughty. It's Monday. Nothing good ever happens to me on mondays.
- So I'm going to stay in the middle of this big field all day, where I can't get hurt.
- SPOING! Claire, baby! What say you and I go out tonight and paint the town red, sweets?
- Yeh, maybe another time?
- Now who should I call? Try Clods Anonymous. Hellooo, Mary. Say, good lookin', where have you been all my life?
- I see...you lived on Main Street until you were two, then you moved to Rosewood where you presently reside.
- Shall I ask her out, Garfield? Sounds like a match made in heaven. Hanging on the screen door was more dangerous in olden times when people threw their dishwater out.
- GOOSH
- Old habits die hard. I can hear them sneaking up behind me now.
- They are crouching, getting ready to leap.
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GARFIELD! What a wonderful surprise!
-
- GARFIELD! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SPEAK TO ME! I'm not speaking to you.
- I'm bored.
- Bored, bored bored.
- There must be more things to do on a screen door than just hang there.
-
-
-
- Nice going, dummy. There you are, Garfield. A genuine Naugahyde leash.
- How inhumane! How cruel!
- Do you know how many naugas they killed to make this leash?
- ROWRR!!
- hop hop Where are you going, Jon? I'm breaking Garfield to the leash.
- He doesn't like it much, does he? How can you tell?
-
- You wait here while I go into the store.
- Leashes are the greatest things since sliced bread.
- By the way, don't forget the frozen lasagna. You know, Garfield, I've come to realize leashes aren't right for cats.
- Now there's a news flash for you.
- Next he will come to realize icebergs weren't right for the Titanic. Sit up.
- Roll over, Odie.
- Speak. Urf.
- Play dead.
- Beg.
- WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE?! I hate rain.
- I'm so depressed.
- Happiness is only a fair weather friend.
- WAHCHOO!
- Floral print.
- WAHCHOO!
- SNIFF Dear Garfield, How do I avoid the embarrassment of cat hair all over my house when I have company? Harried.
- Simple.
- Never invite anyone to your home again. I love sunny windowsills.
-
- And I hate open windows.
-
- Stay away from rocking chairs. Sound advice.
-
-
- Oh yuk!
- What did you drag that fish in for?
- SMACK! BONK!
- When a cat presents you with a dead, smelly thing, it's an expression of love, you twit. Here's a lesson in the natural order of things.
- Cats use claws to climb up trees.
- And fire departments to get down. What does Garfield the cat do when he's stuck up a tree?
- Why what any honorable cat would do, of course.
- WAHHH! I'm getting out of this tree.
- BOING!
- I didn't allow for my resilient nature. Poor me..stuck up a tree.
- Things could be worse, I guess.
- Why do I always get stuck up trees?
- It must be the cat in me.
- Right on. Come here, cat. ROWR!
- ROWR FFT! Here you are, cat. kiss Thanks. Oh good, it's here.
- This rubber burger should be good for some laughs.
- CHOMP!
- SPROING!
- ROWR! Hee hee.
- GRRRR HA! HA! HA!
-
- It was worth it.
-
- You could've asked me to pass the salt. Cats don't ask. Cats take. Just look at yourself, Garfield. You're becoming a soft, sugar dependent, grease-eating lard ball. Is that what you want?
- YES!
- Let me rephrase that... Some people say I'm fat.
- Big deal, I love to eat.
- Waddling and sweating is kind of fun too.
- BASH!
- Good morning, fatso. All I did was jump off the bed. It isn't healthy for a cat to be as big as you are, Garfield.
- Why, you could get heart disease, get fallen arches...
- Get harpooned. Couldn't resist it could you.
- CRASH
- Maybe I should go on diet. Let me give you a driving session, Garfield.
- When you're as good a driver as I am, you drive defensively.
- You look both ways at an intersection.
- Then you proceed with caution.
- HONK! SCREEEE!
- Darn you, Garfield. I'm such a kidder. I think you're eating too much salt, Garfield. I'm going to take it out of your diet.
- If you must.
- But I'm sure going to miss my salt lick. I'm putting you on a diet, Garfield. OH NO!
- I may have to resort to desperate emergency measures.
- Like chasing mice. I'm going to start you on your diet slowly, Garfield.
- For the rest of the week you may have no desserts. Fine and dandy.
- Helloooo, main course. Hello, ice cream. Hello, hamburger. Hello, lasagna.
- Get away from the refrigerator, Garfield. You're on a diet.
- What were you doing? Just visiting some old friends. I'm on a diet again. What a bummer.
- Soon there will be less of me around.
- I'm going to miss me.
-
- The lost-your-will-to-live phase of the diet, huh? Let me die in peace.
-
-
-
-
-
- Going to do some singing on the ol' fence tonight? Music is my life. Hello. What's this?
-
- I hate mondays. Garfield, Garfield, Garfield. You ate my fern. I'm a bad boy.
- Now I'll have to go buy another one.
- I hope it tastes better than this one.
-
- MMMPH Good morning, Garfield.
- Don't speak to me just yet.
- Some people have no respect for slow risers.
-
- In the flower garden again, Garfield? How'd you guess? Do you know what this country needs? More dog pounds.
- Anti-dog mines around fire hydrants! Dog hunting season! Dog traps!
- Relax, Garfield. You're going to burst something. Why, millions could be saved on carpet cleaning bills alone. *
- Garfield, lasagna!
-
-
- I waxed the table today. When my bones knit, you are a dead man.
-
- You know it's Monday when you find sharks circling in your water bowl. I'm in the mood for a good fight, but I am personally opposed to senseless violence.
- PUNT!
- That's for not being a cat. Hey look, Garfield. This is my impression of a bowling ball.
- SHOOP!
- That was my impression of a vacuum cleaner. I feel like getting into a big fight today.
-
- Now I feel like holing up somewhere to whimper for a while. What do you want to do tonight, Garfield? Do you want to go jogging? Go to a movie? Play miniature golf.
- Or would you rather go eat?
- Natch. Do you take your cat everywhere?
- Yes, we do everything together, my dear.
- Except make passes at ugly waitresses. Here it comes, folks.
- Tah-dah!
-
- Lasagna anyone? I'll pass. Nope. I'm on a diet. I think I'll wait for dessert. I just ate. I wonder where I should go on vacation.
- Maybe France or Spain...
- Or Mexico. Garfield, I've decided to take a vacation. Great! When do we leave?
- I don't think you understand. I said ""I"", not ""we"".
- Say you're just kidding. I think you understand. I can't believe Jon's not taking me on vacation.
- Cats need vacations too.
- All this eating and sleeping can wear a guy down. Aunt Gussie, would you take care of my cat while I'm gone on vacation? ...terrific!
- You know aunt Gussie, Garfield. She's a sweet old lady.
- How can you say that about someone who used to double date with Lizzie Borden? Garfield, meet aunt Gussie.
- I'm tickled pink to meet you.
- And you can color me unimpressed. While I'm gone take good care of Garfield.
- And keep a close eye on him. He gets a lot of mischief.
- Have fun, Garfield. Garfield?
- pat pat pat
-
- POOMP!
- I would have had to eat him to save face. Stowing away in Jon's suitcase is thirsty work.
- GLUCK GLUCK GLUCK
- Even after shave lotion tastes good if you're dry enough. Look out, sunny beaches.
- Here comes Don Juan.
- And his sidekick, Lawrence of Boxer Shorts. I can't believe you stowed away in my suitcase, Garfield.
- I'll bet you don't even know where we are.
- A tourist trap would be a safe assumption. That's the trouble with vacation spots.
- This hamburger is terrible!
- What do you expect for a lousy $23,50? This is the life, Garfield.
- You know you're on vacation when you see women in bikinis, hibiscus blossoms in the pool...
- And la cucarachas in the sock drawer. Pardon me...I believe I dropped my nobel peace prize around here somewhere. Beat it, crap.
-
- Hey, Garfield, guess what?
- The dog next door is being given a birthday party today.
- This brick should make a spiffy gift.
-
- BONK! YIP!
- YIP! Happy birthday, dog.
-
- Hello, doctor? Do you think you could surgically remove my cat from a dog? Hey, Garfield. It says here they are holding auditions for a cat food commercial.
- Would you be interested?
- Have my agent give the script a look-see. To win the cat food commercial audition you'll have to be a convincing eater.
- Can you handle that? Are you kidding?
- When it comes to eating, I'm a genius. Imagine me doing a cat food commercial.
- Next there'll be the movie offers, the screaming fans, the limousines...
- Belly, you and I are going places. Is this where my cat auditions for the cat food commercial? Yeh.
- Hey, Larry. Break out the wide-angle lens.
- If I don't get the part, the director is going to be sporting those shades up his right nostril. Okay, food commercial audition take one, action! That stuff looks awful.
- CUT!
- You're supposed to eat it, cat. What's my motivation` Okay, cat food commercial audition take two, action!
- Yuk!
- Mmph grp bruf What's the director saying, Garfield? Loosely translated, I don't fit the part.
- Good morning, Garfield.
-
-
- SLUP
- * Good morning * Well, if it isn't Nermal, the Shirley Temple of the feline set.
- How's it going, Nermal? Oh, about the same. I'm overadored as usual.
- Do you know why I hate Nermal?
- It's not because he's so young , tiny and cute...
- He reminds me I'm so old, fat and ugly.
- I can't reach that pie, Nermal. What say we team up?
- Maybe I could be as popular as Nermal if I learned to dance.
-
- I think I hurt something. MINE!
-
- Yours. Sorry you have to leave so soon, Nermal. But, I wasn't...
-
- I'm not afraid of him wearing out his welcome. I don't want him to break in a new one. I'll have a steak, fries and a large Cola.
- And my cat here will have an order or lasagna.
- WHAP!
- Make that a double order.
- BONK!
- Perhaps a triple order.
- GOOSH!
- Heck with it. Give him the whole pan. And give it wings.
- SWIPE!
- I hate mondays. Hee hee
- HA HA HA!
- When you're built low to the ground, a walk in the grass can be ticklish. Hello, tree. Hello, flowers.
- Hello, apteryx.
- There you have it, folks.
- Medical science has a cure for almost everything but the common cold...
- And the early morning stares. Surprise, Garfield! I got you a scratching post. Gee, thanks.
-
- scratch scratch scratch YAWN
- ARRRGH!
- Why are you wearing my reading glasses? All the better to scane you with, my dear.
-
- rats!
- I went and did it again.
- Here I am, doomed to die again. If I stay up here I'll starve. If I jump I'll become a cat pancake. I hope someone rescues me.
- Stuck up th tree again, Garfield? Help! Help! Rats, I'd like to sleep in this morning, but I'm hungry too.
- *
- Z Go fetch the paper, Odie.
-
- Ha ha ha! What a great plot, fine acting, super photography.
- I love commercials.
-
- You're no longer a kitten, Garfield. If cats can run up trees, why can't cats run DOWN trees as well?
-
- Garfield, you are very, very stupid. Owning a pet is ideal for single people. We have companionship without the hassle of raising a family.
-
- Wipe your feet before coming into the house! Okay, dad.
- Shoo, mice. Get out of my vitamin pills.
- Mice get into everything.
- Somebody could chase them out of here.
- I wonder why they wanted the vitamins?
- It beats me. Guess what, Garfield? We are going back to the farm.
- It will be nice to get back in touch with mother nature.
- When you find her, give her my best. It will be nice seeing mon and dad on the farm.
- Maybe we can help with the chores, Garfield. No way.
- I'd get dizzy rotating the crops. I'm bored...bored, bored bored. Things could be worse I guess.
- SPLOOT
- Bingo. It's just my luck to fall into a hog waller.
- Nothing is less appealing than a muddy cat.
- Hello there, good lookin'. Oh shut up. How can you hogs stand to lie in a waller all day?
- The mud keeps the flies off and keeps us cool.
- And if we ever get out, the mud dries instantly. It's time to go home, Garfield. Let me knock that mud off you.
- CRACK!
- Thanks...I think. ROWR!
- Aw, wadda matter? Did Puppy tat hurt his paw? Let me give it a kiss.
- KISS
- There we go. All better.
-
- Pooey! Where's the disinfectant? I'm bored...bored, bored, bored. I hat Monday. I hate routine.
-
- RUMBA RUMBA SNORT RIP It's going to be one of those weeks. Where is it written I have to act like a cat?!
- Why can't I act like a moose instead?
- Stop being silly, Garfield.
- Careful, fella. I've gored people for less than that. Hello, I'm a bluebird.
- Garfield, you're too big to be acting this way. But I'm small for a sperm whale.
- I'm thinking of getting you some professional psychiatric help. You mean there are AMATEUR psychiatrists? Doctor, I'm afraid my cat is having a nervous breakdown.
- Z
- Breakdown, maybe...nervous, no. I've psychoanalyzed your cat, Mr. Arbuckle...
- He's just fine. Great!
- It's good to know you're normal, Garfield. My friends call me moon unit. I'm glad you passed your psychological examination, Garfield. Isn't it great to know you're normal like everyone else?
-
- FWEEE dial dial dial
- Hello, Joe's Garage? Can you look at my car?
- I'd like to bring him in for a checkup. But I just had one.
- You'd better flush out his system...
- Tighten his hoses.
- Replace all the worn parts.
- Oh yes, and have him reupholstered.
- Garfield? Abu Dhabi I hate Monday...it marks the beginning of a long week of drudgery with no end in sight.
- And I don't even have a job.
- I'm just a social chameleon. Here comes Arlene. One look from those dewy eyes turns me into jelly. I'd go to the ends of the earth for her.
-
- Touch my teddy bear and you'll be picking those false eyelashes off the ceiling, lady.
- RRRRR
- I thought you asked me to dinner. Old habits are hard to break. I love those pointy little ears of yours and those luscious ruby red lips.
- And I love listening to the melodic strains of the wind whistling through the gap between your front teeth.
- You went one to far, fella. You're cute when you're angry. You know, Arlene, you are the second most beautiful cat I've ever met.
- Who is she?
- ""Who is she?"" she asks. Let's go mousing. You go ahead.
- How about a good night kiss? Forget it.
- Lips that touch mice will never touch mine.
- Here, catch, Garfield.
-
- Good boy!
- I think I hear the paperboy.
- Now I'm going to catch the morning paper.
-
- Stupid weekend edition.
- Okay, Mr. Cat. You caught me. Go ahead and eat me. Don't worry about the fact I have seven kids at home.
- I'm not going to eat you. Go home. To seven screaming kids? What kind of monster are you? I hear mice spread filth and disease.
- Do you believe everything you hear? Yes.
- I hear swinging a dead cat over your head by the full moon at midnight brings good luck. Touche. Tell me, mouse, what do you do for a living?
- I pose for anti-vermin posters. A cute mouse like you?
- That's very good. Look, cat, you need a reason to be kept here and I need food. I'll show up infront of your owner and you chase me off. You'll have a job and I'll have a place to live.
- Won't Jon get suspicious when I keep chasing the same mouse?
- I'll wear different wigs. You thought of everything. GARFIELD! A MOUSE! urp
-
- You're making me look bad, mouse. I'm too full to run. Why don't we run out there and eat all the food? My owner won't let us.
- Then let's kill him.
- It is not wise to rub out the hand that feeds you. Can I nibble the toes out of his sweat socks?
- You know, some foods are funnier than others.
- Beets are funny.
- Liver...not funny.
- Prunes are funny, potatoes aren't.
- Chicken, now, that's funny.
- How about pickles and kumquats for lunch, Garfield?
- WAH HA HA!
- FOOM!
- You know it's Monday when you discover a land mine in your breakfast. Cats have extraordinary powers of perception. I sense an evil presence in this room.
-
- Make that a STUPID presence. pick pick
- pick pick
- Well, well, What have we here? Call it a nervous habit. pick scratch scratch scratch
- scratch scratch
- Timber. I wouldn't say you're fat, Garfield, but if you went on a diet, two underdeveloped nations would have enough to eat.
- 5-4-3-2-1

- Sorry, Garfield. I wish you'd warn me AROOOOOO
- EROWRRR SHUT UP, STUPID CAT

- You know it's Monday when wake up and it's Tuesday.
- One step closer and I'll put that tongue in a splint.
- You gotta speak their language. Some people say I'm mean, but they never knew my uncle Nick. He used to eat whole chickens.
- But uncle Nick wasn't very bright. One day he jumped an ostrich by mistake.
- His last words were: ""That's the biggest chicken I ever saw."" I'm stuck! I may have to spend the rest of my life in bed!
- POP!
- Darn. Oboy, what a night.
- Don't press it, Garfield.
-

- CHUNG! BARK BARK BARK
-
- I hate mondays. Could it be Jon bought a new pair of slacks?
- Yes, they're new all right.
- No cat hairs. Garfield! I didn't know cats could play guitars.
- Sure, cats are natural guitarists.
- We have built in picks.
-
- Oboy! Pizza!
- Uh-oh.
- Okay, who's in there? Ain't nobody here but us anchovies. tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
- Garfield, leave Odie alone. tap tap tap tap
- tap tap tap tap tap tap A guy tries to have a little fun.
- Garfield will be in here any minute to wake me for breakfast.
- He'll pry my eye open to see if I'm awake.
- Then he will tap dance eon my head.
- And then he'll sit on my chest and breathe in my face until I get up!
-
- OKAY! OKAY!
- What did I do? Look, Garfield. Mom made a sweater for you.
-
- I've never liked your mother.
-
- Oh, Garfield.
- What happened to my candy caramels?
- Mon't mook at meef Look at that beautiful sunset, Garfield.
- It's nice having you to share it with.
- You have something in your eye? Yes, a little speck of sentiment. What's so special about a pet-owner relationship, Garfield?
- Could it be everyone needs someone to lord over? Could be.
- But what do YOU get out of it? You know, Garfield...
- I wonder what people would do without cats? Wither away and die, I suspect.
- I wonder what cats would do without people? who'd change our kitty litter?
- Ha, ha. Okay, Odie.
- Have a steak.
- ZIP!
- Oh, very well, Garfield.
- Have some bacon and eggs, . SPLAT!
- I, Garfield The Cat, resolve to spend the entire week in bed.
- Oh sure, the going may get tough at times...
- But my sheer will and determination should resist the temptation to get up. Spending a whole week in bed isn't as easy as it looks.
- It takes preparation.
- Did you bring the party mix, Pooky? Garfield, are you going to stay in bed all week? Yup.
- Dinner is on the table.
- I think I'm going to cry. Hey, Garfield...figure this one out...
- How do you plan to stay in bed all week and yet come to dinner too?
- Heh heh. Just look at that. Garfield has his bed and his food. He's in kitty heaven. Cats have such simple pleasures.
-
- Spending an entire week in bed was fun.
- But I crave more variety than that.
- Now I think I'll spend an entire week in this easy chair.

- The pain and humiliation I can handle.
- It's losing the air of dignity that kills me.
-
- I'd cry out for help.
- But I couldn't handle that.
- Predicaments are embarrassing only when noticed by someone else. I'm going to get you out, Garfield.
- But I'd like to do it without hurting the window blind.
- It's things like this that let you know where you stand in life. VOILA! One cat out of the blind!
- There's no need to thank me, Garfield.

- What makes you think you're so cute? Simple, ALL kittens are cute until they grow into cats and become ugly.
- I didn't have to hear that. I tell it like it is, baby cakes. I wonder how Nermal can stay so cute after all these years?
- pat pat pat
- I thought so. Mud Pack FOLD FOLD
- Can I play too? Sure...grab hold.
- SLEEP ON MY TEDDY BEAR, WILL YOU?! Z
- Z
- I wish I could do that. Z Garfield, I get the impression you don't like Nermal.
- Nonsense. I love Nermal.
- I JUST LOVE NERMAL! Uh...uh, Garfield. Hey, Nermal. Wanna race to the front door?
- You win. SLAM
-
-
-
-
- What are you doing back in bed, Garfield? It's not even noon yet. As far as I'm concerned, the day is over. Hey, Garfield. Let's spend today celebrating all that's good in mankind.
- Let's do a good deed for a stranger, stop and smell a flower and compliment a friend.
- That's a heavy thing to lay on a cat first thing in the morning. My what a nice looking tie.
- What are you? Some kind of weirdo or something?
- Some people aren't very nice, are they, Garfield? Welcome to planet earth, Jon. What's your philosophy of life, Garfield?
- All the world's a cookie jar, and all the men and women merely crumbs.
- And how do you feel about yourself?
- I happen to be one of the chocolate chips. Isn't it a glorious morning, Garfield? Big, fat, hairy deal.
- You know, Garfield, I have the feeling you're a cat with a little cynic in you. That's not true!
- I'm a cynic with a little cat around me. Maybe Jon's right. Maybe I am to cynical. Maybe the world isn't as stupid as I think.
-
- Nah. Looking good, Garfield.
- You still have it, you rascal.
- An active imagination is a good thing.
- Time passes slowly on a weekend.
- A fly crawls up the wall.
- One of those iridescent flies of fall.
- Time passes slowly on a weekend.
- That's my Jon. He's raised boredom to an art form. Actually, doctor, my cat doesn't need a checkup.
- It was just an excuse to see you again.
- Garfield! I didn't know you cared. No...me, doc...me. Tell me doc, if we were married,
- would you be Mrs. Jon Arbuckle, or doctor Mrs. Jon Arbuckle, or Mrs. doctor Liz Arbuckle, or...
- I hate to see a grown doctor cry. How about a date, Liz? And what do you have in mind?
- I'd love to just hold your hand and gaze into your eyes.
- I like that. It's amazing the headway you can make when you stop playing games. Tonight I am going to take Liz out SOLO. You are staying home, Garfield.
- Where's my favorite tie?
- I get to go with you, and the tie lives. What say we double date, old buddy? Good evening, Liz. I have a wonderful time planned for us.
- We'll have dinner, go to a movie, and many more things too numerous to mention.
- You brought the cat. That was one of the unmentionables. Thank you for a lovely date, Jon.
- kiss
- Yah tah tah tah, yah tah tah tah Human love...it's so glandular.
- Huh, now where could the birds be?
- I was looking forward to a mid-morning snack.
- They must be elsewhere.
- I guess I'll check back later.
- GASP! I'm the kind of person who must see something to believe it.
-
- Yup, Newton was right. Oh no! Pooky! Where's your eye?
- Don't worry, old buddy. I'll get you fixed up.
- There's nothing more pathetic than a teddy bear with no depth perception. What would you like for Christmas, Garfield? World peace.
-
- Seriously though.
- How about another button for Pooky here? And here's something for jolly old Saint Nick.
-
- Ho ho ho. Christmas spirit...
- It's not the giving. It's not the receiving.
- It's the loving. Merry Christmas. What a nice Christmas. I got an eye for my teddy bear, sand for my sandbox, and a new blanket.
- This is what happiness is all about...
- Security. Jon's mother certainly knows how to humiliate a guy.
- This unraveled thread should be my ticket out of this sweater.
-
-
- FREE! I'm FREE!
- click click click Aw, mom. I wonder what today is?
- I'm putting you on a diet today, Garfield.
- Hellooo, Monday. Garfield! You can't eat that candy. It's too fattening.
-
- How many calories can it have for 59 cents? I've discovered the secret to dieting with no discomfort.
- Don't move a muscle.
- Eat no calories, burn no calories. Congratulations, Jon. Your cat has just made dieting medical history. How so?
- He's suffering from sugar withdrawal...
- And grease withdrawal, and starch withdrawal... And withdrawal withdrawal... I HAVE IT!
- I'll make a million dollars.
- Sympathy cards for dieters. Just what is a diet?
- A diet is self-denial.
- Fortunately, I'm such a swell fellow I haven't the heart to deny myself anything. Rise'n'shine, old buddy. Z
- There's a bright new day out there, with new challenges.
- Have some food.
- Have some water.
- YEA, GARFIELD! GET OUT THERE AND LIVE LIFE FOR ALL IT'S WORTH! CHARGE, BOY!
- There's nothing tougher than kick-starting a cat. boing boing
- Ha ha, aren't you cute! Here, have some food.
- I hate myself when I do that. Did I ever tell you about my weird uncle Roy? He had a species change operation. He had himself changed to a dog.
- It was tragic.
- He chased himself to death. Here's how to handle a fierce animal.
- Show no fear.
- And show no pain. If I'm quiet enough I should be able to prepare this lasagna all for myself.
- Hark! Isn't that the sound of a lasagna noodle being laid on a bed of ricotta cheese?
- Uncanny. Come on, come on. Bake that dude. I think I'll do some caterwauling tonight.
- CRASH!
- HOLD IT! WAIT TILL I'M ON THE FENCE, YOU TWIT! For my first selection, I'd like to...
- CHUKUNG!
- Obviously, sir, you are not a patron of the arts! Hello there, Nermal.
- Garfield! Where's Nermal? You didn't stuff him in that breadbox did you?
- Thank heavens!
-
- What kind of an animal does Jon think I am?
- Urf Shut up, Odie.
-
- Garfield! What happened!
- Quick! Get the license number of that dog!
-
- Any sudden moves toward my food bowl can get you into a heap of trouble, boy.
-
- What the... Ribbit. Choose your weapon, Odie.
- We shall now duel with newspapers.
- At one pace! WHAP! Near miss.
- Near miss.
- Direct hit. Okay, Odie, you have your polled up newspaper. I have mine. Let's have at it!
- WHAP!
- Weekend edition.
- BARK! SPLAT!
- I really envy you, Odie.
-
- POW
- Imagine...the first house pet on the moon.
- Good morning...
- ...Garfield. Caffeine makes me nervous.
- Odie! Dogs can't climb trees!
- It's amazing what one can accomplish when one doesn't know what one can't do. How are you boys going to get out of the tree?
- I don't know how I'm getting out of the tree.
- As for Odie... Hey, Garfield, how are you going to get out of that tree!
- Boing! Boing!
- Why, by using my head...and Jon's, and Odie's. Look, Garfield, a robin's nest. You can tell it by the eggs. That's nothing.
- Look over here.
- A cow's nest. Oh-oh. I got a nibble!
-
- Darn, jerked too hard again.
- Here I am in the land of large breakfasts.
- This giant pancake sure tastes good.
-
- What a nice dream.
- Where's my blanket? Grandma, this is my cat, Garfield. Well it'll be! Heavens to Betsy! Land o' Goshen!
- I remember back when all we had were wood-burning cats.
- What won't they think of next?! Bizzare. You know, Garfield, to make it through this old life, you have to be a little crazy. You said it, grandma.
- Why, just look at me.
- I talk to cats. Hello, Garfield.
- Out of the way, dog!
- I think I love you. My Hubby passed away 31 years ago, Garfield.
- I don't know what I would have done without my cats.
- I've wiled away many a lonely hour rocking and stroking my cats. I envy those cats. You're looking a little stiff, Garfield.
- What you need is a lemon tea rub and a glass of hot horse liniment.
- Or is that a liniment rub and a glass of hot lemon tea? Grandma's leaving now, Garfield.
- So long, grandma. So long, Garfield.
- You liked her didn't you, Garfield? Back when they made her, things were built to last. rrrr
- GARFIELD! LUNCH TIME!
- GARFIELD! WHERE ARE YOU?
-
- SCREEE
- It is time for you to eat, majesty. If I must.
- KABOOM
- I hate mondays.
-
- Snack attack!
- Maybe just a sandwich.
- One ham on rye coming up. A banana has two uses.
- Food...
- and entertainment. Look at that beautiful rainbow, Garfield.
- Just think. At the end of each rainbow is a pot of gold.
- There's nothing like a healthy respect for mother nature laced with a little greed.
- I like you, Odie.
- In the catnip again, Garfield? Pooky, with your help we should get Jon's steak dinner tonight.
- Don't worry, old buddy. I'll sew you back up when we're done.
-
- tap tap
-
- Let me get this straight...you say your cat's teddy bear ate your dinner? Biggest appetite for a teddy bear I've ever seen. Eat that or else, Garfield.
- I think I'll...
- else.
-
- Be careful!
- We'll all be killed!
- I haven't started the car yet, Garfield. That's it! Let me out.
-
- I didn't want my sundae to melt while I was eating it. CLICK!
- SHOOP!
- Faster than the speed of dark.
-
- My ivory-stemmed, mother-of-pearl inlaind meerschaum! My blow toy. You know you're a very lucky cat, Garfield.
- You have just about everything a cat could want.
- You have your sanctum sanctorum. My hidey-hole.
- You have your teddy bear. My confidant.
- You have your dog. My scratching post.
- And you have me, your loving companion. My food-fixer and litter box changer.
-
- We must do something about your breath, Garfield. It's not my fault you left the garlic cheese out last night. Rather than fix your breakfast every day, Garfield, I've decided to let you serve yourself.
-
- Maybe that wasn't such a good idea. I don't believe I ate that whole bag of cat food.
- I'd better jog some of this tummy off.
- I really don't like myself when I'm this fat.
- swipe!
- I can't even enjoy the simple pleasures in life. Sit up, Garfield. Sit up.
-
- Sad. Oboy! My feet can touch the floor again!
-
- Garfield, Garfield, Garfield. What a dysmal day.
- I hate rain.
- I hate spiders.
- SPIDERS?!
-
- I hate spiders more than I hate rain.
-
- I hate mondays.
-
- Just staying in shape in case I ever get that hungry. What time is it, Garfield?
-
- What am I doing? A can't tell time. Dear Garfield, My dog chases my cat all over the home. How can I make them get along?
- There's only one sure way to improve their relationship.
- Shoot the dog.
- Okay, Garfield. One bite.
- Cough cough.
- GASP!
- Okay, no more dry cat food. Phobias are funny things.
- I am absolutely fearless except where spiders are concerned.
- Hello, snake.
- How are you?
- Isn't that strange? Spiders scare me, but snakes don't scare me.
- NOW snakes scare me. Dinner is ready, Garfield.
- I moved the table over here. CRUNCH
- crunch crunch crunch
- That frozen pizza would be much better if you baked it first. Here, Odie.
-
- I got you a rubber bone.
-
- smack! slurp!
- You have the manners of a pig, Garfield. Slow down and spit out the seeds.
- rata tata tata tata
-
- What do you think, Garfield? Don't ask.
- There's nothing like camping out in cold weather. That's for sure.
- As the temperature drops, the circulation gets going. And the feet get numb.
- This is nature at her best! I'd settle for less.
- We have everything...our fire, our shelter...
- Our coffee on a stick. What a dismal day. I think I'll stay in bed all day.
- Good morning, Garfield. It's a beautiful day today.
- What a beautiful day. I think I'll stay in bed all day. Hey, Garfield, you know the dog next door? What a loser. A real jerk. I hate him.
- He moved away yesterday.
- A prince of a dog. I'll miss him, The neighborhood won't be the same without him.
- AHCHOO!
- sniff Gesundheit. And now a word from our sponsor.
- ZOOM
- Welcome back. Okay, Odie, you push the cake off and I'll catch it.
- DON'T TIP IT! DON'T TIP IT!
- You tipped it.
- PUNT
- Have you kicked your dog today? Hey, Garfield, my pictures just came in. Whoopty-doo.
- I love pictures. Paper memories of plastic people.
- What's this?
-
-
-
-
- You've been playing with my camera again, haven't you, Garfield? Who me? The Leonardo da Vinci of the shutterbug set?
-
- Z
- Z
- Mmmph fmoph fweef That is correct. It is time to get up.
- MAD DOG! MAD DOG!
- Stay out of my whipped cream, Odie. Garfield has the unique ability to hear a can opener from anywhere in the house.
- Wha...
- Here's a new cat food. See what you think, Garfield. sniff
-
- What are you doing? With all this horse meat, there has to be a pony here somewhere. Odie's asleep and nobody's watching. Z
- pat pat
- I keep my affection in the closet. Z
-
-
- Last one in's a rotten egg!
-
- You first, Pooky.
- Back flip!
- ROWR
- BOOT
- And now for the main attraction. Testing, one, two. Testing, one, two. ROWR
- Can you hear me there in the back?
- Good. I love show business. Gimme the full moon. Gimme the fence.
- KAWHOCK!
- Gimme the broken teeth. Gimme the multiple lacerations. 'cause momma was a great old gallll *MROOW*
-
- Thank you for that large round of indifference. What's the difference between a dog and an eggplant?
- About three IQ points.
- BAP! BOP! BOOP! tappity tappity tappity
-
- Okay...who waxed the fench?
- CHOMP! SLURP! GULP!
-
-
- Z
- Stay out of my dreams.
- peep peep peep peep peep peep
- It looks like there will be a bumper crop of cat food this year.
-
- I wish Odie would finish what he starts.
-
- Bone breath!
-
- Too much rope.
- Don't you dare walk across the table with those muddy feet.
- *
- *
- I must have a blown fuse. I'm gonna have some fun with this boomerang.
- Fetch the stick, Odie.
-
- The dumb cluck will never catch that boomerang.
- GAWANGA!
-
-
-
- It looks as though I'm on another diet. RRRRRR
- ROWR!
- Not good. When I diet, I get mean.
-
- When I diet, I also get weak. Oh, no! Pooky's broken a stitch!
- WAHHHH!
- When I diet, I get emotional. Uh-oh
-
- When I'm off this diet, I'm going to eat lasagna, cake, ice cream, mashed potatoes...
-
- I just gained two pounds! sproing
- FOOM!
-
- boink
- BEEP! BEEP!
- BZT
- Just as I thought. All the warranties expired yesterday. Hey, Arlene, gimme a kiss.
- KISS
- It's time I reevaluated my previously hard-line stand against declawing cats. What say we go find something to eat? Is that all you think about-food?
- Of course not, love...
- This business of sleeping holds a great deal of fascination for me. A real renaissance man. Food, food, food, is that all you think about, Garfield? That's about it.
- So what am I, chopped liver?
- Don't flatter yourself. He certainly knows how to make a girl feel good. Do you know what I like about women?
- They are so soft.
- Come to think of it... PURRR
- PURRR
- Sorry about that, Arlene. Okay, Garfield.
- I caught the mouse and ate it.
- You can open your eyes now. Well, well, what have we here?
- You're lucky this fence is between us, dog.
- Come on, put 'em up.
- Take that! BOP!
- Hey, chicken, come back here and fight like a man.
-
- You had to paint the gate today. SMACK! Let's go for a walk, Garfield.
- It's going to be a beautiful day for a stroll.
- Jon should have been a meteorologist.
- I think Odie's getting a idea.
- * Odie's not too bright. I'm so clever.
- Some bird is really going to be surprised.
- As well as some cat. sniff sniff What's that?
- There must be a leak in the roof.
- If it isn't a leak in the roof, I don't want to know what it is. Would you like a steak, Odie?
- -You didn't say, ""may I?"" Hey, Odie, how about a free trip to Loose Tooth City?
- WHIRRRR!
- I gotta cut back on my follow-through. Z
- Z
-
- Don't worry, Odie, old buddy. I'll get you down. Ork Ork
-
- PTU! POW!
- Close enough. I love television.
- Where else can you see significant world events? Where else can you see the great opera and ballet?
- Where else can you see Lorenzo the Woodchuck race a steam locomotive over Ricky the Rat? Why all this flap about television?
- They say families don't visit anymore...
- Why, that's what commercials are for. I consider television a worthwhile pursuit.
- Why, watching daytime television is even better than...uh...better...than...
- I hate talking myself into corners. Welcome to the Rocky Oxnard
- SHOW
- .... .... .... .. . I always turn the volume knob the wrong way.
-
- I gotta fix that vertical hold. We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor.
- ""Sasquatch""
- Welcome back.
- I just got comfortable, Garfield. Do you ABSOLUTELY have to be let out?
- Oh, yes.
- Very well, then.
- Sucker. Guess where we're going, Garfield? To a hayseed convention?
- Yesiree, we're gonna see mom and dad on the farm. We're gonna slop the pigs and pluck the chickens, boy howdy. We're gonna have us a time.
- That is, if your father doesn't beat the heck out of you for doing that stupid stereotype. Mom!
- Son!
- Son? Mom? How have you been, mom? Never mind that.
- Here, eat, eat, eat.
- You're my kind of woman. Then, once the potato is dug up, it is sliced, deep-fried, salted and bagged. voila, you have your potato chip.
- I hate knowing where food comes from...
- All the magic is gone. Hurry up with that hay, son. Supper's waitin'
- Son?
- Long time, no farm, huh, Jon? We had fun visiting the farm, didn't we, Garfield? Speak for yourself, Jon.
- It's great getting back to basics, putting your hands in old mother earth.
- But I'll never get these fingernails clean. A real man of the land.
- screeee crunch!
- yabba! yabba! yabba!
- sock!
- Human beings...why do they yell at each other? Why do they hurt each other?
- URF!
- What do YOU know? WOING! Just what is a Monday?
- plip
- Monday is a day designed to add depression to an otherwise happy week. Just what is life? Life is a lot like a hot bath.
- It feels good while you're in it.
- But the longer you stay...the more wrinkled you get. Just what is television?
- Television not only gives the eyeballs something to do.
- But it's a socially acceptable excuse to snack. Just what is a goldfish?
- A goldfish is an aquatic expression of beauty and grace that provides its observers with many hours of blissful meditation.
- It also makes a darn fine breakfast. Just what is a dog?
- Let me put it this way...
- If a dog were a faucet, it would leak. Just what is a cat? A cat is a furry animal, complete with dog nibblers and furniture shredders.
- HACK!
- The hairballs in the throat are also standard equipment.
-
- SPLAT!
-
-
- SPLOOSH
- Why is it cats chase butterflies? Is it instinct, or is it just stupidity?
-
- Probably stupidity. YAWN
-
- What happened to you? I got up on the wrong side of the bed.
- CHUG!
- You're a real bear until you've had your first cup of coffee, aren't you? And then I'm the sweetest so-and-so around. Let's go for a walk, Garfield. I'm not going for a walk.
- You're going for a walk. I'm not going for a walk.
- YOU'RE GOING FOR A WALK IF I HAVE TO CARRY YOU! I can't argue with that logic. You really should think about jogging, Garfield. It's 50% mental, you know. It is?
- GREAT!
- Jog, jog, jog, jog, jog, jog, pant, pant, sweat.
- I'll work on the other 50% some other time. I'll cut the lasagna in two pieces, and you take first pick.
-
- It's getting cold, Garfield.
-
- They don't make trees like they used to. *
- (click) EEEEEEEE!
- (click) You know, pleasure motors.
- (click)
- (click) Hi yuh, kids!
- PIC A STATION AND STAY WITH IT, GARFIELD. click!
- blut blut blut blut blut
- When are you going to learn to control that temper of yours, Garfield? The exact same instant they invent an easy pouring catsup. Any cat can use a bottle opener.
- But it takes a real man to use his teeth.
- A real STUPID man. What are you planting, Garfield?
-
- Birdseed? ODIE! CUT THAT OUT! OWOOO
- AROOO
- EROOW
- What this dog needs is a poomp.
- POOMP ROW!!
- EROOOO
- Good morning, Garfield. I'm sorry. Did I wake you?
-
-
- SNAP
-
- BLAT!
- Is it windy out, Garfield? Not so you'd notice.
-
-
-
-

- lap lap lap

- Ah ah ah
- WAH-CHOO!
- sniff Ah ha ah
- WAH-CHOO!
-
-
- I love you, bunny rabbit.
- I love you too, deer.
- I love you all . What the...? I brought some friends home for dinner. Let's see, what should I do this week?
- BARK!
- Bingo. Here I am just swaying in the breeze like so much laundry put out to dry.
- Suspended from a tree limb like an orange ripening in the sun.
- Poetic, yes, but I doubt if it's material for an action-packed mystery thriller. Boy, my arms are getting tired.
-
- Good! Here comes help!
- Hang in there, baby. Ha ha.
- I can see the headlines: ""Cat kills jocular passer-by"". I can't believe I've been hanging in this tree all week.
-
- Now I can.
- Getting out of this tree will be simpler than I thought.
- Hello.
- Haven't we met somewhere before? Perhaps a pasta place in Palermo?
- What's that? Oh no, my dear. Even though you are just a lasagna, I admire you for this mind.
- You know I can't resist you when you wear garlic sauce on your noodles.
- This could be the start of a long and meaningful relationship.
-
- I despise long engagements. Wow. I'm going to be four years old this saturday.
- It's time to reflect upon my accomplishments. It's time to reminisce about good times...
- It's time to lie about my age. Face it, Garfield, you're not getting any younger.
- I wish there were something I could do about the aging process.
- I'd do sit-ups, but I couldn't stand the noise.
- Yawn.
- You know you're getting older when your favorite late night show is the six o'clock news.
-
- It hardly seems possible I'm celebrating my fourth birthday tomorrow.
- BARK! SPLAT!
- Time flies when you're having fun. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GARFIELD!
- GULP!
- Maybe you should have blown the candles out first.
-
-
-
- YAWN
-
- Did you ever have a time when you wish your pets could speak?
- Hello. I'm Nermal, the world's cutest kitten, here to do cute kitten things in order to charm the pants off your owner and point out how uncute you are.
- I hate Monday. Gimme that.
- I fail to see what's so cute about yarn.
- Or kittens for that matter.
- Gee, since Nermal isn't here, I'll eat his food, too.
- Okay, Nermal, go ahead and jump.
- I'll have you out of there in two shakes of a cat's tail.
- Or is that two shakes of a lamb's tail? Come on, Nermal. Let's fight.
- ROWR!
- What a revolting development this is. Let's have some fun, Nermal.
- I'll tie you in nice and safe.
- See yuh.
- SPLUT
- Don't you dare laugh. I hate it when someone has a laugh at my expense.
- SPLAT
- If I laugh, Garfield will kill me. If I don't laugh, I'll burst.
- WAH HA HA HA!
- Ha ha ha, whee.
-
- It's time you go on another diet, Garfield. Just what is a diet?
- A diet is too little of a good thing. A diet is making a molehill out of a mountain.
- A diet is the subject of a lot of stupid platitudes. I hate diets.
- I'd get out of bed to have breakfast.
- But it's not worth the trip. I'm strong. I can handle this diet.
- sniff
- Then why do I feel like I've just lost my best friend? That apple is all you're getting for dinner, Garfield.
-
- Gimme food. Lots of it. And right now.
- Yes, sir.
- Two adjectives never used to describe a cat are: ""wishy"" and ""washy"". I'm bored...bored, bored, bored.
- There must be more to life than this. I'm going to find some excitement.
- YUK!
- You're out of your territory, aren't you, fella?
- Hello there, stray cat.
-
- Where have you been? Cultivating a healthy dislike for excitement. In our fast-paced world, relaxation is practically a lost art.
- Z
- Practically. Here you go, Garfield. Table scraps!
- SPLAT!
- That's dog food. Aren't you cute.
- ROWR!
- Why, you vicious brute! What happened to ""cute""? This is a Garfield push-up.
- Z
- One.
-
- Don't look in here, Jon. It's not a pretty sight. I wish Jon would get married.
- FWEEE
- The only way he knows my dinner is ready, is when it sets off the smoke alarm.
-
-
-
-
- Touch my food and you're one dead dog. My fear of mondays is really childish.
- I must learn to face them like a man.
- You first, Pooky. What's that you say, little fella?
- Oh, very well. I'll hold you.
- Pooky needs me. GOBBLE! SMACK! SLURP!
- GARFIELD! Uh-oh.
- Stay right where you are or the teddy bear gets it. You lead a very special life, Pooky.
- You don't have to fight within dogs. You don't have to sleep. You don't have to eat.
- I feel sorry for you.
-
- I know, I know.
-
- *
- *
- Did you whistle at my girl? No, sir. I didn't.
- ROWR!
- It was my cat! It was my cat!
- Well, I hope you're happy. * It's been a long time since I heard a good ""splut""
- PUNT
- SPLUT BARK! splut
-
- BARK! splut Garfield, I wouldn't say you're fat...
- But Herman Melville wants to write a book about you.
- SPLUT Uh-oh! Too hard!
- Why haven't those eggs come down? Maybe they stuck to the ceiling. Maybe I should look.
- SPLUT splut splut
- blat blat blat
- SPLUT No one knows the trepidation I feel knowing somewhere out there is a ""splut"" with my name on it.
- Oop!
- SPLUT Surprise, Garfield!
- There are prizes at the bottom of the cat food.
- BANZAI!

- tweet tweet Just what is prowling? Let me show you.
- This is walking.
- This is prowling. Nobody knows just why cats love to prowl at night.
- BONK!
- And neither do I. Say there, little lady, what are you doing out on a night like this? Going for a stroll.
- You'd better sty by old Garfield's side. The night is fraught with peril.
- Nighttime is magic to cats. Cats are very comfortable with darkness.
- KLUNK KLUNK
- Especially if their darn flashlights don't work.
- ARRRGH!
- You're supposed to be on my side! What should I do this weekend?
- CLICK!
- I think I'll just sit around and blink a lot.
-
- YAWN
-
-
-
- I hate to eat alone. I hate Monday...something bad always happens to me on Monday. It's just a matter of time now...
- The suspense is killing me.
- DO IT TO ME NOW, MONDAY! GET IT OVER WITH! Life is like a poker game.
- If you don't win...
- You lose. YAWN
- twang twang
- Have you ever awakened with a whisker you just couldn't do anything with?
- BARK
- I hate dogs. It's dinner time, Garfield.
- GARFIEEELD BONG! BONG! BONG!
- You rang? I wonder what this machine is. click
- whirrrr ZIP SPLAT
- It's obviously some sort of cat torture device. The time is right.
- This looks like the perfect spot for a clandestine rendezvous.
- Here comes my double agent now.
- Eeeawwkey, 43, and the letter c
- an infant in your lap may dampen your spirits.
- Uh-oh! It's counter intelligence!
- Down in front, Garfield. QUIET, YOU FOOL! YOU COULD BLOW MY COVER! Hmmm. A hollow stump with a thing in it...I gotta find out what it is. rrrr
- RRRRRRR
- Tuesday. Even though ""curiosity killed the cat"" is just a silly superstition, I must know what's in this stump. rrrr
- ROAR! rip! chomp SNORT!
- Ha ha ha, silly me. I'm going to give that thing in the stump a taste of this rock.
- Munch, munch, ptooey!
- I didn't know stones had bones. burp All right, whatever you are, come out of there! rrrr
- You? A mouse was making all that noise?
- This stump has really great acoustics. I can't believe you were the thing in the stump that's been scaring me all week.
- Why, I'm gonna...
- Down, Guido, down. I've learned my lesson. I'm not messing with things in hollow stumps again. rrrr
- I'm going home where it's safe.
- rrrr rrr Oh, no. It's show time!
- Some day I'm gonna be the greatest caterwauler in the world. They're gonna call me ""Cats Wauler"".
- ROWR!
- CHUKONG!
- AROOO
- WHOCK!
- Why do you do it, Garfield? Dues. I'm just paying my dues. crunch crunch crunch
- I know you're hungry, Garfield. crunch crunch
- But what say I boil that spaghetti first? It is a tad firm. I'll see you later, Garfield. I'm going to the supermarket.
- Let's see...I have my shopping list, my keys...
- Don't forget your shopping bag. Supermarkets are like a giant United Nations of Food.
- You have coffee from Brazil, cheese from France, beef from Australia...
- And lasagna from heaven. One frozen lasagna.
- Two frozen pizzas.
- One frozen pasta freak. Whew! Last trip.
- GULP! SNORT! RIP! MUNCH
- DARN YOU, GARFIELD! Now I have to go back to the store. Not on my account, really. Oh, boy, do I love food.
- If I couldn't eat food, I'd just die.
- Sage, Garfield, sage.
- Holy moley!
- Here, boy, sniff.
-
- CHOMP
- RRRRRRR
- Dogs, you can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em. I'm hungry...nah, I'm too tired to be hungry...nah, I'm too depressed to be tired.
- Yup.
- It's Monday. Rats...I can't shake this deep blue funk I'm in.
- No doubt about it...
- This week is gonna be one long Monday. Oh boy am I depressed. I'm fat, I'm lazy, nobody likes me...
- Good morning, ol' buddy. It's another beautiful day.
- Quiet. I'm on a roll. Nobody likes me. What's the matter with you, Garfield?
- I SAID NOBODY LIKES ME! WHOCK! BONK!
- Nobody likes me, and nobody listens anymore. I'm starting to lose my depression. I gotta do something.
-
- Much better. I love you, Garfield. Leave me alone. I want to be depressed.
- Tickle! Tickle! Tickle! Hee hee
- Feel better, Garfield? I'll get you for this, Jon.
- It seems like I've been lost in this jungle for days with nothing to eat.
- I'd eat berries, but there's no sugar and cream.
- Where's a four-star french restaurant when you need one?
- FOOD!

- Dr. Livingston, I presume. Look out, world! Here comes the caped avenger!
- Oh, sure, super-hero crime fighters make for an old, overused story line...
- But have you ever heard of a fat, weak one? The caped avenger steps into the seamy underworld and reasserts his noble code.
- ""I will seek out evil wherever it may lurk and destroy it"".
- Unless, of course, there is the slightest possibility of harm to my person.
-
- dribble dribble dribble The caped avenger must pummel this evil dog.
-
- dribble dribble dribble
- The caped avenger displays a rare show of compassion. The caped avenger spots some evil that must be severely dealt with.
- WHAM! BIFF! BAM!
- The caped avenger would be a more effective crime fighter if he didn't have to use one hand to hold his cape up. This cape is the source of my power, the source of my identity.
-
- The source of my security. *

-
- Oh my, what a beautiful baby!
- Normally I don't like babies...
- But this one is special.
- I'm such a sentimental slob. This week I'm going to change my ways. I'm going to begin by no longer hating mondays.
- I'm crazy about mondays. I just love mondays.
- Now I'm only fond of mondays. I resolve to stop being fat, lazy and cynical. I shall now rise at an early hour.
-
- Z As long as I'm improving myself this week, I might as well try to get along with Odie.
- Come here, Odie. Give me a big hug.
- Yuk. I shall now use sheer willpower to resist eating that hamburger.
- Unnngh
- WAH! I'm beginning to worry about Garfield. This self-improvement bit is beginning to bug me. I feel like a goody-two-shoes.
- Maybe my old personality wasn't all that bad...
- The gluttony, laziness and cynism lent a little texture. I'm sick of this self-improvement kick.
- I'M FAT, I'M LAZY AND I'M CYNICAL!
- I admire that in a cat.
- WHAP!
- chuking
- Catch, Garfield.
- BONK!
-
- Ever have a day when your timing was all off? OH, NO!
- I am DEFINITELY not getting out of bed today.
- Not on Monday the 13th.
-
- Yuk!
- Although cats are finicky eaters...
- ""Hunger strike"" isn't exactly in our vocabulary. fwip
-
- I don't understand you, Garfield. Where's your sense of adventure?
- Gimme that hamburger.
- You get a lot more accomplished if you do it with authority.
-
- rrrrr rrrrr
- roof meyow
- RAWF! FFFT!
- BARK! ROWR!
- MROWR
- BARK
- You win.
-
-
- splat!
- A very short but neat rain shower.
-
- Pardon me, which is the way to Cincinnati?
- Thanks.
- I see by the ol' writing on the wall it's time to check myself into the funny farm.
-
- Look at all those tiny ants going to the tiny beach to do some swimming.
- Uh-oh. A tiny minnow is cruising in to eat the swimmers.
- Uh-oh. The minnow just got harpooned by an ant who bears a striking resemblance to Robert Shaw. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- WHAM! WHAM! I don't like the sound of this.
- Surprise, Garfield! What have we here?
- We now have two houses. A big one and this little one. A regular Taj Mahal.
- One of us is going to live in the big house, and one of us is going to live in the little house. That's fine with me.
- You may visit me in the big house on weekends. OH NO! IT'S NOT THERE!
- I'm not getting out of bed without it!
- Not without my morning cup of coffee! Good morning, Jon.
- Well, helloooo there. Come to papa.
- That's me, Jon Arbuckle, second fiddle to a coffee bean. Garfield, you'll never find happiness at the bottom of a coffee cup.
- I beg to differ.
- Look, there's some right there in the corner. By golly, you're right. Take it easy on that coffee, Garfield.
- It might be too much for your tiny system.
- Pardon me, boy, is that the chattanooga choo-choo Bingo. I love you, coffee; you make me glow.
- You make me smile. I love you so.
- My nerves don't like you, but what do they know? Now for a strong cup of coffee.
- Now for a good night's sleep.
- Now for a brisk bout with insomnia. What's that rumbling? The ground is shaking!
- Oh, no! It's THEM!
- THERE'S NO WAY OUT! I'M TRAPPED LIKE A RAT!
- ARRRGH!
-
- ARRGH!
- Very funny, Odie. Now get your face off the window.
-
- ROWR I got you a new friend, Garfield. He even talks. Oh, goody.
- Will you play with me? Why, of course, little buddy.
- Let's go play with Jon's power tools. I wonder what that bag of sawdust has to say.
- Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me.
- He does have a certain charm. Imagine, the nerve of Jon giving me a dummy as companion. What kind of an intellectual dwarf does he think I am?
- Practice of the Aristotelean mean would have a significant positive effect on the world institutional environment.
- Oh, shut up. Your little friend here is certainly cute, Garfield.
- stomp! stomp! stomp!
- Little friend or not, there's something to be said for the diplomatic removal of competition. What's this?
- Here's an interesting article about the ancient practice of cannibalism. Lovely.
- Can you imagine what life was like then?
- Traveling salesmen were called ""meals on wheels"".
- Having the boss over for dinner had an entirely different meaning.
- It says here certain tribal societies also ate cats.
- I can hear a diner complaining, ""oh, waiter, there's a flea collar in my soup"". That's not funny. Maybe I wouldn't hate mondays so much if I didn't have this calendar here to remind me.
-
- That hamburger is mine, Garfield. It's mine.
- Let's see if you want it after I stomp it, lick it and shed on it.
- You win, Garfield. You can have it. I don't think I want it now. POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!
- Let me guess. You're going tree climbing, right?
- How did you know? Now to get out of this tree.
-
- Don't you dare! sniff sniff I wish you understood my every word, Garfield.
- I could tell you I love you. I understand how you feel.
- I love me, too.
- I love it when you cuddle up to me, Garfield.
- What a warm and wonderful gesture. My nose was wet.
-
- SMACK!
- HEY!
- tickle tickle tickle
- STOP IT, GARFIELD! YOU PLAY TOO ROUGH!
- I'm sorry I yelled at you, Garfield. Cats have feelings too, you know. I'm not leaving bed, I'm not moving a muscle. If I don't bother Monday, maybe Monday won't bother me.
- Hello, I'm Nermal, the world's cutest kitten, here to visit for the week.
- Well, maybe I will do just a teensy bit of sobbing. The mirror is one of cat's best friends, Nermal. You can primp in it, play with it and admire yourself in it.
-
- I don't see what's so great about it. Follow me, Nermal. This is how you climb a tree.
- Now what do we do? What a silly question.
- We sit here until the fire department comes. lick
- LICK
- What happened to you? How cute. Thank you, Nermal.
-
- Uh...thanks. You'd better appreciate it, sucker. Your flower garden gave its life for this bouquet. Tell me, Garfield, are you threatened by the fact that I am much younger and cuter than you are? I'm bigger than that.
- You can say that again!
- See how they like your rapier wit on the moon. Hello.
- I wonder what kind of hat this is?
-
- What time's that there bus leaving for Topeka?
- See you, mum. Billy Bob and me are gonna play in traffic.
- Gee, I'd love to go to the cotillion but I gotta stay home and watch armwrestling on TV.
- That's it. This must be one of those stupid hats. Get ready to go, Garfield. We are going to visit dad and mom on the farm.
- Send my regrets. I really must stay home and pluck my nose hairs.
- I guess I'm ready to go. SPUT SPUT WEEEZE GURGLE SPUT
- The car has stopped and it's getting dark. What should I do, Garfield? I con only think of one thing.
- MAKE IT GO We're stranded, Garfield. We'll have to find somewhere to spend the night.
- What about that place? Cute.
- A little paint, a few curtains, and it would be a regular love nest. I guess we'll have to stay in this abandoned house tonight, Garfield.
- Garfield R.I.P. 6-19-78 10-30-82
- I can't put my finger on it, but I have an uneasy feeling about this place. This house is spooky, isn't it, Garfield? Kind of reminds me of the vet's office.
- Uh-oh, footsteps! Quick! Into the closet! CLOMP CLOMP
- What do you suppose it is? CLOMP CLOMP Let's hope it's the welcome wagon. CLOMP CLOMP It's coming to get us, Garfield. It knows we're in the closet! -ARRGH!
- DAD! You didn't show, so I came looking for you. One life down, eight to go. *
- If I disguise myself as a bird, I should be able to get close enough for an easy lunch
- Glue gluk gluk gluk

- swim fins
- waddle waddle
- It's nice to be back in the country with space to roam.
- Space to breathe. Space to be me.
- Space to be BORED! I think I'll have an egg for breakfast.
- crack!
- Mommy! Maybe chicken for lunch. Mommy!
- Look, kid, I'm not your mommy. I'm a boy. Boys can't be mommies.
- Daddy! What's that, daddy? It's lasagna. And don't call me daddy.
- Here. Have a piece. Yuk!
- NO SON OF MINE WOULD REFUSE LASAGNA! Stop hanging around me, kid. Just remember, you're a tender young chicken and I'm a very hungry cat.
- I guess I have that little giblet the what for.
- EYOW! For the last time, kid, I'm not your daddy. You're a chicken and I'm a cat.
- Now go back to your mother. Goodbye, daddy.
- Let's job, Garfield. I'll sit this one out, thank you.
- pppppp
- RRRRRRRRR
- BARK! BARK! BARK! SHOOP!
- ROWF! FFT!
- ARRRRRRRRGH! BARK MROW! Pack your bags, Reba. The neighborhood's gone strange. GARFIELD'S LAW: Cats move at a speed proportionate to the amount of food at their destination. They may even exceed the speed of sound.
-
- Meow. GARFIELD'S LAW: Cats are independent. Cats are loners...
-
- They are underfoot only when you're carrying groceries. Sorry about that. GARFIELD'S LAW: Cats instinctively know the precise moment their owners will awake...
-
- Then they awaken them ten minutes sooner. GARFIELD'S LAW: Cats are naturally attracted to only one type of human being...
-
- The type who is allergic to cats. WAHCHOO! GARFIELD'S LAW: Cats can't hear commands... Garfield! Get off the bed!
- Cats can't understand cajoling... See? Even Tommy the Clown likes his new cat food.
- But they do sense when you want to take them to the vet. Let's go for a ride, Garfield. GARFIELD'S LAW: Cats shed in direct proportion to their contrast with a person's suit.
-
-
- How about a shot of flea powder, Garfield? If you can hit a moving target.
- SCREEEE
- I guess it's safe to eat.
- GOTCHA!
- I guess I pulled a good one on Garfield.
- Guess again, sucker. I hate mondays.
- And just why do I hate mondays?
- Because mondays hate me. There's one thing I hate worse than grapefruit.
-
- And that is hating grapefruit. I hate mornings.
- I hate the fuzzy feeling. I hate the cold floors.
- I hate the bad breath. I hate cute.
-
- I also hate people who try to ingratiate themselves. chuking KONK!
- I hate toasters.
- chuking KRONK I hate hating things.
- Check that.
- I love hating dogs. PUNT! Here we are at the veterinary clinic, Garfield. I prefer to think of it as the chamber of horrors.
- I wish doctors wouldn't leave their instruments sitting out.
- Just as I thought, it's icy cold.
- I wonder what she intends to snip off with this?
- I don't even want to know where this goes.
- Hello, Garfield. ARRRGH!
- He's fainted dead away. He's daddy's little trooper.
- Oh, gee. I can't get into my bed with these muddy feet.
- Z I love to sleep. I sleep to restore my energy.
- I sleep to refresh my wits.
- I sleep to escape.
- Z
- Garfield! What happened? I had a nap attack at full throttle. If I were to come back to this earth, I'd like to come back as a pillow.
- I could lie in bed all day.
- And people would put their heads in my lap and go to sleep. UH-OH! HERE COMES THAT MEAN DOG!
- Nobody would ever harm a sleeping cat?
- Wrongo.
- Z Z
- Z Z My feet fell asleep. Z
- Z dum dee dum dee dum
- Yah tah tah tah, yah tah tah tah TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP
- Garfield, I was sound asleep. You're breaking my heart, now feed me.
- Anything else, sire? Yes, wash my blanket, change my kitty litter and retread my scratching post.
- I wonder if it's worth it. I'll ignore that remark.
- I swear, sometimes I don't know why I keep him. SNAP! SQUEAK! What's that?
- Oh, no! Since I'm not a mouser, Jon set a mousetrap. Now it's killed a mouse!
- If you did your job, I wouldn't be in this fix. I'm sorry you got caught in that mousetrap, mouse. Oh, that's okay. I have a wife and eight kids.
- What doest that have to do with anything?
- This is the first peace and quiet I've had in years. Have a piece of cheese, mouse. Maybe that will make you feel better.
-
- How am I supposed to swallow? Good point. You're free to go, mouse. Thanks.
- Just where have you been? I suppose you and your fat friend have been having fun while I've been working and slaving taking care of our children. You'd better get yourself home right now.
- SNAP! Now get out of here.
-
- SNAP! SQUEAK!
- Jon will be checking this trap soon.
- My bunny slippers? They like to roam at night. ALL RIGHT!
- I love flowers!
- I love to tiptoe through tulips.
- Dive through daisies.
- Romp through roses.
- You cat broke 'em, you bought 'em, buddy. Put some pansies on the tab, too. Don't knock those flowers of the windowsill, Garfield.
- I put them there to give them some sun.
- And some fresh air. Windows are great. They offer a front row seat to life's passing parade.
- THUD!
- They are also good for a yuk or two. I see you're bringing the mail in with your usual care.
- This letter says, ""do not fold, spindle or mutilate.""
- It didn't say anything about ""maul"".
- MY NEWSPAPER! YOU CHEWED UP MY NEWSPAPER!
- It's things like this that make me wonder if you should bring in the paper at all. Precisely. poo On chilly mornings, this is my favorite place in the whole house.
-
- Over the heat vent. Garfield, did you eat fern?
- WHY IS IT I GET BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING AROUND HERE? IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, YOU JUST LAY It ON OL' GARFIELD!
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- You can have this hamburger if you can reach it, Garfield.
- WHA!?
-
-
- b-b-b-b-b-b-b
- Jon will rue the day I got these rubber arms. BOOM BOOM BOOM
- boom boom boom
- It's time you went on another diet, Garfield. On this diet, Garfield, you may drink all the coffee you please.
- gulp gulp gulp
- This is some kind of weird diet. slosh slosh slosh slosh I think I'll step off my diet just long enough to eat a couple dozen cookies.
- Lettuce?
- That cat has no sense of humor.
-
- You know you're on a diet when even the dog food commercials look good. You may go off your diet as soon as you loose some weight, Garfield. Why didn't you say so sooner?
- BUZZ
- Let's eat. Heck with it. I'm going off my diet.
-
- Show me a dieter, and I'll show you a person who belittles himself.
- Good morning, Garfield. I'm so happy you can share this glorious morning with me.
- Michelangelo would give up painting in a minute if he saw the canvas mother nature has rendered just for us today.
- Chirp chirp Just listen to the symphony of sound from nature's flute section.
- And the perfect sights and sounds are perfumed with these lovely flowers. What do you think, Garfield?
-
- You really don't care, do you? Bingo. Good morning, Garfield. Is there something you're trying to tell me?
-
- It's the Christmas season, you say. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
- GIMME! GIMME! GIMME! GIMME! GIMME! GIMME!
- I'm getting into the Christmas spirit.
-
- That's gotta be a world's record! The presents go there. Move it, move it, move it. I hope this gift is mine. rattle rattle rattle
- CRACK! tinkle tinkle tinkle
- I hope it's Odie's. It's only noon, Garfield. Are you going to bed already? The sooner you go to bed, the sooner it's Christmas morning.
-
- Good night, little fella. Comics readers are very special people. You mean more to me than there is space here to express.
- I love you all.
- Have a happy holiday. I'll be funny again tomorrow, trust me. Set the stage, light the lights.
- Good evening, ladies and germs.
- SPLAT
- My car is so old, it is insured against fire, theft and India raids. BLUT
- My girlfriend is so cross-eyed, she can sit on the front porch and count the chickens in the backyard. CRASH
- Take my dog...pleeeze. PLOP
- It must have been one of your better nights. I was in rare form. Well, I wonder what's going to happen to me today.
- BLAT!
- Monday moves in a mysterious way. Go fetch the paper, Garfield.
- Look closely, Jon. These are cat's paws, not slave's paws.
- I'll ignore your small indiscretion this time, and share your life. Thank you...sir. nibble nibble nibble
- It's not to chew your nails, Garfield. Oh, that's okay.
- I'm chewing on Odie's. Z
- I'm bored. I need to add some sparkle to my life.
- Z THERE'S A SPIDER! I HATE SPIDERS!
- Ha ha. I'll just flick him away.
- WHANG!
- Jon? Are you okay? ...Jon?
- ZOOM!
- The early cat gets the jelly-filled donut. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
- zzzzzzzzzz Shoo, fly!
- zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz I HATE PESKY FLIES!
- zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz UNNGH!
- zzzzzzzzzzzz DIE, FLY!
- zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ROWR
- Feel better, Garfield? I think I hurt myself. BRINNNG!
- WHAM!
- BRINNNG!
- I didn't know that you like to dance, Garfield. What are you talking about?
- I was scratching my back with your toothbrush. Good morning, Odie.
- Hey, get away from Jon's stamp collection!
- Too late. What should do tonight?
- SPLUT
- Good idea. I think I'll go sing on the fence. OH, NO! FIRE ARROWS! THOCK
- I'M A GONER! THOCK
- A CAT ALWAYS GOES DOWN WITH HIS FENCE! I can't believe that tacky pack of music haters burned my fence down.
- The only thing to do is to get right back up there and start singing again.
- But...somehow it just isn't the same. Here he comes...tweedledee, the wonder dummy.
- Hey, Odie, would you like to play ball?
-
- squeak
-
- tie tie
- Hey, Garfield, where's Odie? He's tied up at the moment. dribble dribble dribble SLAM
- Hey, Garfield. I'm home.
- You're certainly excited to see me. Believe me, inside I'm hopping up and down and shouting with glee. So I say to this clerk, ""Look, if the whole bunch of bananas is 54 cents, why can't I have one for 6 cents?
-
- Don't you want to hear how the story came out? Tell it to your plants.
-
- Garfield, you seem to be preoccupied this week. Huh? Garfield hasn't been listening to me lately, watch this.
- Hey, Garfield, what say we go to the vet and get you declawed?
- That would be fine. Case closed. I hate it when Garfield ignores me.
- DARN IT! PAY SOME ATTENTION TO ME!
- Z I think I'm going to cry. Jon, I know I've been ignoring you lately, but I want to say it's not because I don't care for you.
- It's like my ears hear you, but my brain keeps straying off course. I've just been preoccupied.
- Enough said. Let's get on with it. Huh? ZOO
- Do Not Feed The Animals I wonder what it would be like to be a wild animal.
- First, I'd alter this stupid sign. Feed the Animals
- Then I'd pace around looking kinda fierce.
- Then I'd scare the heck out of the crowd.
- SWIPE EEEEK!
- That was a pretty convincing performance, if I do say so myself.
-
- I love it when they entertain me. It appears Jon has prepared himself a very nice meal, but something is missing. What could it be?
- Why, of course...
- The cat hair!
-
- Okay, okay, I'll turn the heat up. This is my humble abode, my dear.
-
- Who were they? Oh, just a couple of animals I'm giving away soon. Garfield, sometimes I think you don't like it when I have dates. Absolutely.
- Dating leads to marriage. Marriage leads to children.
- And do you know what children do to cats? Hey, Jon, what's happening?
- Eat your breakfast, Garfield.
- Where's your sense of humor? *
- Isn't that Halley's comet?
- ZIP!
- Garfield, did you take my steak? Who? Little ol' me?
- Look, I don't have your crummy old steak.
- HEY! I DON'T HAVE YOUR CRUMMY OLD STEAK!
- I'm going to get you for this, Odie. Burp. Playing with a ball of yarn is a great way to get attention.
- THOCK!
- GARFIELD! Tah dah. Hey, Garfield, there's a lasagna under the bed!
-
- Thanks for dusting under the bed for me, Garfield. I hate you.
- WHIRRR!
- nightie-night, Jon. I hate you. Surprise, Garfield! I brought you another rubber mouse. Yippee skip.
- By the way, what happened to your last one? It was tragic.
- He was caught and eaten by a rubber cat. Surprise, Garfield! I threw your old bed in the trash and got you this new one. What do you think?
-
- Z Dogs have the world's stupidest toys. Just look at this rubber bone.
- Simple minds, simple pleasures.
- It certainly doesn't hold the scintillating intellectual challenge of my fuzzy scratching post wit the springy rubber mouse. *
-
-
-
-
- ROWR! ARRRGH!
- THAT WASN'T FUNNY; GARFIELD! Funny is in the eye of the beholder. plop!
- EEEEEEK!
- I'm almost afraid to ask what happened here. QUICK! QUICK! PUT POOKY'S ARM BACK ON!
- Relax, Garfield. I'll fix Pooky right up. It's no big deal.
- No big deal?! Look, buster. I've never lost a loved one before.
- I sewed Pooky's arm back on as good as new, Garfield.
- Yes, but will he ever play the piano again? Me thinks the cat doth expect too much. You did a pretty good job of sewing Pooky's arm on.
- I used small stitches so as not no leave a scar.
- I think he's picking on me. Pooky, when you lost your arm, I got to thinking about our mortality, and that's depressing.
- So promise me you'll never lose your arm again, okay?
- I wonder what my fortune cookie is.
- Today you will be whisked away to a large white building where all you have to do is lie in bed all day as lots of people pay attention to you and bring you food.
- That sounds too good to be true.
-
- I can stare anything down.
-
-
- Uh, Garfield, fish can't blink.
- Now he tells me...now that my eyeballs are all dried out? I wonder what awful thing is going to happen to me today? Maybe the sky will fall. Maybe Odie will bring his long lost twin brother home...
-
- Or worse yet, maybe Nermal will come for a visit. Oh sure, you're getting all the attention right now, Nermal, But when you grow up you'll be as unloved as I am.
- I'm never growing up. Who are you? Peter Pan or something?
- I'm a midget. Some cats get all the luck. If you want to be cute like me, you have to play wit a ball of yarn. That sounds simple enough.
- Yours is over there.
- I hate him Nermal, you're so sweet, why don't I just stuff you into this sugar bowl.
- Go ahead and try it, fat boy.
- Say, Garfield, Where's Nermal? At a humility lesson. You disgust me, Nermal.
- You're a wide-eyed, mindless, little piece of fluff. You're so cute everyone loves you.
- Eat your heart out, bozo. I am, I am. Unk. You've overstayed your welcome.
-
- Where's Nermal? You know...I was strange, he muttered ""unk"" and then left without a word. And just when I thought it was safe to go back in the kitchen.
- Garfield, why don't you like to take baths? Bathing robs cats of precious natural oils that protect us from skin disease.
- What do you know? Hop in there right now. Let me get my tubby toys.
- Today, today.
-
- There now, don't you feel much better? Much. Are you sure you want to watch this, Garfield?
- It's a depressing movie about a man-eating lion that terrorizes a native village.
- You root for your side, I'll root for mine. Lion. I hate movies about man-eating lions.
- How can an animal possibly prey on an innocent victim?
- Explain that to the chicken you had for dinner. OH, NO! THE LION RAN DOWN ANOTHER VILLAGER! The original fast-food franchise.
- Now what disgusting is the lion doing?
- He's spitting the spear out. Tell me when the lion is finished eating the villager, okay, Garfield? You can look now.
- EEEEEK!
- He wasn't done yet! Oh, I thought you meant the MAIN parts. GOOD! They shot the lion!
- What do you think of those apples, Garfield? Big deal.
- At the gun it was villagers:1, lion:42. Well, what do you think of the man-eating lion movie?
-
- You know I hate that, Garfield. That ice should be good for some yuks.
- Ice, one. Odie, nothing.
- Watch this.
- Air mail!
- Have a nice trip, Jon!
- OH NO!
- MY TOMATO PASTE! Z
- BARK!
-
- Oh, a heat vent.
- The next best thing to my sunbeam.
- Jogging is much more enjoyable if you have the proper motivation.
- Ding Dong ICE CREAM I'd better save some of this blueberry pie for Jon. To eat it all would be inconsiderate and selfish.
-
- I am what I am. This is called a bird feeder, Garfield.
- And this is called putting birdseed into the bird feeder.
- He can call it what he likes. I call it baiting the trap. WOW! LOOK AT ALL THIS GOOD FOOD AND NEAT CLOTHING!
- This is great stuff.
- Stay out of the trash, Garfield. How did you know? Oboy! Jellybeans!
- These green jellybeans are pretty tasty.
- I don't care if they are Jon's favorite, I'm going to eat them all.
- Why, hello there, Odie.
- Here, you may have the last green jellybean.
- Aren't I sweet?
- My last green jellybean! I'm going to kill you, Odie! The plot thickens. I hate mondays.
- Maybe if I tore mondays off the calendar there'd be no more mondays. RIP!
- There must be an easier way to eat.
- GO AHEAD AND START WITHOUT ME, BREAKFAST.
- Burp...I should have thought of that long ago. What a unique perspective. Noe the ceiling is the floor and the floor is the ceiling. Hi, Garfield.
- ZIP
- Whatever goes down, must come up. I wonder whose glasses there are.
-
- Pablo Picasso's. I feel good today. I feel strong.
- I feel invincible. I feel as tall as a skyscraper.
- Get off there, King Kong. ayieeee *
- Hop up here, Garfield. It's dinner time.
- ""hop up here,"" he says. I feel like a change of pace.
- I think I'll move in slow-motion today.
- Wha!?
-
- Oh, no, you don't.
-
- It's hard to take what you want in life when they see you coming. Uh-oh, there's a package for me.
- I don't think I'm going to like it.
- Beware of gifts bearing air holes. Gee, I hope this package doesn't have a bomb or a monster in it.
- GASP! IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN MY MOST HIDEOUS FEARS!
- It's another sweater for me from Jon's mother.
- scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
- I hate wool sweaters.
- There is one thing I like about this sweater.
- Z
- There's more than one way to skin a cat.
- TWANG
- Check that...CHOKE a cat. I hate designer sweaters.
- Look at this.
- The lizard chewed the armpit out of it. Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo PLOP
- Garfield need a better balanced diet. So I'm disguising this liver as dessert.
- Why, hello, Garfield. I fixed a yummy treat for you.
- I call it ""Sweet Surprise""
- He'll be surprised, all right.
- ARRGH! He ate it! He ate it! Surprise. Hey, Garfield, look at what I got at the barber shop.
- Th-dah! What do you think? It's tacky, tasteless and disgusting.
- It's you. Bingo!
- Hook shot!
- Ha-ha-ha, Garfield, ha-ha-ha
- Jon sure looks dumb with this fake mustache.
- Very few people can wear a mustache.
- Like evil Roy Gato, for instance. Nyah, nyah, nyaaah, evil Roy Gato does his daily dirty deed.
- push
-
- The mustache made me do it. Oh, there you are, Garfield.
- Let me guess...you stole my fake mustache and ate my spaghetti, right?
- How'd you guess? Give me a kiss, sweetheart.
- KISS
- How do you tell a lady her mustache needs more wax? This looks like a good spot to rest. I never saw a spot that wasn't a good spot to rest.
- Well, Garfield, here we are in the great outdoors. It's outdoors, all right, but I'd debate the ""great"".
- Just listen to the sounds of nature. Sounds like noise to me.
- Nature can actually speak to you, you know. Go on. Hear that? Nature is speaking to you now. Wait, I do hear something...
- I HEAR IT! I HEAR IT!
- Nature is saying, ""Garfield the cat, you're a long way from your warm bed and television set."" COME ON, MONDAY! DO IT TO ME NOW! THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!
- THOCK
- Thank you for your prompt consideration. Did I ever tell you about my uncle Nick? He loves to destroy things. He can shred a recliner in 12 seconds...
- Mangle ferns by the carload and turn a set of china into powder in the blink of an eye.
- He is presently a postal employee in Chicago.
- Nice try, Garfield, but I don't buy your stupid watermelon disguise.
- RATA TATTA TATTA TATA
- Don't make fun of Odie, Garfield. That's not nice.
- That's even less nice. Come and get it, Garfield.
- CRASH!
- Your not a sailplane, you know. Oh, shut up. Dinnertime, Garfield!
- BANZAI
- * I hate dogs and dogs hate me, I chase the tiny ones, the big ones chase me.
- Do Not Open This Gate! Hello, what's this?
- That's an open invitation if I ever saw one.
- Of course, it may not be wise to open the gate.
- But that never stopped me before. I'll just take a little peek.
-
- Curiosity mangled the cat. PUNT
- This is turning out to be a decent Monday for a change.
- POOMP! gobble gobble gobble
- Garfield, you eat too fast. No, I don't.
- I'm just overqualified for the job. Garfield will never reach this pie up here.
- CHINK
- And just where are you going? For my morning scale? ARRRRGH!
- What a horrible nightmare! I dreamt I was a dog.
- Thank goodness it was only a dream. scratch scratch scratch No more of this sniveling sissy stuff.
- I'm getting out of this tree like a man.
- On the other hand, sniveling does have its attributes. I gotta get out of this tree.
- Oh well, they tell me a cat always lands on his feet.
- However, THEY failed to mention the pain.
-
-
-
-
-
- We must have lunch sometime. Things aren't always as they seem. Hey, Garfield, let's take a vacation.
- We'll go someplace tropical.
- Save your money. Go sit in your aquarium. Vacation is going to be so great, Garfield.
- We'll get away from this rat race. There'll be no hassles.
- A change of pace would be nice. Hey, Garfield, what do you think of this shirt for our vacation?
- Tah-dah! That's awful.
- Do you know how many turkeys were destroyed to make that shirt? Good news, Garfield! The airline has a special allowing children to fly free. So?
- So when you leave on vacation, you can pose as my son and ride up front. I will not demean myself by dressing up as some stupid kid.
- Otherwise, you'll have to ride in a kitty carrier in the baggage compartment. DADDY! I hope you don't mind flying, Garfield.
- Some animals don't travel well. Nonsense.
- If a dog can be a World War I flying ace, I can surely fly commercial. Just bear in mind, Garfield, even though we're leaving on vacation...
- And even though we're going to have fun...
- It's always nice to get back home. This is going to be fun, Garfield. Ha ha ha, wheee.
- I think you'll like flying. I'd like it if I could keep one paw on the ground.
- Oooooh, I think I'm getting airsick.
- What's that? It sounds like a wing cable fraying!
- I SMELL SMOKE! sniff sniff
- WE'RE GOING DOWN IN FLAMES!
- We're still on the ground, Garfield. GREAT! CATS AND CHILDREN FIRST! Tell me, Garfield.
- Are you nervous about flying?
- I take no chances. I think you'll enjoy flying, Garfield.
- It's a very comfortable and smooth way to travel.
- Then what are these little bags for? The easter egg hunt? No pets allowed. This is my son. He has a body hair problem.
- How old are you, sonny? Rowr.
- That's baby talk for ""one going on two"". crunch crunch
- What do you think of airline meals, Garfield? GULP
- The only thing with food content was the plastic fork I just ate.
-
- The captain has advised that the ""Fasten Seat Belt"" sign be observed in case some slight air turbulence is encountered. Well, Garfield, how did you like your first airplane ride? Aside from the nausea, cramps and indigestion, I'm fine.
- Have a nice day. HAVE A NICE DAY?!
- LET HER LIVE, GARFIELD! LET HER LIVE! Ah, this is the life, isn't it, Garfield?
- For real relaxation, it's hard to beat the tropics. Oh, go sit on a sandburg.
- You should go play in the surf, Garfield. Maybe next year.
- There are fish out there, you know. Well, why didn't you say so?! Ha ha ha.
- Simple cat, simple pleasures. Do you know what I love about the tropics, Garfield? I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
- It's the miles and miles of sparkling beach.
- It may be a beach to you, but it's just a sandbox to me. There's one thing I love about the tropics. grrrr
- FLIP!
- The tiny dogs. You don't seem to be having a good time, Garfield. A keen observation.
- What's the problem? I tell you what you do.
- Find the biggest, heaviest fur coat you can and put it on. Then go lie in the blazing sun for a few hours and see how many youks you have. Tell me, my little wahine, what do you do? I'll bet you walk along the beach all day, then go home to your little thatched hut at night, right?
- I'm a computer programmer from Cleveland.
- Close. How about a date? He didn't even blink. This is the life, isn't it, Garfield? More fun than a cat should have.
- Nothing to do but lie here in the sun. Listening to your brain bake.
- Are you bored, Garfield? Is there sand in your swimsuit? This is going to upset you, Garfield...
- Because I know you've had a great time.
- But it's time we think about going home. La la la
- There's nothing like a bubble bath to cure what ails you, Garfield.
- pop pop
-
-
- POW! Hey, Jon, what happened to you guys? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Dear Garfield, what is your favorite all-time film?
- It's ""Old Yeller"".
- I love movies with happy endings.
-
- And just what do you think you're doing? Asserting my cathood? Garfield, why is it cats like to get out at night?
- That's when we like to sing on fences.
- In the daylight, we'd be easy targets. Today is thursday, and that's lasagna day.
- Here's your cat food, Garfield. Will there be anything else?
- Let me jog your memory. Why do you have such large teeth, Garfield?
- All the better to eat you with, my dear.
- Stop that! Obviously, sir, you are not a patron of the classics. I saw an awful movie last night called ""Alien Dog."" It was about this gigantic mutt that terrorized the world.
- However, they did dispatch him with a rather clever ploy.
- They electrified a 12-story fire hydrant. This looks like a good day for some heavy thoughts.
- Let's put this whole thing in perspective.
- Eating is important.
- And sleeping is important.
- But nothing is more important than holding someone you love.
- Check that.
- Reciprocation is nice, too. You're too fat, Garfield. Hang it in your ear.
- Oh, shut up, Odie.
- Why do I have the feeling there's a conspiracy afoot? *
- ARRRGH!
- It's diet week. It's diet week.
- I gotta get off this diet.
- It's starting to mess with my mind.
-
- Release my hand, Garfield.
- You release hamburger, I release hand. Suicide, exercise and dieting.
- RIP!
- Name three forms of self-abuse. True...how true.
-
- *
-
- Oh, no! My watch has stopped!
- I've missed Garfield's mealtime.
- Pets have a way of letting you know when you've missed their mealtime.
- You're late. I know, I know. Tell me, Garfield, when you walk, do your right and left legs travel together, or do you use your opposing legs?
-
- I'll never walk again. Z Z Z I wonder how birds can sleep in trees without falling out.
- Z Z Z
- Z Z Z Aha! ...hammocks. This is the only way to spend a sunny afternoon.
- All you need is a swimming pool.
- And a good imagination. I'm going to take a dip in here, so beat it, bird, before I break your beak.
-
- I have a mouth with a death wish. Take my advice. Sun yourself in a pool. You stay cooler that way.
- I shall now turn over in order to tan my back.
- This is not well thought out. As much as I hate to do it...
- I'd better get out.
- Even my fur is getting wrinkled. Look at those stupid dogs.
- Yabba yabba yabba.
- ROWF! BARK! BARK!
- BARK! YIP! BARK!
- Go away, dogs. Leave my cat alone.
- bbbbbb
- You just had to get in the last lick, didn't you, Garfield? Me and my big tongue. Hey, Garfield, guess what! We're going to visit dad and mom on the farm this week.
- We'll eat some of mom's down-home cooking and help dad with the farm work.
- Good thinking, Jon. Let's drive all the way to the sticks and fetch us an apple pie and a hernia. Your brother, Doc, has come back to work on the farm. He's here now.
- Doc boy! Don't call me ""Doc boy"".
- Jon boy! Mom boy! Doc boy! How are you? Oh boy. What brings you to the farm, Jon? I promised Garfield some good home cooking.
- What would you boys like for breakfast?
- My guess is Garfield would like some ham and eggs. Doc, you're looking more like dad all the time.
- You take that back!
- SMACK! Hush up, boy. The three stooges live. You know, Doc, for brothers, we don't look much alike.
- It's hard to believe we came from the same place.
- You mean, the farm? The funny farm maybe. Take care now. See you soon. Don't be a stranger.
- So long! Bye bye! Bye now. Se yuh.
- I can't believe the fuss they make over going to bed. You have a very close family. skitter skitter skitter
- That's odd...two little bugs in full Shakespearean dress.
- Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? I'm right here, Juliet. I bring bad news, Julie baby. Our families are feuding and don't want us to date anymore. Oh no!
- That does it! Let's die in each other's arms and live together in eternity. How do we do that?
- Here's how. squash
- I'm not one to fool with great literature. Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me.
- Hi, Arlene. Hi, bozo.
- I'm sure she meant to say, ""Hunk"". Let's go mousing. What's wrong with lasagna?
- There's no thrill of pursuit.
- Obviously, you've never snatched one off the table during sundae dinner. Why do girls always so good, Arlene?
- We wear perfume.
- Sounds kind of sissified to me.
- I get this from a sex that likes to tattoo themselves. What does the moon remind you of, Garfield?
- The moon reminds me of night, and that reminds me of sleep, which reminds me of breakfast...
- That wasn't what I had in mind. Then, after breakfast, comes my nap... I'm taking you to a great restaurant tonight, Arlene.
- bonk bonk Look, galvanized, not one of those cheap plastic places.
- Now I've seen it all...a three-star garbage can. I'll see you, Arlene. It is customary, in human circles, to kiss a lady's hand.
- You're not a human, and that's not a hand. That's a hairy paw.
- Oil and water, nitro and glycerin, chivalry and realism.
- I have a new plant in here, Garfield. Yum yum.
- And I don't want you messing with it, okay? Sure.
-
- First I think I'll eat its tender little leaves, then I'll pick my teeth with its stems, followed by stomping the rest of the plant out of existence.
- Prepare to die!
- How did you like my cactus, Garfield? Prepare to die. I'm going out to a very nice restaurant tonight, Garfield. So you be good while I'm gone.
- And, no, you can't come with me.
- Who said I wanted to go to your crummy restaurant, anyway? Jon is going out without us tonight, Odie.
- So you know what to do...
- You chew his slippers and I'll destroy his chair. GARFIELD! LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO MY CHAIR!
- I DON'T DESERVE THIS!
- I was only gone for the evening. Now I know the face. Weren't you a former owner of mine? Garfield, I know being a cat owner is a big responsibility.
- BUT I SHOULD Be ABLE TO LEAVE FOR AN EVENING WITHOUT YOU DESTROYING EVERYTHING!
- I WANT A DIVORCE! I get half of everything.
- squirt
- OKAY! WHO GREASED MY WIENER? Hey, Garfield, What do you think of the new turtleneck sweater mom made you?
- You're right.
- It isn't very flattering, is it? I'm in a ""what if"" mood today.
- I wonder what would happen if I married Arlene.
- We'd have a huge wedding...
- Then we'd raise some kittens...
- And they'd crawl all over me.
- Forget it! I'd make a lousy father. Garfield, it's noon. Are you getting out of bed?
- I'd love to get up...
- But the blanket is extra heavy today.
- Think about a big, juicy bone, Odie.
- Z
- Z
- Z Garfield, meet my new pet frog, ""Herbie"".
- Isn't he great? Yeh, good ol' ""Herbie"".
- Good ol' ""your days are numbered as soon as Jon turns his back, Herbie"". zzzzzzzz
- Hey, Garfield, when was the last time you saw my pet frog, Herbie? zzzzz
- SNAK! At lunch. It seems like an age since I gave Odie a boot.
- BOOT!
- I'm just a sentimental fool. Something's wrong.
- Hey, Garfield! Let's have some fun! forget it, Jon.
- I want to take you to an Italian restaurant for a lasagna dinner. No way.
- They have ferns for dessert. Big deal.
- Then we can come home and I'll hold Odie down while you beat him up. Try and make me.
-
- How did you know we have an appointment at the vet's? I don't know. I just know. In this box, I have a singing and dancing mouse. I have spent four years training him. He will now entertain you.
-
- I guess I should have cut air holes in the box. It's hard to believe I'm going to be five years old this sundae.
- Shucks, golly, gee-whiz, ratso.
- I'm going to have to start watching my language. Garfield, I hope the sun shines on your birthday.
- What a nice thing to say.
- I'm going camping. I didn't need that.
- Mother nature has certainly been kind to you, Garfield.
- I wish I could say the same for father time. They say the first thing to go on a cat is its hearing.
-
- Or was that eyesight? Your birthday gift is inside the card, Garfield.
- Someday, my signature will be worth a lot of money!
- sssh
- This is the perfect surprise. It's much too early for Garfield to be up.
- He's a year older today, you know.
- SURPRISE!
- -And a year sneakier. BARK!
- FUMP!
- Amoeba Man strikes again. Amoeba Man goes in search of food.
- BONK!
- Amoeba man should probably cut eyeholes in his exoskeleton. Amoeba Man spies food, but Amoeba Man has no mouth.
- munch munch
- A wonderful thing, osmosis. Ooooh.
- Amoeba Man should not have eaten that hamburger so fast.
- I have a nucleus ache. Amoeba Man stops to admire himself in the mirror.
-
- Face it, fells. you're one good-looking hunk of protoplasm.
- Amoeba Man falls in love.
- If I may be so bold, you have a great-looking pseudo pod, my dear. Hello.
- You can tell a lot about their family from their garbage.
- They have an infant who just outgrew its baby clothes.
- The father recently gave up golfing.
- And the mother cooks lots of pasta.
-
- Adopt me! Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- Dr. Livingstone, I presume. Slow down there, ace.
- Slow down, in deed.
- Jon doesn't realize how much I have to eat to maintain my figure. Bark! Bark! Bark!
- Garfield, get out of the cookie tin.
- WHANG!
-
- Garfield! You ate my raisin cookies!
- I thought you didn't like raisins.
- I don't. Shoo! Shoo! Go away! I don't like you.
- SLURP!
- I hate blind devotion. How about a manly game of arm-wrestling, Garfield? You're on.
- Are you ready, you furry sissy? Ready when you are, wimp.
-
- Unnngh Rrrr
- What say we call it a draw, Garfield? I'll let you off the hook this time.
- I'll see you, Garfield. So long, Jon.
- Speak to me, arm! I'll never ruse this arm as long as I live. Garfield! I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I say we attack the fort at dawn. I wonder what this is.
-
- Ah, a booby trap.
-
-
- There you have it...
- Odie's so stupid, he doesn't even understand the law of gravity. They say hammocks are very relaxing.
-
- Big deal.
-
-
- What do you think of my Ming vase, Garfield?
- CRASH!
- Min, Shming, they don't make'm like they used to.
- WHA!... GUH!... I DON'T!... BUH!... YOU!... YOU!
- YOU DUMB ANIMAL! YOU'RE SO STUPID, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID!
- I know I
- destroyed a priceless Ming dynasty vase as an overt expression to communicate my contempt for the politically oppressive doctrines of their early 17th century administration. I could sure use some of Jon's deodorant.
- ssst
- How's it going, Garfield? fine, until I found the spray starch in your cabinet. Go fetch the paper, will you, Garfield? That's what i live for.
- Here you are, sahib.
- Hey! This paper is all chewed up! Sahib asks fish, paper is wet. Sahib asks cat, paper is holey.
-
- WAH-HA HA-HA! I hate it when they do that.
- slup slup slup
- Drool fuel. Aw...how sweet.
- Wait a minute! I'll bet you want something from me, don't you?
- How dare you suggest I trade my affection for selfish reasons! For a bite of that hamburger, I'll forget you said that. Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- Arf? *
-
-
-
- I am about to outdo myself.
- WHAP! Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- Pardon me, sir. Have you seen a tail here around? You don't like me, do you? I like you.
- No, you don't. I'm crazy about you. I love you.
- Now why don't you go play in the blender? SEE? Why don't you like me? You're young and you're cute.
- If I were old and ugly, would you like me? Possibly.
- This must be one of the things cats do when they think there are no humans around. Where's my cane? Where's my cane? I hate to do this.
- I don't know how I'll get out of this tree.
- But at least I'll be away from Nermal. What are you doing up here? Did you come to save me?
- No, I just came to visit.
- Well, talk fast. I was just considering leaping to my death. How do we get out of this tree? We jump.
- If that little twerp can jump, so can I.
- Z
- Rise and shine.
- Time to get up, Jon.
- I'm hungry.
- This ought to wake him up.
- Jon must really be socked out.
- I wasn't about to give him the satisfaction. Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- You'll have to speak up. I can't hear you over the band.
- Gee...uh, thanks, Odie. clunk!
- What is it, Garfield? I'd wager it would have been easier to recognize before it wandered into traffic. Here comes Odie. His bark is worse than his bite. Bark! Bark!
- BARK!
- And his breath is worse than his bark.
- SPLAT!
- Spaghetti can turn on you when it's wounded. Oh, boy! I love to sluck spaghetti!
- SLUCK!
- Sorry about that. SLUCK
- There's only one irritating thing about slucking spaghetti...
- The whiplash. Hey, Garfield.
- I have a big date with Liz tonight. What do you think about my outfit?
- Mmmph
- Hee hee hee
- I don't have to take this. WAH-HA-HA-HA!
- No cat's going to make a fool out of me. Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- If you must know, I am a rare carnivorous fern, and if you don't mind, I'd like to finish eating your cat in peace.
- HA-HA! YOU DIDN'T GET MY FOOD THAT TIME!
- SPLAT
-
- You've been reading ""Alice in Wonderland"" again, haven't you? You must be psychic. RRR
- RRR!!!!!
- I want to know why you did that, Garfield! That's not half as interesting as how I got up there to begin with. Garfield, I want you to get all the mice out of this house, right now! Oh, very well.
- Be a good boy and call my attorney, will you?
- And have him serve them with an eviction notice.
- ARRRGH!!! B-B-B-B!
- Cats are so unpredictable. Predictably so. CATCH THAT MOUSE!
- Garfield, why don't you eat mice like other cats? I don't like to hurt mice. How can I get that through your thick skull?
- *
- Dear Jon: The mice and I have an agreement. They don't bug me and I don't bug them. Therefore, I will never hurt mice...signed, GARFI*
- GARFI*************** tick! tick! tick! The key must be stuck.
- WHAM AAAWK!
- Sorry about that, fella.
- OH, NO!
- My legs re shrinking! I've really done it this time. My belly has outgrown my legs.
- I guess there's only one thing to do...
- Get fitted for stilts. * Hummm *
- Oh, no!
- You know you're overweight when you're sitting around rocking, and you realize you don't have a rocking chair. Garfield, you're getting dangerously overweight.
- How dangerous can a little extra fat be?
- Who, blub, would, blub, have, blub, guessed? Don't worry about your condition, Garfield.
- You can still lead a useful and productive life.
- As a paperweight, a doorstop, a... Put your face closer to thee claws. Rats! The dog next door!
- Ever had a nightmare come true? * Hi, hi, Daisy-Waisy. Would you wike some wa-wa? Oh boysy-woysy.
- If you speak nicely to plants, they grow better, Garfield. Bologna.
-
-
- DIE!
- Live and learn.
- RIIIP!
- Cruelty is second nature to that cat.
-
- Diet time. Rats. Happy diet, Garfield. Here's a banana for breakfast.
-
- Bang! As long as you're dieting, Garfield, why don't you exercise, too?
- Sure...why not?
- As long as the noose is around my neck, I might as well jump off the horse. Sticking to your diet, Garfield? Yup.
- FUMP
- But I did eat the pictures out of your cookbook. You're looking slim there, Garfield. Thanks.
- I couldn't find a corset.
- So I borrowed one of Jon's tube socks.
-
-
-
-
- They say we can visit him 2 to 4 on saturday. Food gone! Food all gone! I can't possibly eat all this food. It's time for a...FOOD FIGHT!
- SPLUT!
- You stay out of this, Monday. Hallo, folks. How do you do? I'm Garfield, the cat. I'll entertain you.
- SPLAT!
- You stay out of this, mom. I just flew in from Pittsburgh and, boy, are my arms tired.
-
- The guy on the hook must be asleep. I gotta sing! I gotta dance!
- BAP! BOP! BIFF!
- I gotta be crazy. Goody, Jon's not around.
- Jon stifles my lifestyle.
- Put the dog down! He's no fun.
- ZIP!
- I don't know how we does it, we jus' does it.
- splut
- plik
- bat
- scratch
- drip
- Bored, Garfield? Some days I get tired of being a cat.
-
- That wasn't very nice, Garfield.
- In this business, ""nice! doesn't put bread on the table. Why is it I'm crazy about you, Garfield? Probably because I'm perfect.
- You claw the drapes, shed on the furniture, steal my food and hassle the dog.
- Nobody's perfect. Garfield's in for a surprise. I put an alarm on the refrigerator.
- That's the first rule for successfully living with a cat.
- You must be smarter than the cat. Given the choice, Garfield, would you rather be rich or famous?
- You're talking to a cat here, fella. All I need is a warm lap, some good food and a little attention.
- I guess a cat wouldn't care about either. I'd rather be rich.
-
- Any last words, Garfield? How about ""Gotcha""? Here's some salad and dressing, Garfield. You may mix them to your taste.
- gluk gluk gluk
- How was it? Could've use more dressing. Fire Destroys House
- It's time you boys learn where the fire exit is.
- In case of fire, go straight to your swinging pet door, got that?
- I'd better give them a little test.
- FIRE!
- Clever me. Jon must be cleaning the heating grate. I wonder what grates are for, anyway.
- OOPS!
- Obviously, they're to keep one's house from eating one's cat. Silly me had to fall into the heating vent. Now here I am, residing deep within the bowels of my house.
- Forced to spend my remaining days fending for myself in the tin tunnels of the duct work, the solenoid jungle of the wiring system and the polyvinyl chloride playground in the crawl space.
- Hey! I think there's a book here somewhere. Meyow!
- GARFIELD! WHERE ARE YOU? I'm in the plumbing.
- WHAT CAN I DO? Just don't flush the toilet. Hey, Odie! I'm trapped in the heating vent. Help me out!
- A hacksaw-great!
-
- Unnngh
- Garfield...where are you? Down here in the floor's joists, plotting your untimely demise. Free at last!
- There is something to be said for brute force.
- It is usually followed by brute stupidity. Z
- BARK!
- grrrr
- slurp!
- Z
- ZIP!
- You can growl in my face, you can lick my head, but if you touch my food, consider yourself dead. Whew, not much room left.
- I'll have to decide between the blueberries or cheese for dessert.
- I hear the blueberries are lovely this time of year. Why haven't I ever seen talking food before? Because you're as dumb as your look.
- Oh, yeah? Touche.
- I can't believe I'm talking to a cheese. I wish I were a cat instead of a mouse.
- Never be ashamed of what you are. We must all accept our plight in life and make the best of it.
- You're not on the business end of the food chain. Good point. I have a confession to make.
- My mother was a lemming. What's a lemming?
- A gerbil with suicidal tendencies. My condolences. So you're half lemming. Yes, my mother always had the urge to cast herself off a cliff into the sea.
- AWK!
- Darn you, mom. What the heck are you doing?
- I'm half lemming, you know. So?
- I'm getting back to my roots. I had to ask.
- If you eat this pie, I'm going to kill you.
-
-
-
- GARFIELD! YOU ATE MY PIE!
- One of the great criminal minds of your time, I ain't.
- Rats.
- I used up my eating energy on the getting here. I'm tired of being out of shape.
- I can't catch Odie. I can't catch my breath.
- Heck, I can't even catch my lunch. I really don't like myself when I'm out of shape and overweight.
- Well, this time I'm going to do something about it!
- I'm going to lower my expectations! Come on, Jon! Up and at'em!
- There's a fresh new day out there. Are you going to join me, or are you going to lie there and wither away?
- There's nothing worse than a born-again jogger. hop hop hop
- hop
- Leg warmers. Get on your mark, get set...
- Jog!
- The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. It's going to be a scorcher today.
- The sidewalk is already hot.
- OOCH! EECH! OUCH!
- Oog! Argg! Ick!
- Garfield! What are you doing on this hot sidewalk?
- Why don't we go inside?
- What? And disappoint my public? CLINK I'm not one to brag on my teddy bear, but you are not going to believe this.
- Okay, Pooky, pay attention now. Are you ready?
- Play dead! I'm getting too old to have a teddy bear.
- It's not that I feel silly...
- It's the peer pressure. Pooky, I have to start weaning myself from you. I gotta make it out there on my own.
-
- That's good enough for the first week. I have to break this teddy bear dependency.
-
- I've made it a whole day without my teddy bear, but if I don't cuddle something soon, I'll go crazy.
-
- This sweat sock just isn't the same. POOKY!
- So much for kicking the teddy bear habit.
- It's unnatural to be near someone you love and not hold them now and then. I don't believe my eyes!
- I've finally found the perfect skipping stone! The perfect weight, perfectly round and flat, everything.
- But there are no lakes around here, and it's too far to the river.
- Darn it! I've got this stone begging to be skipped and no place to skip it!
- *
- KONG!
- Hey, look! The perfect skipping stone! I hate it when Odie gets caught outside in the rain.
- Not that I care that much for Odie, mind you.
-
- Here's one of the great mysteries of the universe...
- When Odie closes his mouth, where does his tongue go? I wanted to buy you another bed, Garfield. But the only sizes they came in were small, medium and large.
- They didn't have showboat!
- A quick wit is best accompanied by quick reflexes. I love a well-balanced meal.
- Something from the four basic food groups...
- Meat, vegetable, dairy and catsup. Garfield should be finding that rubber hot dog in his bowl right about now.
- And he should be coming for me right about...
- Now. I think I'll have pancakes for breakfast.
-
- Once again our nation's criminal element has callously disregarded the truth in packaging laws. Ho with a capital hum.
- I wish I could kick this industrial-strength depression I have today.
-
-
-
-
- Mother nature, if you had a body and a face, I'd give you a hug and a kiss. Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me.
- Hi, Arlene.
- I said...""Hi, Arlene"". Hey, Arlene. Guess how much weight I can press.
- I'll bet you don't know. I'll bet I don't care.
- Right now I'd trade all this strength for just one snappy comeback. Hey, Arlene. Look at this. So what?
- Just what does it take to impress you, lady? A challenge to my head as well as my heart.
- As soon as she regains consciousness, I'll challenge the heart part. It's my dinnertime, Arlene. But don't despair, I'll be right back. The moments will seem like years till you return.
- I don't know how she does it...
- How one well-turned phrase from that woman can suck all the wind out of your sails. Arlene, I'm sick of the witmatching mood you're in.
- Okay, I'll stop it. There's no battle of the intellects here anyway.
- You're right. It was kind of like swatting a fly with a buick. How about a kiss, Arlene? What kind of animal are you?
- A cat!
- AUUGH! I did it! I did it! She said, ""what kind of animal are you?"" and I said, ""a cat!"" Isn't that pathetic?
- Odie, all you ever do is stare and slobber.
- You're too happy, and that's not healthy.
- People don't trust a chronically happy person.
- Who could possibly love a grinning idiot like this?
-
- YOU STAY OUT OF THIS! Oh, boy, am I down today.
- You look down today, Garfield. But I think I'm even downer.
- I hate one-downmanship. I am down...down, down, down, down, down.
- Down, down, down, dooby doo down, down.
- Comma, comma, down dooby doo down, down. I'm so depressed it's depressing. Tell me about it.
- I think I'll go out and shoot myself. Sure.
- You're just trying to cheer me up. Why are we so depressed, Garfield? I have this theory.
- We've been staying up too late, lately.
- And being happy takes entirely too much energy. We've gotta do something about this depression, Garfield. Check.
- Maybe a change of surroundings would cheer us up. Check.
- Wrongo. Check There's only one way out of this deep blue funk we're in, Garfield. I hate to do it, but it has to be done. I hope it works.
- Ooch! Eech!
- Tah-dah! Bingo!
- click HEY!
- click I was watching ""Cheerleader High!.
- click Well, I'm watching ""Wonder Cat""!
- rip
- CRASH
- I was much more passive before I became a wonder cat cadet. Hello, folks. I'm here to entertain you! Are you glad to see me? ---well, are you?
- Okay, I can take a hint. Who needs you anyway?
- I DO! I knew a cat who was so ugly, he had to tie a squirrel around his neck to make the dog chase him.
- BAP! KONK!
- It's nice to see I'm attracting a crowd with some taste. I knew a dog who was really stupid...
- He was so stupid, when he turned around to lie down, he had to stop to ask directions!
- I thought that was better than a one-shoe joke. What do you get if you cross a cat with a doctor?
- You get a cat with a low golf handicap.
- BONK KONG! Did you hear the one about the bucktoothed chicken?
-
- He...uh, raised a lovely family, was a well-respected member of the community, and led a comfortable life, titty boom. Stop me if you've heard this one.
- SMACK KONG! WHOP! BAP!
- Let me rephrase that.
- We are nearing the bewitching hour when evil forces well up within me.
- I love it. EEEK!
- Gargle snort drool YIP
- Heh, heh, heh-another fruitful Halloween of scaring kids and dogs.
- Rats.
- My mom told me if I made this face too often, it would freeze in this position. Here's some chicken soup, Garfield.
- No thanks, I really couldn't.
- I've never known Garfield to refuse food.
- I'm taking this steak and there's nothing you can do about it, Chipmunk Cheeks.
- I've always encouraged Garfield to be assertive. But I believe he's crossed the fine line to obnoxious. BONK! BONK!
- BONK! BONK!
- Odie's going to have to learn to walk one of these ways. I wonder what pets do when they don't know their owners are watching.
- Let's find out.
- I don't believe it. Neither do I. Odie just drew to an inside straight. CLANG!
- Hey, Garfield, how do you like my new dinner bell?
- It got my attention.
- Oh no! My legs are turning to jelly! My mind is turning to mush! Could it be a laser? ...a death ray? No! It's...
- My sunbeam. This looks like a good place to sit and muse.
- What is the thing called life, Odie?
- Montaigne said, ""The value of life lies not in the length of days, but in how we make use of them.""
- Holmes said, ""Life is painting a picture, not doing a sum.""
- James said, ""Be not afraid of life. Believe that your life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact.""
-
- poo Odie, sometimes I envy you. Hey, Garfield, we're going to visit aunt Gussie.
- I know she's old and mean, but underneath she has a heart of gold.
- I hear she used to double-date with Lizzie Borden. Hi, aunt Gussie. Well if this isn't my daydreaming nephew, Jon, and his cat Blubberbutt.
- Look, rodent breath, if you come within ten feet of my canary, I'll make a doily out of your hide.
- I like her. Why, aunt Gussie! I didn't know you were homecoming queen in 1922. You bet.
- Back then I had beauty, style, grace, charm...
- And a body that wouldn't quit! How are you getting along financially these days, aunt Gussie?
- Oh, I have my social security, I make quilts and sell my African violets...
- And I knock down three hun a week teaching slam dancing at Denny's Pogo Pit. What would you like for Christmas, aunt Gussie? Oh...nothing much.
- Maybe something for my bed like a little lacey throw pillow.
- Stuffed with John Travolta's chest hair. It was nice visiting with you, aunt Gussie. Same here, Jon.
- And you'd better forget about your crush on John Travolta. He's young enough to be your grandson.
- DON'T TELL THAT TO MY COMPUTER DATING SERVICE! click!
- Well, look who's in the television set.
- Garfield is such a clown.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- WAH HA HA
- Wait a minute!
- Something just occurred to me. Look at all those people. All going to work to process food, produce electricity, manufacture kitty litter and so on.
- All just for me.
- I'd thank them individually, but they know who they are. Odie
- WHOCK! SPLAT
- That's for not being a cat. I guess I shouldn't have clobbered Odie for not being a cat.
- If everyone had a choice, we'd all be cats. So I can't blame him for not being a cat.
- This is for being a dog! punt! whirrr
- glup plop
- How's your cat food, Garfield? I could say more for the presentation. Oh, look, it's one of those things you pull on for service.
- YANK!
- Bring me a danish and a cup of coffee.
- Stop playing with your food, Garfield.
- I'm not. It dried out while my face was in it. This looks like a good place for a little nap-nap.
-
-
- click WHIRRR
- GASP!
- SPLAT!
- Hello, mom? The washing machine just spit out my jockey shorts. That's one thing I'd never admit to my mother. Here you go, Garfield. Take a big bite.
- OH NO!
- Just kidding.
- SLAM! Yo, Garfield! What'cha doing?
- Casting a critical eye on a career as a doorstep. Sitting atop this door, I see all and know all.
- Now where's that fat cat of mine?
- Don't take my name in vain. SMACK! Perching high on a door gives vent to a cat's philosophical bent.
- Observing life from an omniscient point of view allows one to witness fascinating human rituals.
- Like Jon cleaning his ear. squeak squeak I wish I knew how to get off this door.
- Sometimes it would be nice to have all the decisions made for you.
- SLAM! and sometimes not. PLOP
- Where did you come from, Garfield?
- Rumor has it the stork brought me.
-
-
-
-
-
- They didn't call me the shimmy king for nothing. I hate mondays. I can't shake this awful feeling that something dreadful is going to happen to me.
- I'm saved! It's nice to see a friendly face.
- You're going to the vet, Garfield. ARRRGH! You don't look happy, Garfield.
- Happy about going to the clinic? Put yourself in my shoes.
- You get to flirt with the lady vet while I get the business end of her thermometer. Did you know I'm a medical curiosity, doc? I'm not surprised.
- I'm missing a major organ. Your brain?
- My heart, you've stolen it away. I hate to see a doctor cry. I'd like to make another appointment, Liz. Sure, when?
- How about Friday night for dinner?
- NO! Subtle but firm. Your cat is in good health, Mr. Arbuckle. Dandy. Now let's talk about us.
- Let's do. Really?
- You owe me forty dollars. I just adore love patter. Hi, Odie.
-
- If that dog's brain were a car, it would be jammed in neutral. GASP!
- OH NO! WE'RE OUT OF COFFEE!
- This is your fault, you guzzler! You didn't buy any!
- Look at us, Garfield. We're getting irritable and shaky. We need coffee!
- SNIFF...WHAZAT?! ZAT!S COFFEE!
- EEEK! LOOK, HUBERT! PEEPING TOMS! Don't flatter yourself, Reba. Now go hide the silver. It's time you earn your keep around here, Garfield. There's a mouse hole and there's some cheese. You know what to do.
- I certainly do.
- Here's the scenario: cat crouches by cheese waiting for mouse to exit hole to retrieve same. Cat catches mouse. Fade out. The End.
- Heck with it.
- I prefer stories with a happy ending. Why should I have to catch an innocent little mouse? I have nothing against him. In fact, he's kind of lovable.
- If you don't catch that mouse, I'm putting you out i the cold!
- The furry twerp dies. This is demeaning. I have a noble heritage. I am a unique, vital individual.
- And all I'm considered as around here is a mousetrap.
- I must speak to my kitty litter changer about that. I don't want to catch that mouse. He's cute. I've even nicknamed him...
-
- ""Stretch""
-
- Live and let live, I say. * _ I'm just a ramlin' kind of guy...ramlin', ramblin'
- rambl
-
- Oh, no! I've heard terrible things about city sewers!
- They say the pet alligators that are flushed into the sewers grow to huge proportions.
- But this is ridiculous. OH NO! DON'T MAKE ME DO IT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!
- TURN BACK! TURN BACK!
- Sometimes, a cat's feet just gotta climb. Here I am, stuck up a tree. Things couldn't be worse.
- Okay, okay, NOW things couldn't be worse.
- BOOM I maybe stranded up a tree...
- But at least I'm on a sturdy limb.
- The story of my life. Hey, fatso. What does a bird like you eat?
- Cats.
- chirp chirp This isn't safe.
- Shoo! Shoo! Somebody might get hurt!
- TOING! A way down! All I have to do is dive into that birdbath.
-
- 7.0 6.5 Uh-oh, I feel a sneeze coming on!
- Wah, wah.
- WAH! WAH! WAH!
- WACHOO!
- Auntie em! Auntie em! Yeah, I got you, my pretty, and your little dog, too. 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hope that St. Nicholas soon would be there; FILL THIS ONE, SANTA!
- The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugarplums danced in their heads; NOW GIMME A VISION OF LASAGNA
- And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. THIS IS MY KIND OF STORY. When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. WHAT'S A SASH?
- The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the luster of midday to objects below. When, what to my wondering eyes should appear. But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer. THEY LOOK BIGGER ON TELEVISION.
- With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. OR MAYBE SANTA CLAUS. More rapid than eagles his coursers they came. And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; ""Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen! ON, DOPEY! ON, SNEEZY! ON, HAPPY!
- ""To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all! CAN'T THEY JUST WALK ANYWHERE?
- As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the housetop the coursers, they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too. TUNE IN TOMORROW. THE GOOD PART'S COMING. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. OH, NO! A CHIMNEY MONSTER!
- He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. YOU DIDN'T BREAK ANY TOYS; DID YOU?
- His eyes-how they twinkled! His dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow; HE ALSO HAS A WELL-ROUNDED PERSONALITY. The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth. And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed, like a bowiful of jelly. HO! HO! HO! A FEW SIT-UPS WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT, FELLA.
- He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf. And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. WE MUST HAVE LUNCH SOMETIME.
- He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, and laying his finger aside of his nose. And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; HOW DID HE DO THAT? He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like to down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, are he drove out of sight,
- HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! WHAT A NICE GUY, WHAT A NICE STORY.
- Have a happy and loving holiday season.
- Merry Christmas, Garfield. I got you some great presents!
- Here is a radio controlled mouse...
- And a mink scratching post!
- ptoo
- Odie, that bone is everything you own in the world.
- It's the expensive gifts that impress me. Heh he rattle rattle
- Cats have such active imaginations. I wonder what's going on in Garfield's mind right now.
- Well...here I am, in a brown paper bag. Interesting.
- Residing in a brown paper bag gives one an all-new perspective of one's self.
- I feel like a dirty magazine. This bag needs eyeholes.
- rip rustle rustle
- Something's not right here. Got my sack, got my eyeholes, what more could a cat need?
- ARRRRGH!
- Armholes, definitely armholes. Awk! There's someone in this bag with me.
- Oh, it's you.
- Hello, bellybutton. fffff
- POW!
- I didn't know you were in the bag, Garfield. I was playing a trick on Odie. At least I died for a good cause. Oh boy, what a party, I ate too much.
- I gotta get up and exercise. Here I go.
- Okay, here I go o the count of three...one, two, three and up!
- Up...up and exercise. Come on, Garfield. You can do it.
- This time I'm really going to do it. Here go the legs lifting the body...now!
- This time I'm really, really going to do it...one, two, three...Hi ya!
- Have you been up today, Garfield? I think so. Rise and shine, Garfield, It's a bright new day!
- It's gonna be a wonderful day, a great day!
- I think I overcheerfuled it. How do you want your coffee, Garfield? Make it sit up and bark.
- How's this?
- Just right.
-
- Oh, no! It's the old ""Disguise the tongue as a loaf of french bread"" trick! Okay, who loosened the top on my saltshaker?!
- Garfield, that wasn't very nice. You're right, that wasn't very nice.
- But it was extremely funny. Go outside and play, Garfield.
- Have a good time.
- ""Have a good time."" he says.
- Hey, Garfield, don't eat the lasagna yet...
- It's still too hot. You're telling me?
-
-
-
-
-
- Don't eat me. You're too fat already!
- Who are you? This is your conscience speaking.
- I don't have a conscience. I know. I'm free-lancing. If you are my conscience, what are you doing in my food bowl? I took on a form you would understand.
- What do you really look like? Well, if you must know...
- I look like everyone's mother. Natch. Tell me, conscience, just what does a conscience do?
- It is my duty to make you feel bad about things that make you feel good.
- That's sad. It's a living. Well, conscience, if you don't mind, I'll go to bed now. Tah tah
- Look both ways before crossing the street.
- What's that supposed to mean? Sorry, it was just a knee-jerk nag. I can't believe my conscience is following me around. I must be cracking up.
- A little nap-nap should clear my head.
- You sleep too much. ACK Don't you think you should be getting up now?
- Look, conscience, get out of my life. I have no use for you. Careful, fella. or I'll call my big brother.
- Who's he? Guilt. On the jogging track in 5 minutes, sucker! Be there! Good morning, ham, good morning, eggs, good morning, milk.
- There's one nice thing about visiting the farm...
- The food is fresh.
- Here, lunch. Here, lunch.
- Uh-oh.
- This is not good.
- Garfield! Where have you been?! At Custer's last stand. I love it when the good humor man comes. DING DING
- I love it when I get a popsicle.
- I hate it when my lips stick to the *@!! popsicle. Ever notice how moths circle the light?
- Like planets orbiting a distant sun.
- I love it when I get philosophical. I wonder what happens when a moth gets too close to the light.
- AYIEEEE! FOOM!
- At least he didn't suffer. Let us examine a pet phenomenon called the ""rips"".
- That's when your pets race around the house for no apparent reason.
- Other than to mangle the family cat. You boys stop racing around.
- Garfield, slow down!
- Okay. Would you like to go for a walk, Odie?
- Let's see...I need a leash.
- You stay out of this.
- I love sacks.
- I wouldn't kid you, Parnelli. This honey will do 0-60 in 6 seconds flat.
- I swear, Sally, get your head out of the sand. The sack dress is coming back.
- I think I'll step into the root cellar and see what's for dinner.
- OH, NO!
- Hello, maintenance? Call the exterminator, my condo has dogs.
- Good morning, Garfield. It's me, Nermal. I'm young and good-looking and you're not.
- I didn't need that. Can I get you anything for breakfast, Garfield?
- Yeah, how about a big glass of freshly-squeezed kitten juice?
- You don't like me, don't you? How cute! Nermal brought me my newspaper!
- And my slippers and my pipe! What more could a man want?
- How about a woman? Let's get you into trouble, Nermal.
- Look in the cookie jar! Look in the cookie jar! No, you can't have a cookie, Garfield, You'll spoil dinner.
- Thanks for the cookies. Jeff would have known what Lassie was talking about.
- BLUT! BLUT!
- Call it cruel. Call it juvenile. I call it asserting myself. I hate to bother you, sir, but you put insufficient postage on your package.
- What package?
- This kitten you're sending to Abu Dhabi. GARFIELD Poor me.
- What a yucky evening.
- It's dark and rainy and there's nothing on television.
- I crave sunshine, daisy-filled meadows and good times. I need a ticket out of here.
- Wait a minute! I have one! SNAP!
- I wonder how fast I can run.
- I wonder what would happen if I hit this kitty door at Mach 2.
- I wonder if killing a mailman is a federal offense. I love attacking the mailman. Some days I scratch him. Some days I bite him. Some days I trip him.
- Today I'm trying something new. *
- I'm humiliating him. *
- ARRRGH! b-b-b-b
- When he comes around, he'll thank me for breaking up the monotony of his dreary job. Come on, mailman, deliver that mail.
- And when you do, I'm going to leap on you and all that will be left will be your mailbag and that silly-looking hat of yours.
- Has the mailman come yet, Garfield? No, he's still standing at the end of the sidewalk sobbing. SLAM!
- Rats! I missed him!
- Apparently, no one ever told him to look both ways before crossing the street. SCREECH Be a good boy and fetch the mail, Garfield. Oui, mon capitaine.
- RIP ROWT CLOBBER BLAP
- Did you hurt him bad? Oh, just a few lacerations, abrasions and internal injuries. I was in a good mood. plop!
-
- GLUP!
- ptoo ptoo
- SPLUT!
- Salvage the pride, Garfield, salvage the pride. Hey, Garfield, it says here people can perform superhuman feats of strength during periods of great stress.
- What baloney!
- By the way, I'm taking you to the vet today. You can't hide from forever, Garfield. I'm going to find you and take you to the vet.
- You may be sneaky, but I'm sneakier.
- ""Sneaky"" is my middle name. Garfield can't resist lasagna, and when he comes to eat it, I'm going to catch him and take him to the vet.
- SMACK GULP SLURP
- That cat has the longest lips I've ever seen. Now where could Garfield be?
- He's not in tie cookies, and he certainly won't be in the doggie biscuits.
- POO! It's a good thing I can't read. Aha! There you are, Garfield! You're going to the vet now.
-
- Sorry, Odie. SMACK I wish I could find Garfield's hiding place so I could take him to the vet.
- He's sure hiding in a good place.
- A good place-
- Not a smart place-
- But a good place. I can't believe my luck. This is too perfect.
- I will now slide down this banister and make a four-point landing on Odie down there.
- BANZAI!
-
- RATS!
- I can see the headline now: ""Twist in plot fatal to local cat"". Wouldn't it be great if everything could talk?
- I'd get out of bed and the wall would say, ""Good morning, Jon."" and the sink would say, ""Good morning, Jon."" That wouldn't be so hot.
- Every time a light bulb burned out, it would be like a death in the family. If people had hair all over their bodies, would they wear clothing?
-
- Probably not. What would happen if people were cats and cats were people?
- That's an easy one.
- Dogs would soon be extinct. I was wondering, Garfield...
- What if being fat were considered attractive?
- What do you mean, ""what if,"" bozo? I wonder what life would be like if we never had to eat.
- That would take some getting used to.
- For a time, mothers would fix their families three square nothings a day. What if there were never a Leonardo da Vinci?
- That would be awful!
- The da Vinci kids would have been orphans. RING!
- BRING! SMASH!
- DING DING DING DING
- STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- GASP! COUGH WHEEzeeee
- SHOOP!
- Rats! Too late! Now I'm wide awake. I hate mondays.
- This is your conscience speaking. It's not nice to hate mondays. Look at it as starting a fresh week with a clean slate.
- I hate mondays. This is your conscience speaking. Don't you dare push Odie off the table! That would be inhumane and cruel.
- Then YOU push him off. POKE!
- That was kind of fun. Why do you follow me around, conscience? If I don't you won't be very nice.
- If I put this cork in your bottle would you be trapped? Yes, but that wouldn't be very nice.
- That wasn't very nice. Now that my conscience is trapped in this bottle, I can walk away and enjoy myself.
- That's okay, go ahead, have fun, don't worry about me. I'll just sit here in the dark...all alone.
- You're very good. One of the best. Let's have some fun, Garfield. Take one step back. Okay.
-
- I thought consciences were supposed to be nice! I'm on break. I have my conscience trapped in this bottle. I'll just set it by Jon.
-
- Get a haircut. tappity tappity tappity
- Good evening, ladies and germs. In our audience tonight is a boy scout delegation from Booga-Booga. Welcome, guys.
- I'm dedicating my first song to you. Appropriately enough it's called, ""I'm just a boy scouting for the key to your heart"".
- HEY!
- All right, you Booga-Booga boobs!
- If you're going to throw anything, throw money, okay? ...okay.
- CLOBBER
- Silly me, I forgot the only currency in Booga-Booga is 800-pound chariot wheels. What a glorious morning!
- I could really enjoy a morning like this.
- If I could only get this catch out of my back. I gotta get help for this catch in my back.
- Hey, guys.
- What we have here is a failure to communicate. Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get rid of this catch in my back.
-
- Maybe not. I hate having a catch in my back. I get no sleep, I get no food, I get no exercise.
-
- Don't tip the cat over, Odie. I get no respect. Well hello there, Mr. Stuck-Up.
- Having a catch in one's back does tend to give one an air of sophistication...
- I could get to like this. Let's take care of that catch in your back, Garfield.
- CRINK!
- There you go, old buddy. Thanks, I think. Hey, look! Odie!
- It snowed last night!
- Ha ha, so you boys want to play in the snow, huh?
- First you'll have to wear your nice, warm pet sweaters.
- And your wool caps and mittens and mufflers and booties.
- There you go, boys.
- Having fun yet? Ha ha ha, wheee. Who's that painting at my door?
- HONK HONK
- Oh, good morning, Odie. HONK YAWN
- GASP!
- Waking up to my own bad breath is bad enough, but someone else's is unbearable. I am proud to be a pet. Pets lend a touch of elegance to a home. SLUP SLUP
-
- I am proud to be a cat. SLUP SLUP Okay, get revved up there, Odie.
- GO!
- I love toys that don't need batteries.
- crinkle
- May I have some of that candy bar? Here, take it.
- I declare this steak the sovereign property of Garfield, the cat!
- I've never had my dinner annexed before. And you may never see it alive again.
- SMACK Let's play!
- Leave me alone, Garfield. Let's play! Let's play!
- Oh, okay, we'll play.
- TICKLE! TICKLE! TICKLE! TICKLE! HA! HA! HEE! HO! HEE! HEE!
- OUCH!
- I'm through playing now. Hey, Garfield, we're going to the farm to visit dad and mom this week.
- Goodo. I need a change of surroundings. I was getting bored with this city life.
- It will be nice to be bored in the country for a change. It's great to be back on the farm, Garfield. Nothing ever changes.
- The same old surroundings, the same old room...
- The same old chores. The same old manure. This pastoral scene is not exactly intellectually stimulating.
- Read any good books lately? Oink.
- ""Oink,"" he says. I rest my case. ""Oink"" in the existential sense, of course. Doc, do you ever regret that you stayed on the farm while I went to the city to live in the lap of luxury?
- Not really. Dad will probably will the farm to me, and I'll sell the acreage at a huge profit and retire while young.
- Need a hired hand? Give me a resume and three good references. And mom doesn't count. Beautiful sunset, isn't it, dad? Purtyer than a little red wagon goin' up a hill.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, it's just something you city boys expect us farmers to say. How true. Garfield and I must be leaving now, mom. Stay, stay! I just baked some pies.
- We gotta go. Come on, Garfield.
- Say what, stranger? WHEW!
- Today I am going to cure Garfield of his gluttony.
- Go to it, boy!
- He's either going to get sick eating all that food, or he's going to burst trying. MUNCH SMACK SLURP
- Are you going to want the rest of that hamburger? AWK!
- I love chasing birds.
- Except when they do that. BONK! Rats!
- Double rats!
- And, of course, tripe rats. Shoo!
- Flies and I have a lot in common...
- You can't keep either of us away from food. I gotta beat that fly to my food!
- I WIN!
- You lose, fella. POO
- WHEW
- BOO! *
- REARRR!
- It's the old ""bring in the reinforcements"" trick.
-
- All right, you guys! Outside!
-
-
- Where were you guys raised, in a barn? Next time use the door.
- CRASH! Thank you. GARFIELD! I CAN'T STRAIGHTEN UP!
- ZIP
- Ha, ha, my tie was caught in my zipper. Help me. Gimme those cookies.
- HIYA! HUT! KONK! PUNT!
- I'd turn her in, but who'd admit to being mangled by a girl scout? Rise and shine, Garfield!
- Garfield?
- clunk clunk Time to wash my blankey, what say? Be a good boy and fetch the morning paper, Garfield.
- Yes, master. I am your beck and call, master.
- Why can't I have a normal house cat like everyone else? I need a brain for my master.
-
- A brain, I need a brain for my master. Ah, coffee.
-
- Being a hunchback is going to take some getting used to. This is it, boys.
- Tonight we find out who the phantom ripper is.
- He's stepping out the shadows now.
- Oh, no! It's...it's you! AYIEEE!
- Good movie. click
- Who was he?
- We thought YOU were watching. SMACK GRRRRR It's Monday out there. I feel it in the air. I hate mondays.
- I'm sure the world will end on a Monday...at least I hope it does.
- It would be a shame to end the world right before a weekend. Pooky, where are you? Oh, no! My teddy bear is missing.
- This has the makings of a classic mystery. I already have some prime suspects.
- It's easy when you live with a rogue's gallery. I suspect Odie of kidnapping Pooky. Watch him crumble under my keen questioning.
- Where were you on the evening of April 1?!
- What am I doing? Odie doesn't even know where he is now. There must be clue to Pooky's disappearance here somewhere...
- Aha! could this be a telltale trail of teddy bear hair?
- Even if it isn't, that was a pretty nifty bit of alliteration. Hello, what's this? Just as my teddy bear disappears, this sack mysteriously appears...
- Something smells fishy here.
- Aha! Jon! It was you who kidnapped Pooky!
- Obviously, sensing I was hot on his trail and fearing my wrath, he's decided to return Pooky and throw himself on the mercy of the court.
- I had your teddy bear cleaned, Garfield. Sigh...thank you.
-
- * AROOOOOOO *
- tappity tappity clap clap clap
- I like you, Garfield.
- And I like myself, Arlene. I can take a hint.
- Like myself when I'm with you that is. It's nearly midnight on a Monday.
- I can't believe it! Nothing bad has happened to me all day.
- COO-COO! Watch this. It's the old rubber bone gag.
- SHOOP!
- Practical jokes are wasted on the stupid. SQUIT
- BLAT
- Unnnngh! Help! Help! The alien is sucking my brain dry! Garfield has raised playing with food to an art form Garfield, I think it's time we grow up, be more responsible, take a more mature outlook on life... Hee hee
- I don't think you're taking me seriously! I'm sorry.
- I don't know what came over me. Stop begging, Garfield. You may have any food that falls on the floor.
-
- I hate you. I can live with that. Hee-hee, snort.
- WAH-HA-HA!
- Okay! Okay! I'm awake! Look out, world.
- I feel invincible today.
- FOOD! I CRAVE FOOD!
- That took nearly three seconds, Jon. We'll do better next time, won't we?
- I shall take my morning stroll mow. Be a good boy and alert the media.
- Hold up, traffic. Here comes Garfield. Where were you? Learning that some things can't be intimidated.
-
- I'm sorry. Did I bring you down, old buddy? Like a rock, old buddy. I'm bored, Garfield.
- I'm tired of seeing the same old scenery. Do you know what I mean? Not really.
- At least you get to see the scenery. Garfield, there's only one way to shed this shroud of gray we wear...
- There's only one path out of this valley of gloom. There's only one sure bet to beat the boreds.
- Gather your things. We're going to vacation! I'm packed. Let's go! How much are the plane tickets? ...uh, do you have anything cheaper?
- That could be fatal!
- I don't think they want out business, Garfield. Where's the competition for the low rollers these days? Thank you very much.
- Garfield, I had to book our vacation all third-class. I hope you don't mind. That's okay.
- It's still better than this fourth-class existence at home. Let's blow this joint, Garfield.
- Hang on!
- Where did you go? To give the refrigerator a goodbye kiss. Thank heavens for these reduced airline rates, Garfield. No frills, no food, no class.
- Welcome to Inversion Layer Airlines, sir. In what section are you traveling? Uh...third class.
- What section, sir? Third class.
- I can't hear you! THIRD CLASS!
- In the back with the rest of the slime, you vermin!
- Why can't I get any respect, Garfield? In this game, you must BUY respect, my friend. I haven't seen a stewardess in hours, Garfield.
- I'm going to find out what's going on around here.
- Excuse me sir. How's the service on this airline? Hey! We're getting hungry here in third-class! What's to eat?!
- BLAT! BLAT!
- Hardtack and swill. Yum-yum. CONK! CONK! Nyah! Nyah! Nyah! Nyah!
- Mikey, it's not nice to make fun of people, even though they ARE traveling in third-class.
- NO! GARFIELD, NO! LET ME HURT 'EM JUST A LITTLE BIT!
- I know this is just the third-class exit from the plane, Garfield...
- But you'd think they'd give us a ladder or something. I would like your cheapest room for me and my cat. Yes, sir. That would be the Jack Benny suite, sir.
- Well, Garfield, there's the bed and the bathroom's down the hall. Any questions? Yes...
- Where are YOU going to sleep? All I have to do is unpack, Garfield, and we'll be ready for some rest and relaxation.
- ARRRRGH! NOT ANOTHER PET TO TAKE CARE OF!
- I don't think I can take any more surprises. Then don't look at what Odie did to your sport jacket.
- You guys have a good time, but no digging in the sand, if you know what I mean?
- Hey, baby! What's your sign?
- Careful, buddy. She's MY girl.
- Aw, go pound sand, you little twerp
-
- Well...I guess we are to do as he says, not as he does. Hey, Garfield! Are you ready to go play golf?
-
- Aren't you coming? On second thought, I think I'd rather stay in the room and watch the sink back-up ODIE! GET AWAY FROM THAT TREE! GARFIELD! GET OUT OF THAT SAND TRAP!
- Would you mind observing proper golf etiquette there, mister?
- I'm sorry, but my pets are driving me nuts. It's the outfit I'm talking about. CRACK!
- Oh, no! I hit an old lady in the head and knocked her out cold!
- What should I do, Garfield? I'd straighten that left arm and turn that right hand over more.
- ROWR!
- GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THAT SAND TRAP? Squatting on a sandburg, thank you. Well, boys, it's been a nice vacation, but it's time to head home.
- Good heavens! What happened to you guys?!
- Odie discovered how to dial room service. Burp. Here we are! Home sweet home!
- ARRRGH!
- OKAY; WHO LEFT THE FAUCET RUNNING?! I didn't want my sponge collection to dry out.
- MY BED! ODIE'S SLEEPING IN MY BED!
- This calls for a good stomping!
- STOMP STOMP STOMP
-
-
- So much for my french bread and olive collection. Some people wonder why I hate mondays.
- Maybe I'm fatalistic.
- But I suspect I'm just stupid. scratch scratch scratch
- WHAM!
- I'm not very fond of Tuesday, either. I am absolutely not getting out of bed today.
- Hey, Garfield. There's a spider on your blanket.
- I keep forgetting we live in a generation without absolutes. I'll teach him to be a spider! STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP
- He won't have the guts to do that again.
- STOMP STOMP Better safe than sorry. STOMP STOMP STOMP Look at this.
- A cat stroking his owner!
- Why so affectionate, Garfield? I just squashed a spider.
- SLUG
- Big day.
- Fetch the stick, Odie!
-
-
- I'm lonely. I think I'll see if I can find Arlene.
- Hi there. You two-timing swine!
- What happened? Hi, Arlene. DON'T SPEAK TO ME, YOU CAD, I SAW YOU WITH THAT OTHER WOMAN!
- Oh come on now, do I look like the kind of guy who could easily attract women? I suppose you're right. And just what do you mean by that? Here is your dinner, my dear. BLAT
- Is this food fresh? Ha ha ha, why of course!
- This is only yesterday's newspaper. Aren't you going to join me for dinner, Garfield? Uh...no thank you. I'm on a diet.
- A diet?! How long have you been on a diet?
- Oh, for about 18 seconds now. Ho hum...
- Why do we see each other? It beats being lonely.
- I was hoping for something more romantic. That's way down the list.
- Is our date over? Did it begin?
- Some women don't appreciate us strong, silent types. tappity tappity tappity
- Good evening, folks. Here's a joke...what did the beaver say when he heard the chain saw?
- CHUKONG!
- Chirp Chirp They're playing my song.
- All of your mothers wear army boots.
- KONG CRASH! BAP!
- Why do you do it, Garfield? I loooove the attention. I hate Monday. That's the day people go back to work, kids go back to school...
-
- And diets begin. Garfield, you're too fat. I can't help it.
- I have a slow metabolism.
- A reeeeeeal slow metabolism. Do you know what I hate about diets?
- Eating is social.
- But when you diet, you diet alone. I think I have a way out of this diet.
- I know I'm too fat for a cat...
- But, I'm just right for a bumblebee! How goes the diet, Garfield?
- ROAR
- What was that?! That was my stomach, you twit.
- AYIEEEEE!
- Everyone's a critic. cough weeze *
- Oh no!
- I've tangle wit that dog before.
- If I take my eyes off him, he'll clobber me!
- I can't stand it.
- WHONGO!
- Why did you do that? I hit him back first. I hate mondays. Garfield, I don't know why you hate mondays so much.
- BLAT!
- SEE?!!! Good morning, Garfield.
- I made your coffee just like you like it.
- Strong. Oh shucks, I just spilled the only cup of coffee we have in the house.
-
- * ROWR *
- WHOCK!
- Garfield, where did the flowers come from? Well, why don't we just read the note? You like to scratch things, don't you, Garfield? Does a chicken like to peck? Sure I do!
- Good! Scratch my back.
- NO CLAWS! NO CLAWS! If I didn't use claws, I wouldn't be scratching, now would I? Scratch higher, Garfield.
- Higher!
- Get off the curtains, Garfield. I was just following instructions. grrrr
- RRRRRR Jon's best shoes!
- Sometimes Odie makes me so angry, I could just scream.
-
-
-
- ARRRRRGH! Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, uncle Roy.
- I love you just the way you are. I love you too, uncle Roy.
- I also love mondays. Stick it in your ear, uncle Roy. Good morning, boys and girls. I love you just the way you are. Everybody loves uncle Roy.
- You are kind, thoughtful, obedient and considerate.
- Not to mention intelligent, witty and charming. We all know uncle Roy is a liar, but we don't care. Here we are in a real factory, boys and girls. Let's see what we can learn...
- ARRRRRGH! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP!
- SHUT THIS **!* THING OFF. Uncle Roy is learning never to wear loose clothing around big machinery. Good morning, boys and girls. You are probably wondering where my dog, Bob, is this morning.
- Wellll...it seems old Bob bit Mr. Blue Jeans the mailman once too often...
- So Bob has decided to move to a local research facility to pursue a career as a laboratory animal. And I'm Frank Sinatra. Let's play pretend, boys and girls. Let's pretend it's contract negotiation time for uncle Roy...
- And there are big green monsters who want to take uncle Roy off the air...
- And the only thing that can save uncle Roy are letters saying how much you love uncle Roy. I hate to see a grown man grovel. Looks who's come to visit, boys and girls. It's Jerry the Cat. Hi, Jerry. Hi, uncle Roy.
- How are you? I'm fine, How are you? Uncle Roy is getting pretty bizarre.
- How's your mother? She's fine. Who'd be dumb enough to believe there is a talking cat? Hey, Jon, Look at this!
- Hey, Jon. Watch me!
- Jon doesn't pay any attention to me anymore. Watch this.
- Hey, Jon!
- Hey, Jon!
- Hey, Garfield? What, Jon?
- I don't pay any attention to me anymore.
-
- Don't you dare. I don't know what you're talking about. Every morning for nearly six years now, I fix raisin toast for Garfield.
- He loves his raisin toast.
- What's in the drawer? A six-year supply of raisins. * crack
- OH, YUK!
- It's not often you see a yolk with a beak. How would you like your bacon prepared, Garfield? Let's shoot for recognizable.
- Jon is a terrible cook. He could ruin cereal.
- Bacon flambe, yum yum. An interesting thing about food...
- One minute it may be haute cuisine.
- But the instant you put it into the sink, it becomes garbage. Here's your cereal, Garfield.
- What's the matter? Aren't you hungry? Not really.
- I think one of the flakes just moved.
- I'm going to kick Odie off this table.
- And he'll probably sprain something and have to go to the vet.
- And I'll get lonely without him.
- And Jon will be angry without me.
- And the humane society will want to lynch me.
- But nobody said life was a rose garden. I can't believe I turn six years old tomorrow. Some cats say, ""Life begins at six,"" but I don't buy that.
- Old age may take its toll on some cats, but it's not going to happen to me! I'm going to do something about it!
- Right after my nap. Happy birthday, Garfield! I got you a rubber chicken. They're lots of fun! We'll see about that.
- SMACK SPLUT
- Chicken, you and I are going to have some good times. You need a name, fella. Let's see...what do you name a rubber chicken?
- rrrrr
- ""Stretch""! peck peck peck
- SMACK!
- I'll have some ham and eggs, and my friend, Stretch, will have a bowl of rubber bands. peck peck peck
- STOP PECKING ME WITH THAT RUBBER CHICKEN!
- Aw, look, you just hurt Stretch's feelings. He brings out the worst in me. Pooky, I would like you to meet Stretch, my rubber chicken.
- Quite frankly, Pooky and Stretch don't have a lot of personality.
- But you have to trade off something when you surround yourself with good listeners.
- YAWN It's bed-bye time again.
- Tonight I think I'll take a deep breath, slowly close my eyes and savor the heavy feeling of sleep gradually overtaking my body. PAT! PAT! PAT!
- Then again it would be fun to have a cup of coffee and toss and turn for a couple of hours, then sleep till noon.
- Or maybe I'll run around the block, collapse into bed exhausted and fall asleep instantly.
- Or I could watch the all-night movies on TV until my eyelids get so heavy I couldn't possibly hold them open any longer.
- Sigh...so much sleeping to do and so few nights. Garfield, I think you're too mean to Odie.
- I never want to see you hit him again. Oh, very well.
- KONK! I'm going to the store, Garfield. If you lay a paw on Odie, I'll spank you.
-
- BOING Garfield, I swear you've done everything to Odie a cat could do to a dog. Au contraire.
- PLINK
- Never underestimate me. Hey, Odie! I found your nose!
- Let me put it on for you, pal. squik squik
- Very nice. I like you as a rat terrier. Well, well, well. I see you're eating my food, Odie. Now what are going to do with you?
- We are going to kick you into next week! That's what we're going to do! PUNT
- Where's Odie? Somewhere over saturday. Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food.
- I guess I 'll just have to make do.
- BLUT
- I believe you're gaining weight, Garfield. I believe your eyeballs are shrinking.
- Look at that soft belly. That's just water retention.
- Now why do you suppose you're looking larger? An optical illusion?
- The older you get', the bigger you get. Bigger-boned maybe.
- You're fat, Garfield. I am not fat!
- My center of gravity is just getting lower. I have this nagging feeling I'm forgetting something.
- WHUMP!
- Oh yes, I forgot I kicked Odie into next week, last week. Pooky loves me, I can tell.
- He doesn't talk, he doesn't walk, he doesn't think.
- a little nothing goes a long way. I'm working up a routine for the fence tonight, Pooky. Tell me what you think of it.
- I knew a teddy bear who was so ugly, even the tide wouldn't take it out.
- BLAT! Good evening, ladies and germs. I'd like you to meet Pooky, my gag writer.
- SPLAT
- Welcome to the show biz, kid. Jump through the hoop, Pooky.
- Hey, Garfield, what's happening? I'm pretending to teach Pooky tricks.
- Butterflies are versatile. They can caress the air.
- They can kiss the dew from the flowers.
- And they can embed themselves in radiators. FWAP! scritch scritch
- I'll be darned. These labels are loose.
- *
- It's the old ""Cats get the tuna while the owner get the cat food"" gag.
-
- Surprise, Garfield! I fixed us a tuna noodle casserole.
- Oh, well, I guess a half a surprise is better than none at all. Garfield, I know you hate mondays.
- But everything that could possibly happen to you has already happened.
- Au contraire, power failure breath. Since we can't watch TV during a power failure, Garfield, what say we listen to the radio?
- Ha ha! Do I feel stupid. That's because you ARE stupid. CLICK CLICK
- How about a game of cards? No, thanks. I'm just going to sit here and cry for a while. I've learned something from this power failure, Garfield.
- When you are deprived of your eyesight, isn't it amazing how much keener your other senses become?
- Huh? Don't worry, Garfield. The power failure may have spoiled the food in the refrigerator...
- But we still have lots of canned goods.
- Now where's our electric opener? ARRRGH! Hey, Garfield, as long as the power is off, we might as well go out.
- I have my bowling ball. Let's go bowling.
- Get your fingers out of my eyes and your thumb out of my mouth, and I'll consider it.
- Great! The power's back on! I can't think of anything worse than a power failure.
- How about two power failures? Z Z
- BABOOM!
- SHOOP ZOOM
- Allright you guys, get out of here. It's only a little thunderstorm.
- Pets...they're just like kids.
- CRACK KABOOM!
- Urf! Give me some room, will you? Hey! Your feet are cold! And now, a word from our sponsor.
- Hey, America. Here's a cat food we bet your cat will love.
- You're on. Good morning, old buddy.
- ARRRGH! That's only a piece of lint, Garfield.
- It sure does a great spider impression. BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Odie isn't really stupid. BONK
- He's just chased one too many parked cars. Okay, you turkeys, I'm prepared for anything.
- * AROOO *
- CRASH! Garfield, if you mess with my new fish, you'll regret it.
- What's so regrettable about a little seafood snack?
- Jon's going to pay for this.
- Well, well, Odie. I see you derive great pleasure from other's misfortune.
- So do I! SNAP!
- Garfield, where are yoooooou?
- Get out of the breadbox, Garfield!
- Get out from under the chair, Garfield!
- Garfield, you know I hate it when you hide from me!
- Oh, well. I'll find him sooner or later. There's only so many places a fat slob like him can hide.
- Get out of the bookcase, Garfield. You sleep too much, Garfield.
- Sometimes I do feel bad about sleeping so much.
- What with all the insomniacs in China. What Odie needs is a good kick.
- Uh-oh! Nap attack!
- I don't even want to know. Z Z
- Z SNORT! SNORT! Z Z
- Z Whimper
- No, Odie, Garfield isn't dead. He's just a hardcore sleeper. Are you going to sleep all day, Garfield? Let me check my social calendar.
- Let's see...there's high tea with the Queen of England tomorrow, but nothing today.
- Z Ask a stupid question... YAWN What a great night's sleep!
- I'm ready to attack a fresh new day.
- Good evening, Garfield. What's on the late movie? Good morning, Garfield. I'm hungry.
- How would you like your egg prepared? I would like it hatched.
- Raise it to young chickenhood on a diet of cracked corn, barley and sorghum molasses.
- Then barbecue the dude. I should think a steak sauce and honey glaze would be nice.
-
- Scrambled? Scrambled. There's only one way to beat the heat today.
- Where are you going, Garfield? To the beach.
- Hello, beach. There's only one thing I hate about the beach.
- PONK!
- It's always so crowded. GREAT!
-
- Surf's up! Garfield, I know you like to have fun...
- But you look ridiculous.
- Stand aside there, fella. Here comes my next wave. Okay, everyone out of the pool! I'm going swimming.
- You! the one with the whistle-out!
- I don't need a lifeguard. *
- Rats.
- I thought you were going swimming. The water was polluted. Hello, what have we here?
- I think I'll draw something.
- Hey, Garfield! This is a great drawing! Do you know what his means?!
- A cat who can draw! We'll make millions. You'll be famous!
- We'll tour the world! Live out a suitcase! You'll do thousands of drawings!
- SLASH!
- Why did you do that? Suddenly, life got too complicated. NO! NO! NO! DON'T MAKE ME DO IT!
- ARRRGH! SOMEONE HELP ME!
- Sometimes it's hard to fight primal instincts. Hello, lunch.
-
- Those bird's nets are deceptively large. Why do I do it? Why do I climb up trees when I can't climb down?
- The neighborhood always turns out to see me. Then the fire department comes to get me. Then my picture ends up in the newspaper.
- I just answered my own question. Oh good! Here comes a fireman to save me!
- Terrific. Why do I always get the fat ones?
- And the ones who are sensitive about their weight? I'm getting sleepy.
- If birds can sleep in trees, so can I.
- Z If I truly believe I'm a bird, I might be able to flap my arms and fly out of this tree.
- I'm a bird! I'm a bird!
- I hope birds' bones knit quickly. Ballet slippers? Uh-oh, Jon's getting weird on me.
- See the ballet slippers I'm giving my niece, Garfield? I wish I had ballet slippers.
- I'll let this niece has never been on pointe.
- Or done a jete.
- Or a pirouette.
- POW!
- What happened? I had a ballet slipper blow out on a bourree.
- WHAP!
- Sometime, somewhere, when you are least expecting it...Monday strikes. What's wrong with this picture?
- There's no food in your bowl, Garfield. Give the man a cigar! Fill it up, turkey.
- I hate it when lower life forms are condescending to me. I've been taken! There was only one kernel of popcorn in this whole bag.
- Oh, well, one's better than nothing.
- POP! Good morning, fern. How about a drink of water, little friend?
- How nice, Garfield, I'm glad to see you take an interest in my fern.
- I'm fattening it for slaughter. Where is it written that humans must give cats milk in saucers?! Why not in cups or bowls or pans?
- SPLASH
- SEE?! I think Garfield is trying to tell me something. What is it, Garfield?
- Pick me up. Too fat to hop on the table, huh?
- One of these days, I'll learn.
-
- SCRIK
- SLUCK
- SHLONK
- TUCK
- I love rubber pets. I'm bored, bored, bored. I need something to spice up my week.
- THAT'S IT.
- The caped avenger returns. Uh-oh.
- RUN FOR COVER, ODIE!
- Make way for the caped avenger.
- Garfield is fantasizing again. The caped avenger seeks out evil wherever it may lurk.
-
- As long as it isn't in dark scary places. The caped avenger will now descend upon an old archenemy.
- BLAT!
- The caped avenger forgot to correct for crosswind. Be careful, mere mortal man! That food may be poisoned! The caped avenger will taste it for you.
-
- It's okay. (burp) Enjoy. The caped avenger pauses to wash his cape.
-
- The hankied avenger plods on. Hmmm.
- This ladder gives me a great idea.
- I'm going to glue my feet to the ceiling.
- And blow Jon's mind.
- This is going to be fun.
- Unless, of course, Jon doesn't see me.
- Unless, of course, Jon goes to bed. Guess what, Garfield! We're going to the farm this week.
- Whoopty-doo. Going to the farm is like going to the zoo...
- Where they eat everything but th cats. Dad! Mom!
- Jon Boy! Jonny!
- I wish they'd call me by my real name. You're right, dummy. Doc Boy! Don't call me Doc Boy!
- What's with him, dad? Ever since he started wearing long pants, he's hated the be called ""Boy"".
- How long has that been? Since last thursday. A late bloomer. I know we're brothers, Doc Boy, but do you think we've grown apart since I moved to the city? Don't call me Doc Boy.
- How would you like it if I called you a city slicker? I wouldn't like that.
- DOC BOY! DOC BOY! DOC BOY! SLICKER! SLICKER! SLICKER! Boys! Boys! Boys! Well, Garfield, this week you learned where bacon comes from. Bacon comes from a pig.
- And you learned where milk comes from. Milk comes from the udder of a cow.
- Would you like to know where eggs come from? I would as soon that remain a mystery. Do you know what worries me, Garfield?
- My grandfather was bald, my dad is bald and my brother is balding. Not to worry.
- You are probably adopted. Garfield, when we get to the campsite, what's the first thing you'd like to do? Go home.
- Here we are, boys. We're camping miles from nowhere. I'd say we're closer than that.
- CLICK
- Oh no! Odie locked himself in the car! The poor little guy could suffocate! I think I'm starting to enjoy camping.
- Unlock the door, boy. Unlock the door. Breathe deeply, boy.
- Something just occurred to me. Could it be...? Could it be, Odie isn't as stupid as he looks? Pwoooock, pwock, pwock, pwock.
-
- Don't look, Stretch! It's not a pretty sight! Pwoooock, pwock, pwock, pwock.
- PUKUCK! PUKUCK! PUKUCK!
- My rubber friend, Stretch, objects to your cannibalistic ways. I'd like to have just one meal in peace. Garfield, do you know how silly you look carrying that stupid rubber chicken around all the time?
- FFFFF
- Uh-oh, fella. Now you did it. You made Stretch mad. Are you in there, Garfield?
- There ain't nobody here but us chickens.
- I WILL NOT SPEAK TO YOUR RUBBER CHICKEN! Think of Stretch as my social secretary. Here, Stretch, have an apple.
-
- STOMP! POO! DONG! Okay, guys, get on your mark, get st, go!
-
- Competition is apparently not a driving force in their lives. Hello, I'm Nermal, the... ""The world's cutest kitten."" I know, I know.
- Why, hello, Nermal. Aren't you cute.
- I want some attention, too. BONK
- Aw, poor little guy!
- Well, two can play the sympathy game.
- CRASH!
- That was one of my best plates. That was one of my best heads. I love your purr, Garfield. Purrr
- I wish there were a way to get the purr without the cat. Purrr
- But I guess you have to take the bad with the good. You're treading on thin ice, fella. Ready for a gourmet meal, Garfield?
- WHAM!
- I hate spiders. One nice thing about confiding in pets is that they are non-judgmental.
- Garfield, I got a speeding ticket today.
- SMACK! That was a stupid thing to do.
- Why, thank you, Garfield!
- PSHHH Hee, hee, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
- WHIRRRRR! How prophetic. Rats, Garfield fell asleep in the middle of the door.
- Have you ever tried to pick up a sleeping cat?
- It's impossible. *
- Good morning, Garfield. Good morning, Jon. My rubber chicken, Stretch, needs a bath too.
- SPLOOSH!
- Sign here for this package, mister.
- PAPER! BONK
- HEY, WORLD! I'M TAKING A BATH! COME ON IN AND WATCH! I'll be right back. I'm sure the man's joking, Reba.
-
- It's diet time, Garfield. I was afraid of that. In order to properly diet, you must change your eating habits, Garfield.
- You must look at food differently.
- Ha ha ha, Garfield. Let's measure your tummy, Garfield.
- When you take four inches of your waist, you may go off your diet.
- And that doesn't count. You may have coffee on your diet, Garfield.
- Thank goodness.
- This diet isn't going to be as bad as I thought. For once in my life, a diet worked.
- I'm going to treat myself to a potato chip.
- poomp! Rats.
- Let's see how I did on my diet this week. Whimper. Oh, shut up. Good morning, sunshine, poke poke poke
- Hey, Garfield, what's all this junk in your bed?
- This isn't junk, this is my stuff.
- I use this brass lizard to scratch my back.
- And here is some extra cat hair for your food, and a double corncob that is a family heirloom.
- And this is my bean-filled whack-bonk. What does that do?
- WHACK! BONK It's Monday morning. A cold. gray, dizzy Monday morning.
- Some dude with a trumpet is wailin' some blues on the radio and my breakfast is cold. * *
- It's all so perfectly depressing I can't wipe this smile off my face. * Hold it right there. I always want to remember you like this.
- As the kind, benevolent provider.
- Trying to poison me with that cat food! munch smack slurp
- Uh-oh!
- Quickfood.
- BARK! BLUT!
- Twenty years from now I'm going to look back on this and LAAAAAAUGH. rowr fffft!! What are you doing with your teddy bear, Garfield?
- Pooky and I are having lunch. We do everything together. I swear.
- You cats have the strangest habits. Oh, come on, Garfield. The cat food isn't that bad.
- Then let's see how YOU like it!
- mmm good. YOU LIE!
-
-
-
-
-
- I thought fat people were jolly. Look at all those poor saps trudging to work on a Monday morning.
- Ha ha ha, you poor saps, you have to go to work and I don't 'cause I'm a cat!
- If I weren't me, I wouldn't like me very much. It's a real rat race out there.
- Everybody striving to get ahead.
- I think I'll go take a nap and fall off the pace.
- SUCK
- He's so lazy, I could just cry. Burp I got you something special, Garfield.
- It's too light for food, and you can't wrap sleep.
- It can't be THAT special. Good night, Garfield.
- *CLICK* Don't let the thing in the closet get you.
- Don't do that to me! I think I'll try a two-and-a-half nap attack in the pike position with a half twist.
-
- I'll settle for a belly-flop. Z
-
-
-
- HEY, HUBERT! REBA! COME HERE, QUICK!
- Play cowboy and horsy, boys. Do a handstand, Garfield. Balance on Garfield, Odie. Sad. He should get out of the house more. This feels like a great day to spend in bed.
- Hop up, Garfield. We're gooing on a picnic! Give the bugs and snakes my regrets. I ain't going.
- I'll get you for this, Monday! What's this? I packed the microwave for our picnic.
- Well, I'm leaving it here.
- WHA...! If the television stays, I stay. Wait 'til you taste my cherry pie, Garfield. It's the world's best.
- I agree.
- 22 million ants can't all be wrong. The picnic's all set, Garfield.
- Did I forget anything?
- You forgot the brick for the tablecloth. That pesky wind won't spoil our picnic now, Garfield.
- Where's the mustard?
- Under the third rock from the left. Well, Garfield, the ants ate my cherry pie. The wind blew the food everywhere. DON'T SAY IT! DON'T SAY IT!
- What else could possibly go wrong?
- You said it! MUNCH SLURP SMACK GULP
- Burp. Oh, boy, I ate too much pizza. Z
- SHUFFLE SHUFFLE SHUFFLE
- Who are you guys? We are your pizza nightmare.
- I'm the pepperoni, and these here are the onions and the anchovies.
-
- And who are you? I'm the matto ball you ate three weeks ago. Good morning, folks! My oh my, it's a beautiful Monday morning out there.
- Our weather radar shows clear skies with no rain in sight.
- Except over one house in the suburbs. Our satellite picture shows clouds over the northeast, sunny skies in the southwest...
- Traffic backed up on 12th street...
- And my little niece, Sally, playing in her sandbox i Texas. Kind of scary, isn't it? Wuth.
- You can always tell when Odie has been eating out of the refrigerator.
- He gets his tongue stuck in the ice cube trax. Wuth. GULP MUNCH SLURP
- Why do you eat so much, Garfield?
- In a former life I was a sanitary landfill. Clouds are so interesting. I love to find shapes in them.
- There's a chicken cloud, and a hamburger cloud, and a bicycle cloud.
- And I do believe that one's a rain cloud. What do you think of my new frame, Garfield?
- ARRRGH!
- Thank heavens! For a moment I thought it was a mirror.
-
- PUCUCK!
- ONE MORE STUNT LIKE THAT AND I'M GOING TO WRING YOUR RUBBER CHICKEN'S NECK!
-
- I'm sorry I snapped at you, Garfield? Will you forgive me? I forgive you.
- SMACK! WHAP! But Stretch doesn't! Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me.
- Hey, Arlene, what's my most outstanding feature? You're fat.
- Did you hear that? She admires me for my body. Do you love me more than you love food, Garfield?
- Do chickens have lips?
- No. Bingo. Aren't you ashamed of that space between your teeth? Of course not!
- It's a sign of sensitivity.
- I'd be sensitive about it too. I don't know what I see in him. Don't you just love sunrise, Garfield? The chirping of the birds...the crisp morning air.
- The sound of bacon sizzling in the skillet...the smell of fresh brewed coffee.
- I get the feeling we're watching two different channels. Why do you like bachelorhood, Garfield? I can sum it up in a word...
- ""uncomplicated""
- That sounds simple. Simple, that's me. What is love to you, Garfield? Love is that exhilarating feeling you get when a vision of beauty comes walking to you.
- In fact, I just had that experience. When you saw me?
- When I saw my mirror this morning.
-
-
- POO!
-
- KONK!
- The harder you work for something, the more you appreciate it. Garfield, there's a mouse in the house, and I'm just sick about it.
- It chewed the toe out of my sock.
- I want you to catch it and kill it. Now I'M sick about it. Good morning, mouse. Good morning, cat.
- Make yourself at home. Gladly.
- But first, some house rules. Hey, cat, gimme a drumstick. Sure.
- Enjoy. What's your name, mouse? OK, gee. I don't think I have a name.
- Oh, come on, what do people say when they meet you?
- My name is Eek! We gotta give you a name, mouse.
- How about Crusher? How about Bruiser? How about Cat killer?
- How about Squeak? I like it. Here, Squeak, let me strap this key to your back. What's this for?
- I don't remember buying you a toy mouse, Garfield.
- Got the picture? You're a genius!
- A dimly lit street corner at midnight. This puts me in the mood for some snappy patter.
- Hey, good-lookin!. What's happening? Who are you?
- Names aren't important. Some call me a soldier of fortune, some call me a renaissance man. You can call me ""Major"". I love men in uniform.
- What say we go to Rick's Cafe Americain for a soda pop? I'm with you, big boy.
- Here's lookin' at you, sweetheart. SMACK! Rats. I think I chucked her chin a little hard. Hide! Here comes my owner!
- Why are we hiding? Jon wants me to eat you and I don't want to.
- You're so nice! Thanks for thinking of me. I was thinking of me. Okay, Squeak, here's the game plan. Every now and then, you show up in front of Jon and dance around until I appear on the scene and chase you away.
- In return, you get a nice home to live in, and I get to keep my job.
- This is a strange world we live in. You gotta play by the rules. Here's your cat food, Garfield.
- A MOUSE!
- That must be the surprise at the bottom of the box. Hey, Squeak, I found a great place for you to live!
- Jon will never think to look for you in this old log cabin.
- Nice, huh? Is it in a good school system? Thanks for the house, Garfield. A man needs a place to call his own. This is great! Don't mention it, kid.
-
- Listen carefully, Squeak. This is a mousetrap. Never, NEVER touch the tab in the center of it.
- You mean, this little tab here?
- This boy does not take direction well. Hey! That hurt!
-
- WAH HA HA HA!
- What a great sundae! Nothing can spoil my day.
- SCRATCH SCRATCH
- OH NO! MONDAY IS COMING! GARFIELD! COME HERE!
- ""Garfield"" this, ""Garfield"" tah. I'm sick of my name.
- HEY, FLEABAG! COME HERE! Then again: ""Garfield"" does have a certain ring on it. OH NO! A FLEA! I'M GETTING YOU A FLEA COLLAR, GARFIELD. Let's not be too hasty here.
- Look at those distinctive yellow and green markings there.
- This flea is a member of a rare species of vegetarians. Well, there's your new flea collar, Garfield.
- Wait a minute, there's a disclaimer on this box. ""Warning: while this collar will repel fleas...""
- ""It has been known to attract sharks."" DON'T TAKE THAT FLEA COLLAR OFF, GARFIELD! Who needs it?
-
- You have a pretty grim flea problem there, Odie.
- That's not a very strong flea collar.
- Did I ever tell you about my crazy uncle Berle? He thought he was a dog.
- The poor guy was always exhausted.
- He kept chasing himself up trees. Can we talk?
- I would like to speak to you about how wonderful cats are.
- Unlike dogs, they always land on their feet.
- They are more calm than dogs. ROWR!
- Every movement is a deliberate statement of grace and beauty.
- And when it comes to coordination, they are far superior to dogs. WHAP!
- BARK ! BARK! Doc Boy! How's my favorite little brother?
- Oh, things are pretty much the same here, wild parties, good times, the usual...
- Uh, you say you're coming to visit? It's put up or shut up time. What am I going to do, Garfield? My brother is coming to visit from the farm.
- He thinks I live life in the fast lane. ""Life in the parking lot"" is more like it.
- I don't know where he got the idea. It was when you told him you were negotiating movie rights to your diary. There's my brother now. * DING DONG
- Welcome to the big city, doc Boy! Let the good times roll!
- Another soda pop? No, I think I'll have some more of that fun-filled popcorn. I'm going to like Doc Boy. I'm so embarrassed. Doc Boy comes all the way from the farm just to find out what a loser I am. The truth always hurts.
- Hey, where are all those ""good times"" you promised me? What would you like to do?
- Let's go to the airport and watch the airplanes land. Whatever you say, wild man! Jon just got off the hook. Oh, by the way, Doc Boy, I've fixed us up on a double date. HEY, GREAT!
- What's a double date? That's when you and I go on a date together.
- Gee, it seems like it would be more fun if some girls came along. There's no hope. DOC BOY! OUR DATES ARE HERE!
- EEEEEEK!
- Can we talk? Can we laugh? Z
- SNORT! BLINK BLINK BLINK
- Rats! It's 4 A.M. and I'm wide awake.
- Fortunately, I know what to do.
- CLICK
- ARRRRRGH!
- If I can't sleep, neither will anyone else. I wonder who that could be, Doc Boy. DING DONG . Dad! Mom! What are you doing here!? We missed you boys, okay?
- A little paint, a few curtains, a woman's touch, this could be nice! My dad, the sentimental fool. My mom, the cliche. Your visit is such a surprise, mom. When's the last time you and dad went out? We haven't been off the farm since '53. I don't believe that.
- Good heavens! What's this? That's an indoor toilet, dad.
- WOO-HA! AIN'T SCIENCE SOMETHIN'? FLUSH NOW I believe it.
- You awake, Jon? click OF COURSE NOT, DAD! IT'S 5 A.M.! WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
- I GOTTA MILK SOMETHING! I'm leaving. You forgot this when you left home, Doc Boy. Thanks, mom, I haven't slept a wink without it.
- Whatcha got there, Doc Boy? NOTHING! NOTHING! IT'S NOTHING!
- Could it be a shred of your old blankie? Careful what you say about blankies, fella. Uh, mom...I wouldn't open that if I were you.
- EEEK!
- SOMETHING IN THERE MOVED! I'm sure it was just an optical illusion. GO ahead, tell her how the lunch meat has evolved into an intelligent life form. So long, son. We got a run. I miss my cows. Give them my best.
- SEE YUH, DOC BOY! THANKS FOR DECORATING MY HOUSE, MOM!
- Hello...undecorators? Jon is a man of good taste.
- PILLOW FIGHT! WHAP!
- You stay here. I'll be right back.
-
- AYIEEEEE
- WHONGO!
- What did you have in that pillow? I know this six-foot chicken. Garfield, I'm going to a cartoonists' convention, and the motel where I'm staying won't accept pets.
- Sorry, Odie. You can't go.
- Garfield, YOU are a pet. snap! Rats! I keep forgetting. I'm leaving for the cartoonists' convention now, Garfield. There's a week's worth of food for you. A week's worth, huh?
-
- It was more like 11 seconds' worth. I hope Jon comes back from that convention soon.
- I hope I can survive this week on my own.
- CLICK I hope this door isn't locked. What a tragic scenario...""Owner leaves for week...cat locks self out of house...cat starves in front porch"".
- Hey, wait a minute? I control my destiny! I don't have to starve on the front porch!
- ""Cat starves in bushes"". As long as I'm locked out of the house, I guess I'll strike out in search of food.
- Gee, this neighborhood doesn't look familiar to me.
- Oh, no! Where am I? I gotta figure a way to meet some chicks.
- You got a problem there, guy?
- Striking manly poses doesn't seem to be doing it. *
- *
- Rats! There's an alley full of mean guys waiting to beat me up!
- Maybe they won't hurt me if I look mean, too.
- Hey! It's working!
-
- Someday, I'm going to learn precisely where that fine line is, and I'm never going to cross it again! Garfield! I'm back from the convention! Where are you, big guy? ...Garfield?
- Oh, no! This is terrible! Garfield didn't get locked out or anything, did he, Odie?
- Yup. Hello, Garfield. Do I know you?
- Let me give you a hint...sit up straight, Don't talk with your mouth full. Wake up, sleepyhead.
- MOM! It's great seeing you again, mom. Yes, it's been a while.
- It seems like only yesterday.
- This was your first bed. It HAS been a while. Mom, I don't recognize this place. I thought I was born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant. It closed years ago, darling.
- It's all gone! Where's the pasta? The people? The pasta? The excitement? The pasta?
- You always did love to eat. Sniff...old habits are hard to break. Father, this is your grandson, Garfield. He will be staying with us for a while.
- If you're going to stay here, boy, you're going to be a mouser like the rest of us.
- So this is my grandson and you son, huh? Maybe they switched kittens in the maternity ward. If I have to be a mouser to stay here, grandpa, I'll do it! I have made a name for myself in the mousing game.
- Then eat that mouse. ARRRGH!!! Please! Please don't make me eat it!
- I'd rather swallow my pride than that mouse. RRRRR Okay, okay. Let's get something to eat.
-
- No cats allowed!
-
-
-
- I've been human for 10 minutes now, but I haven't forgotten my roots. Gee, I miss having Garfield around. I even miss the abuse.
- RRR!
- Thanks, Odie, but it just isn't the same. I'd love to catch your mice, grandpa, But I haven't seen any worthy of my time, got anything bigger? Bring on the training mouse!
-
- Me and my big mouth. I'm sorry I can't stay, mom. It's for the best, dear. You'd better hurry home. It's almost Christmas.
- Christmas! I almost forgot!
- I also forgot I'm lost. Well, this is just great. I'm cold, I'm hungry, I'm tired...
- It's snowing to beat the band, and I haven't the foggiest idea where I am.
- While everyone else is having a white Christmas, I'm going to have a white lost. I'm cold, I'm hungry and I'm tired.
- They say, in cases like this, you should fight sleep.
- I say, why fight an old friend? Garfield! Wake up! You're near home!
- Huh? Mom? Wha...?!
- Wow...it never looked better.
- This is going to be one sad Christmas without Garfield.
- SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH
-
- BLAT!
- GARFIELD! SPEAK TO ME! ARE YOU OKAY?!
- Actually, yes. I just thought it would be more dramatic this way. I missed you so much, Garfield! This is going to be the best Christmas ever, because you're here. Jon?
- You never realize how much you love someone until they go away. tap tap tap Jon? Jon? Jon?
- What is it, Garfield? Read my lips. I'm hungry! MERRY CHRISTMAS, BOYS.
- There's nothing like having the whole family together at Christmas, right?
- Hey, Garfield, a late Christmas package arrived for you from my mom. OH NO!
- Why, it's your annual Christmas sweater! I'll bet you thought she forgot. There was always the hope.
- You should send her a ""thank you"" now. I'll get a letter bomb out immediately. I'll give you 10 zillion dollars for that cup of coffee.
- There you go again! Every, I say, EVERY MORNING you steal my coffee. GUSH
- Aw, isn't that sweet? Our little ritual. Why is it my coffee cups keep disappearing?
-
- AHA! I must have a word with the maid. When you own pets, you get hardened to the fact they will be around your food.
- Lose something, Garfield? Nope, here's my stripe.
- It's that time of year again.
- This year I resolve to lose weight, exercise more and sleep less.
-
- Then what are you going to do after you've accomplished all that?
- I suppose you're going to be nice to Odie and kowtow to Jon and lick the mailman's boots!
- I DON'T LIKE YOU ALREADY.
- Once again I've survived a new year with my vices intact. Hey, Garfield, get up. A new year is almost upon us! Great! Wake me next year.
- Come on. I'm having a party tonight and I want you to be there. If you insist. That was some new year's celebration last night, wasn't it, Garfield? Did anyone get the license number of the party that hit me?
- Are you going to get up today? No way! I got up yesterday and look what happened to me!
- Not feeling well, huh? It would take two of me to feel worse. I don't mind grocery shopping.
- And I don't mind carrying them home.
- This is the part I dread. As long as you're in the way, why don't you find a place to put these groceries.
- GOBBLE! GOBBLE! GOBBLE!
- I wanted you to put them in the pantry! Urp...that can be arranged. Okay, guys, I have a new house rule.
- From now on no pets are allowed on the furniture.
- Harf! Harf! Harf! Wah! Ha! Ha! I don't get no respect.
- One thing I love about Odie...
- He's so pushoffable. I'm bored.
- I'm bored, bored, bored.
- Wait a minute! I control my own destiny! I'll create an exclusive country club resort.
- First, I'll put some sandbox sand in the sunbeam.
- Replete with the usual resort accouterments.
- Hey, what a great idea!
- I wonder how he got by the membership committee. Well, the holidays are finally over and the ol' waistline has explored new vistas. pat pat
- It is time to declare another NATIONAL FAT WEEK. We shall tell skinny jokes and revel in our fat.
- I'm talking about you, chubby. We fat people get a lot more out of life. We eat big. We drink big, we laugh big.
- HAR! HAR! HAR!
- Are you okay, Garfield? You wouldn't understand, skinny person. Being skinny isn't always a bed of roses.
- It must be tough wearing suspenders to hold your socks up.
- I knew a guy who was so skinny, he had to step on the scales twice to weight himself! I think skinny people are funny...
- Their pants keep falling down. thump thump thump
- I knew a kid who was so skinny, all he could wear was a hat! Don't eat that pie! It's fattening! Eat it!
- You'll regret it tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes!
- FLIP I'd be thinner if my conscience were quicker-witted. Fat people are healthier than skinny people in many ways...
- For instance, no fat person has ever been diagnosed as having vatorphobia.
- That, of course, is the fear of starving to death in a stuck elevator. This is my lucky day.
-
- Wha...? SCRIIICK POOF!
- It grew back!
- I've discovered the bottomless pan of lasagna!
- BLIP
- I knew it! I knew it! I knew it was too good to be true!
- SLUP!
- THAT WAS MY LAST CUP OF COFFEE! I spilled some. You can suck it out of my sweater. What are you watching, Garfield? I don't know.
- Who's the lead character? I don't know.
- What's the plot? Hey! I'm watching television! Stop making me think, okay? SLURP GULP BURP SMACK ERP
- OH YUK! How disgusting! There's a people hair in my cat food! One of my pet peeves is people who never finish what they start.
- I do not happen to be one of those people.
- My philosophy is, ""never start anything."" BLAT! Oops!
- Clean that up, Garfield. Patience, my friend.
- There are people to do those things. ZIP! OOOOO
- BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
- I'll bite. What is it? A dummy detector.
- tappity tappity tappity
- tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity
-
- BONK!
- PANT PANT plunk
- CLAP CLAP CLAP Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! zip!
- Hey! Give my napkin back!
- Smile when you speak to Sumo Cat, fella. Sumo Cat has studied Sumo wrestling for years.
- Sumo Cat has mastered the most dreaded tricks of his trade.
- SNAP! Sumo Cat assumes the classic Sumo wrestling position.
- There is only one tiny drawback to this position...
- Severe cramping! Karate Cat demonstrates his art on a table leg.
- HIIYAH! SNAP!
- Karate Cat also demonstrates incredible lack of foresight. Most practitioners of Karate are impervious to pain.
- HIIYAH! SMACK!
- I happen to be of the previous to pain persuasion. For your pleasure, I, Judo Cat, will lay a basic move on this hapless bystander.
- SMACK!
- Leave it up to a dumb dog's rubber tongue to make a mockery of the martial arts.
- Fetch the apple, Odie.
-
- I send Odie to fetch an apple, and he brings back an apple pie. I think I'm onto something here.
- Fetch the T-bone, Odie, my boy.
- Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the cutest cat of all?
- Hi there.
- Don't answer that. Do you know what I hate about you, Nermal? You're so one dimensional.
- Oh yeah? And what dimension is that?
- YOUTH! Nermal, you're cute, but you're not very bright. Doesn't that bother you?
- Oh no.
- I figure I'll grow out of this cute stage sooner or later. I rest my case. Nermal, would you rather have your good looks or my intellect?
- My good looks.
- I have years and years to get your intellect. That hurt. Nermal, would you like to be like me when you grow up?
- Gosh yes! I'd like to be like you when I grow up.
- And up, and up, and out, and out, and up. That boy may not see his next birthday. I gotta go, Garfield. I'm posing for a cat calendar.
- How does one pose for a calendar? One moment.
- That's very good. Cute is my life. Hey, Odie! Look at this!
- It's snowing! Let's go out and catch snowflakes on our tongues!
-
- Here comes a world record!
-
- Ooo, that's a very impressive collection.
- Surprise boys! I fixed a feast for you! No thanks. We just ate. Urp. SPLUT!
- OH NO!
- Yup...it's splut week.
-
- SPLUT! ssssssss
- sssssssss
- sssSSSSPLUT! Good evening, ladies and germs!
- SPLUT! SPLUT! SPLUT!
- Thank you for that generous round of spluts! SPLUT!
- Hey, wait a minute! Shoes don't go ""splut""!
- SPLUT! That's more like it. I'm tired of getting hit with pies all the time.
- I'm going to find whoever is doing it, and I'm going to bite him. flick
- SPLUT! SPLUT!
- Good morning, Garfield. Hi there.
-
-
- WHA?!
- You're everywhere at once! How do you do that? Magic.
- AMAZING! Thanks, guys. Can't you close your mouth to eat? You're hard to look at.
- You mean, this bothers you? Yuk!
- I see no humor in that, Garfield. Then why am I chortling? A house becomes a home once it's well established with cat hair.
- Oh no! This is not a cat hair! It's a whisker!
- I'm going bald! You're shedding again. What am I supposed to do with all this cat hair? Knit the world's largest hairball.
- Trade it with your friends, start a mustache factory.
- This is going nowhere. Insulate your house! Filter your coffee! Did you know there are three kinds of cat hair? There's the common, way to clean kind...
- There's the kind that disappears into the carpet, never to be seen again. And then there's my favorite...
- There's the kind that hangs in the air forever. LAND! DARN IT! LAND! Well, I've swept under the furniture, vacuumed my chair and shaken the rugs. I'm finally rid of all your cat hair.
-
- Fortunately, I keep an emergency supply in the back of my bed. You boys sure shed a lot.
- Wha?! SHOOP!
- The cat hair refuses to associate with the dog hair. sniff.. DINNER TIME, GARFIELD!
- I ran out of canned cat food. I'm sure you know what to do with this dried stuff.
- I certainly do.
-
- WHOAAA!
- Enjoying your cat food, Garfield? We must have it more often. WHIRRR!
- FWUMP! WHAT WAS THAT?!
- Hi, Squeak! Get me out of here! How are you, Squeak? How would you feel if you got sucked up in a vacuum cleaner?
- How humiliating! Me, a mouse, sucked up like a common piece of dirt. That's just my luck! What are the chances of that ever happening?
- whirrrr SHOOP! Getting better all the time, I'd say. Hey, Garfield, I'm missing a slipper, two spools of thread and a button...
- You don't know where they are, would you? I think I do...
- May I have a word with you, Squeak? Vroom! Vroom! Why are people afraid of mice? Bad press, I guess.
- Maybe it's because mice carried the black plague in 1348. I don't know what you're talking about.
- As I recall, half of Europe died.
- Picky, picky, picky. Would you look at that mousetrap?! Barbaric, isn't it.
- You said it! A nice camembert or creamy brie would be worth going in after.
- BUT THAT PROCESSED AMERICAN CHEESE IS AN INSULT TO MY PALATE! Precisely what I was saying. You're lazy, Garfield. Lazy, do you hear me? If you had any ambition, you could be anything you want.
- Like the world's greatest mouser?
- Lazy, I admire that in a cat.
- Hmmm
- click click
- Okay, your move.
-
- GARFIELD!
- How many times have I told you not to play with your food? Hey, Garfield, what say we have potatoes for dinner?
- Gee, it's been a long time since I fixed potatoes.
- Tell me about it. Trivia time, Garfield!
- What's the only substance on earth harder than a diamond?
- Your leftover pizza. I have just taken an inventory of your refrigerator.
- !89 bottles of salad dressing with 1"" in the bottom of each. 14 half empty bottles of catsup, 39 open cans of flat soda pop and 62 bread wrappers with the heels.
- ORGANIZE YOURSELF! SMACK! EEEEK!
- Clean your refrigerator out, Jon! The mystery meat crawled out of the tinfoil and snapped at me! knock knock Who's there?
- Uhhh...candy gram? You can't fool me, mystery meat. You want out to wreak havoc.
- Today the refrigerator, tomorrow the world!
- I wonder if I should clean the refrigerator.
- The bacon is gazing on the lettuce and he asks if the refrigerator needs cleaning. OH NO!
- GARFIELD! YOU'RE SITTING IN MY SCRAMBLED EGGS! They're warm.
- Okay, okay, here...enjoy.
- NO, go ahead and sit in them, they're ruined now. RUINED?
- JUST BECAUSE I STAY IN 'EM, IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR STUPID SCRAMBLED EGGS ARE DISEASED, YOU KNOW!
- UNNNGH! EAT 'EM! EAT 'EM!
- HUBERT! THE CAT'S FEEDING JON! Pack your bags, Reba! We're moving for sure this time! It's time for your checkup, Garfield. I'll get checked-up while the lady vet gets checked out.
- We gotta make sure you're in good condition. Right.
- The only condition he's worried about is his glandular condition. Good morning, Mr. Arbuckle.
- How did you know it was me? I wasn't even in the door yet! you have a distinctive cologne.
- Oh, you mean my ''Ode De Lumberjack""? Bingo. How about a date, doc? Oh, let's not and say we did.
- That's better than nothing, I guess.
- Can we say I kissed you good night? If we can say I slapped you. Let's be honest with one another, Liz.
- I'm a man. You're a woman. Get the picture?
- That's the door. Get the picture? You'll have to draw it for him, doc. Do you think these shaders make me more mysterious? YOU don't need them.
- Hey, good-lookin', what time do you get off work?
- You just propositioned my coat rack. He might get lucky this time. In case you're thinking about asking me out, doc, forget it. I have plans.
- I'm seeing this girl, ho is real cute and real clever and we laugh a lot. Do tell...
- My, my, my! Do I detect a note of jealousy in your voice? I walked into that one? Sigh.
- Garfield, you are worthless. Do you know that?
- You are doing zero with your life...zip. Do you know that? poke poke
- You should learn something new each day. It would lend purpose to this dreary existence of yours.
- I'm going to the store. When I come back, I want you to have learned something.
- I'm home, Garfield. Did you learn anything?
- I learned how to use your credit card. Ah ah ahhhh! Don't touch that dial. We'll be right back.
-
- Our cat food is new and improved!
- New and improved! New and improved!
- Just think...all this time I've been eating old and inferior. Rats! Where's the Binky The Clown Show?! click click click
- This remote control must be malfunctioning. click click click
- NOW it works. NO NO! DON'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL! WE NEED THE RATINGS!
- PLEEEEEASE! CLICK! Arrrgh!
- Choice is a powerful thing.
- CLICK
- Whatever Jon paid for this TV remote control, it was worth it! These game shows are disgusting.
- It's pathetic how some people will humiliate themselves to win money.
- Jon does it for free. *
- That's a pretty impressive display of shedding there, Odie.
- But there isn't a dog born who can outshed a cat.
-
- Take that!
-
- I WON! I WON! SURF'S UP! SURF'S UP!
- Garfield the Surfer King hangs three.
- You're acting strangely lately, Garfield. You live in your world, I'll live in mine. Garfield, the vet says you are going to have to stay inside. There's a rare strain of Hawaiian cat flu going around.
-
- Too late, doc. Garfield, the vet says the Hawaiian cat flu will give you a voracious appetite and make you listless and cranky.
-
- I guess we'll never know if you're sick or not! I saw that one coming. Garfield, you have the Hawaiian cat flu. You're going to have to lie around all week. Oh, darn.
- And you must stay inside. WHAT?!
- For the first time in my life, I gotta get out! Garfield, I know you are suffering from the Hawaiian cat flu, but you look ridiculous doing that hula dance.
- Watch my hands carefully, Jon.
- Every movement has a meaning! BONK! You look much better this morning. You must be over the Hawaiian cat flu. I doubt that I ever had it.
- What would you like for breakfast? Just some juice and a Danish.
- And a roast pig! And six pineapples! And a pound of Macadamia nuts! Hey, hey.
- Smile big, boys. I'm going to take your picture.
- Move back a little farther.
- Just a little farther.
- SHOOP!
- Uh-oh.
- There appears to be a camera shoved up your nose. Nas wha I min nrying noo nell you! Mondays, I hate mondays. It seems like I just get done with one and along comes another one!
-
- Did you know you're cute when you're angry?
- All right! A new world record!
- Six chins. HOLY GOOD GRAVY!
- I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD A BELLYBUTTON!
- zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?
- CRACK! tinkle tinkle
- Shards shards on the floor... SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH
- tap tap tap
- It's okay, Jon...I've subdued the chair. It's safe to sit in now. There's only one drawback to an assertive lifestyle.
- CRASH!
- Sometimes you get the bear, and sometimes the bear gets you.
- Here, Garfield. Eat! CLOMP!
- Just look at you! You're a fright!
- I get up early and groom myself because this is our special time together!
- And the only place you take me is for granted!
-
- Are you trying to tell me something, Garfield? I'm just showing you what happens when the magic goes out of our relationship. The mailman is going to rue the day he put on that silly uniform when he opens Jon's mailbox today.
- Boy, is he going to be surprised.
- Boy, am I stuck. Here I am, Garfield the cat, doomed to spend the rest of my days in this stupid mailbox. What a cruel twist of fate.
- HEY, FATE! HERE'S WHAT I THINK OF YOU!
- PLPLPL Leave it up to me to get stuck in this mailbox. So much for my ambush attempt on the mailman.
- Here he comes now!
- *
- Thanks, Garfield.
- I can see the headlines now. ""Cat stuck in mailbox somehow manages to severely injure local man."" I gotta get out of this mailbox. My deodorant is starting to give out.
- RATTLE RATTLE
- The story of my life.
- UNNNGH!
- We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor.
- Quick, Garfield! During the commercial let's get some popcorn!
- I'll take care of the butter, bowls and napkins. You take care of the popcorn!
- I got MY stuff, are you taking care of the popcorn?! Yup!
- Welcome back. WE MADE IT!
-
- Where's the popcorn? (burp) I took care of it.
-
- I've been awake one second and my day is ruined. *
- rrrrrrr
- Oh, listen, Jon! They're playing our song! SHOOMP! Garfield, you eat like a pig. You should chew your food 25 times before swallowing.
- Right. I'll give it a shot...just one thing...
- What's chew? It's fun to find familiar shades in the clouds.
- There's an old standard.
- A dog cloud chasing a a cat cloud up a tree cloud. Good morning, morning.
- What a great day to be alive.
- I'd even go so far as to say it's a great day to be awake. Hey, Garfield. Hey, Odie. I have a little piece of leftover steak. Who
- SHOOM!
- wants it? Z
- Z clickety clickety clickety.
- CLICKETY CLICKETY CLICKETY
- CLICKETY CLICKETY CLACK CLACK
- I'M AWAKE! I'M AWAKE! CLICKETY CLACK CLACK
- You've never done the Flamenco the get me up before.
- The castanets were a nice touch. That's because I care. Garfield, I'd like you to meet my new goldfish.
- What shall we name it?
- ""Sushi"" comes to mind.
-
- Don't even think about it. A lot of people don't like fish. You can't hug them. You can't take them for a walk on a leash.
- They have no sense of humor and all they do is eat and sleep.
- Wait a minute! I just described me! Come here, you.
- PLOOP
- What are you doing with my goldfish, Garfield? Would you believe I was trying to kiss it good night? OH NO!
- DON'T LOCK ME UP! I'LL BE GOOD! I SWEAR!
- Oh. I've decided to let you live, little fella.
- Oh sure, you're probably thinking way down deep I'm a mister nice guy...
- Well, set one fin out that cage and you're history. I'm leaving for a few minutes, Garfield. You be good, hear?
- SLAM!
- Good! Jon's gone! Now I can do all the fun stuff he won't let me do!
- I can run in the house.
- I can eat the ferns and swallow without chewing.
- I can jump on the bed.
- GARFIELD, I'M HOME!
- Thank goodness you're home! I almost funned myself to death! I think I'll get today started off on the right foot. pat pat
- PUNT! . My heart says ""yes"", but, my right foot said, ""no"". Hey, Garfield! Come and get it! Come and get ""it"", he says.
- Just what is an ""it""? Is ""it"" a hamburger? Is ""it"" cat food?
- Nope, ""it"" is just an ""it"". ODIE! DON'T CHASE CARS! YOU COULD GET CLOBBERED! YIP! YIP! YIP!
- Clobbered?
- Hey, Odie! Here comes a Buick that said unkind things about your mother! I have a date with Mary Lou tonight and I'm going to charm her out of her socks.
- I'm going to play it real cool. I'm going to quote poetry and be real suave.
- She'll be putty in my hands. You tie is in your coffee. Surprise, Garfield! I made you some weenie gelatin!
- gobble slurp smack gulp
- Well, what do you think? My mouth liked it, but my stomach is still making up its mind. Get off the curtains, Garfield. Why?
- Get off the curtains or I'll have you declawed.
- You just can't argue with logic. It's time to get up.
- It's time to gorge myself.
- It's time to kick the dog. PUNT!
- It's time for a nap ion front of the television.
- It's time to eat my afternoon fern.
- It's time for my 14-hour beauty rest. I'm a creature of habit...all the bad ones. Hey, Judy! How are you, cuz? Yeah, we'll be home. Come on over.
- Sure, bring the kids, too.
- Garfield? Tierra del Fuego My cousin Judy is coming to visit and she's bringing her children.
- So put everything you value out of reach.
- Hi, Judy! How are you, cousin?
- And this must be Tammy. YOOOOOO! IT STINKS HERE! IT SMELLS LIKE A CAT!
- Sniff, sniff, yoooo! Where's that kid smell coming from? Garfield, this is my cousin Judy and her children, Tammy and Stevie.
- BALL! BALL!
- Oh, listen! Stevie's first words! And his last. Do you know why I don't like kids?
- I'll give you three guesses.
- And the first two don't count. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- THERE HE IS!
- I'm sure your mother has told you not to play with sharp objects. z z z
- Yup!
- I'm glad I'm not a bird.
- All they ever do is eat worms and sit in the birdbath.
- They never have any fun.
-
- Lucky me. Jon's cousin Judy comes to visit and she brings her two yard apes, Tammy and Stevie.
- They're basically good kids, I guess.
- For werewolves. I like to hang around babies at mealtime. They drop all kinds of good food.
-
- Sometimes they need encouragement. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
- I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry!
- I have some friends who can see to it she's never heard from again. Hello, what's this?
-
- Ready for lunch, Garfield?
- Oh, no, thank you. I just had my first encounter with a diaper bag. Okay, Tammy, stop jumping on the bed.
-
- MOMMEEEEE! It was nice seeing you again, Judy. We must do this again!
- Yeah, let's have lunch...
- About ten thousand years from now! Dinnertime, Garfield!
- MUNCH! SMACK! GOBBLE! SLURP!
- GULP! CRUNCH! CHOMP! GOBBLE! SLURP!
- UUUNGH!
- HA-HAAA!
- I'm so proud of Jon. I've taught him everything he knows about gluttony. RRRR
- Rats! I always run out of milk before I run out of cookie!
- BOING!
- You should warn me when you put in the screen door! We cats are special. We are built to sense things about humans even they don't know.
-
- Your feet stink.
- That's a pretty funky dance, Garfield. Show me how you do it.
- First, find a bur in your sandbox. We're going to the vet, Garfield. I wonder what she'll remove this time.
- Any last words? My uncle Patrick's famous quote comes to mind.
- ""I regret that I have but nine lives to give to my country"". I love this time of year. There's the first bluebird.
- There's the first daisy.
- DONK
- There's the first rake in the face. Come here, Garfield. I have something to tell you.
- I'm going to organize my sock drawer today. This is a red-letter day!
- I'm going to put the black ones on one end and the white ones on the other. Decisions! Decisions! Decisions!
- And do you know what I might do after that? Oh no! Spare me! Spare me!
- I might tighten the hinges on my reading glasses. ARRRGH!
- OH WHEN WILL THIS MAD, CRAZY, MERRY-GO-ROUND EXISTENCE EVER END?
- Or I might give a certain wise guy cat a bath. I'll tuck, you sort. Mornin', hon. Mornin', Irma.
- Say when.
- When. These people need help. HEY! WHERE'S THE WAITRESS IN THIS CRUMMY DIVE?! THE SERVICE HERE STINKS! WHO'S THE MANAGER HERE ANYWAY?! You are.
- SMACK! Forgot. I'm going home. smack! TWO EGGS SCRAMBLED, PIGS IN BLANKET, AND GIVE IT WINGS!
- ZIP!
- Two eggsa scrambled! Pigs in a blanket! Pronto! This is a small operation. We should kill it before it spreads. Do you know what I like about your place, Irma? You're open 24 hours.
-
- I'm giving serious consideration to taking on an assistant. I don't see how you do it, Irma.
- How do you keep this place open 24 hours with no help?
- Z Now I see how she does it. Sheer willpower. Here's your egg, hon. Whatever you do, try not to think about where it came from.
-
- Have an egg, Garfield. Too late. I already thought about it. Boy, am I starved.
- Here y'are, hon. Thanks, Irma.
-
- Uh, Irma.
- Don't mind me, hon.
- I think I lost a false eyelash in here somewhere.
- Sardi's this ain't. I think I'll exercise.
- I'd better start slowly.
- Today I shall attempt to register a pulse. KABONG! KABONG! KABONG! KABONG! Garfield, get out of here!
- And take your pogo stick with you! Let's talk about the responsibilities an owner assumes when he obtains a cat. The first responsibility is to feed that cat.
- LATER!
- I guess we'll wait to discuss the second responsibility when we're in a little better mood. Hey, Garfield, here's an article about a guy who thought he could fly by wearing a cape and jumping off a building.
- They scraped him off Fifth Avenue with a putty knife. I guess he learned his lesson.
- Yeah, he didn't believe. Good morning, Job. Hmmph
- SMACK! BLUT!
- I'm feeling good about today so don't burst my bubble, okay? Oh goody! Jon's home!
-
- When Mr. Excitement steps into the room, you can cut the apathy with a knife. Hmmm
- All cats are innately curious. I was just wondering where rainwater goes.
- WHOA!
-
- Gasp!
- So this is where rainwater goes! Interesting!
- So this is where dishwater goes! Fascinating. So this is where bathwater goes! That's the last time I drink out of the toilet. Good morning, Garfield. Mmmph.
- What was that? Mmmph.
- I can't understand you. I ate all the ice cream and my mouth went numb, okay? Sniff
- Remember, as you walk down the path of life...
- Stop and eat the flowers along the way. What's the difference between flowers and weeds?
- STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- Weeds have a greater will to live.
- Hey, Jon!
- When was the last time you swept under the bed? Surprise, Garfield!
- I picked up lunch at grease world!
- Junk food is the staff of life.
- kiss
- Pets always sense when you're going to the grocery. Buy me a steak.
- Look at Jon's socks, they are all perfectly tucked and organized.
- Okay, socks, line up! Count off!
- FORWARD HARCH! ONE! TWO! THREE! FOURP!
- Stay away from my sock drawer, Garfield. You make me nervous.
-
- As you were.
-
- Clear your head, Jon. There has to be a logical explanation for this, other than the teddy bear isn't housebroken. Pick up your stuff, Garfield. STUFF?! Pooky isn't STUFF! He's a real, live, feeling, breathing...
- Uh...inanimate object. That sun is pretty strong today, Pooky. A guy could burn if he's not careful.
-
- Do you know why I love Pooky?
- It is said we were given two ears and only one mouth so that we can tell only half of what we hear...
- Pooky has two ears and no mouth. So, this is the bedtime story you want to hear, huh?
- ""Bangor the Enforcer screamed, 'The world is ours!' at that very moment teddy bears everywhere crawled out of their toy chests and armed themselves"".
- This is a side of teddy bears I'd as soon not know. And then about April of '81 or was it '82, my voice changed and I started singing the baritone part.
- Gee, Pooky. I'm tired of talking about me...
- YOU talk about me for a while. Persons At Work
- How fortuitous, someone was kind enough to dig this hole for me.
- I'll cover it with these branches and play a little trick on Odie.
- Hey, Odie, have a bone.
- BOING!
- Something's not right here.
- OH NO! IT'S THE OLD RUBBER HOLE GAG! This sun is enough to bake your brains.
-
- That, of course, doesn't affect Odie. It must be a zillion degrees out there, Garfield.
- Let's turn on the radio and find out what the temperature is.
- You mean this radio?
- SURPRISE!
- Happy birthday, Garfield! I had a feeling this was coming. Observe, beating the heat is simply a matter of mind over body.
- I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm cold.
- Unfortunately, my body has a mind of its own.
-
- Have some lemonade, Garfield.
- GUSH!
- Refreshed? Yo. Sleeping, we do more of it than anything else in life, and know very little about it.
- Welcome to the ""Wonderful World Of 'Sleep"". Today we will examine fascinating sleeping positions.
- Z Jon here is demonstrating the classic fetal position.
- Odie is in your basic armchair poily position. Z
- When you sleep as much as I do, you crave variety in your attitudes of repose.
- For your edification, I shall now attempt the world's most bizarre sleeping position!
- Z oooo Hey, all you turkeys! You have to go to work and I don't!
-
- Spare time would be more fun if I had less to spare. I love lying on the sill watching the rain.
- KA-BOOM!
- I love lying under the bed listening to the rain.
-
- What do you suppose the chances are of me leaping from this sill and having the window slam shut on my tail?
- SLAM!
- Do I know me or what? Most cats would be angry hanging by the tail from a window.
- But not me.
- I'M FURIOUS! Let me get you out of the window, Garfield.
- There you go. BONK!
- I don't know whether to thank Jon, or kill him. Shoo-doop boowa, shoo-doop boowa.
- Well I was workin' last night on my piston head, when my best friend told me my girl was dead.
- Well, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure
- I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure
- KA-CHUNK I'll sure
- miss herrrrr. This tree is tempting me to climb it, but I'm standing my ground this time.
- YOU WHAT?!
- I can't resist a double dare. I'll get out of this tree sooner or later. Cats always do.
- No cat has ever lived his whole life up a tree.
- I have. You stay out of this. What's your name? Ed.
- Now let me get this straight, Ed. You say you've never been on the ground?
- What's ground? I see... Come clean, Ed. You can't tell me you've never been on the ground. That's impossible.
- Maybe you're right.
- Mom, have I ever been on the ground? What's ground? Garfield, I'd like you to meet my twin brother, Ted.
- Ed! Ted is a squirrel!
- No wonder mother always liked him best! This is just great. Here I am stuck up a tree with a cat who's been raised by squirrels.
- SQUAWK!
- Now what are you doing? Storing birds for the winter. Let's see, it's over and under, then through.
- I'm taking you out to eat, Garfield. You'll have to wear this to get into the restaurant.
- I'll have a steak and my ca...er...son will have a triple order of lasagna and a cup of cocoa.
- This is an exclusive restaurant, Garfield. Use your silverware. GULP! SLURP! GULP!
- That marshmallow is meant for your cocoa.
- Heh, heh. Don't lick your paws at the table, son.
- That's the rudest little kid I've ever seen! He even shed on the tablecloth. Can you imagine a cat being raised by squirrels? I gotta get Ed out of this tree before it's too late.
- Too late for what?
- Never mind. It's time we get out of this tree, Ed. How do we do that?
- CRACK!
- Funny you should ask. Welcome to your first step on earth, Ed! What do you think?
- Wow! Wild! Weird!
- What are you doing? I've never walked sideways sideways before. Well, Ed, what do you think of your first trip out of your tree?
- Ed?
- I think I have a fear of low places. Since you've been raised by squirrels, Ed, you have a lot to learn about being a cat.
- What is that? That is a dog. Cats are afraid of dogs.
- What? I have forgotten. I gotta go home, Garfield. What for?
- I miss mother, the squirrel. You're weird, Ed.
- You're lucky, too.
- King Cattaeatalotta gives a peace offering to the volcano that claimed young princess Angora.
- Up against the wall, you crumbums, or I'll give your backsides a taste of my daisy!
- Make love, not dog pounds.
- Here, my dear, perhaps this will will make up for leaving you alone to fend off the border guards.
- AHEE AH-EE AH!
- WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FLOWER BED?! Scuttlebutt at the precinct is that your daisies were vandalized by an overactive imagination. Ha, ha, ha! I love my new Monday suit. CLANK CLANK
- Nothing can get me now. CLANK
- CREAK Except possibly rust. Something is not right here.
- WHAM! I knew it!!!
- Today is Monday cleverly disguised as Tuesday. There's nothing more annoying than a leaky faucet. DRIP DRIP DRIP
- DRIP DRIP DRIP DRIP
- DRIP DRIP DRIP Unless it's a leaky dog. DRIP DRIP DRIP DRIP
- DRIP DRIP DRIP Come here, Odie.
- DRIP DRIP DRIP Let me tighten your gasket.
-
- Get rid of the dog! Look at those cars out there, Garfield. What a fascinating assemblage.
- All those people in their tiny steel universes, moving to the choreography of the traffic light.
- What are your observations on the subject, Garfield? 17 blue ones have gone by 11 red ones.
- Hey, Garfield! It's going to be a beautiful day! Let's spend it outside!
- Where are my swim trunks?
- There's suntan lotion in here somewhere.
- And now a picnic lunch!
- PERFECT DAY, HERE WE COME!
- Rats. Missed it. Ladies and gentlemen, for your entertainment pleasure, I've added music to my act.
- I am proud to introduce the man with the plan from the street with the beat.
- Mr. Skins! I knew a dog who was o ugly, he had to...
- TIDDY-BOOM!
- Let's talk timing. But seriously though, folks, how am I doing so far?
- SPLAT!
- Et tu, rhythm section? I knew a dog who was so ugly, his fleas wore dog collars!
- TIDDY-BOOM TIDDY-BOOM TIDDY-BOOM TIDDY-BOOM TIDDY-BOOM
- Padding our part, are we? And now for the dog joke of the night.
- Mr. Skins, may I have a drum roll please?
- And now for a brief musical interlude with Mr. Skins.
- NO! NO! NOT THAT ONE! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
- Not the ""Lithuanian Rain Dance"" Ooch! Eech! Ouch!
-
- Hot, hot, hot. It's hot out there.
- It's too hot to move. It's too hot to think, It's just too hot.
-
- rrr ft
- Garfield! Odie!
- Stop fighting. Here you are, Garfield. I call it ""Breakfast Surprise"".
- BLAT!
- If I wanted a surprise, I'd eat in the dark.
-
- It's times like this I wish Odie could talk. Do you want something to eat, boys? BARK! BARK!
- Do you? Huh? huh? YIP! YIP! BARK!
- The word ""dignity"" is not in a dog's vocabulary. I am cat, hear me roar, I am too big to ignore. SNAP!
-
- Perhaps I should consider a career change.
-
- It's shorts weather. BARK!
- Hey, Odie. Come back here.
- Do that again. I can still hear a little out of this ear. Oh yuk! A spider!
- Hold still, spider, while I squash you with this window.
- SLAM! tinkle tinkle
- PLOP!
- CRASH!
- KA-BOOM!
- Rats! Missed it. Look what you did to that chair, Garfield, You're too fat.
- I am not too fat. They just don't make chairs the way they used to.
- They don't make doors the way they used to either. Garfield, you wouldn't be fat if your eyes weren't larger than your stomach.
-
- THAT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION! Garfield, I'm putting you on a diet. ARRRGH!
- I know you hate diets. If you can think of a better way to lose weight, I'm willing to listen.
- Amputate something! Ah, there is nothing more refreshing than a leaf of fresh lettuce for the wight conscious.
- Thank you so much for the delightful diet, Jon.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to die now.
- There's an interesting bit of diet trivia.
- A pie cut into tiny slices has fewer calories than an entire pie.
- ZIP
- Hey, Garfield! Come here quick!
- Look, Garfield, the carnival has come to town! Let's go! Whoopty doo.
- Do you know what I love most about a carnival? the intellectual stimulation?
- I love the sideshow. Uh, Jon?
- The fat woman! The rubber man! the dinosaur boy! JON!
- Save your money. Before
-
- After
-
- How's the coffee? It's a little weak. Okay, Mr. Finicky Eater, here's your dinner. What is it?
- It's Coquille Saint-Jacques garnished with Belgian endive and laced with French truffles.
- AGAIN?! See what you think about my lemonade, Garfield.
-
- Needs sugar? Needs sugar.
-
- These new sodas are great.
- They're sugar-free and caffeine-free.
- And flavor-free. Garfield, where are you going?
- GARFIELD!
- Well, I hope you feel like a complete idiot. That is a hot dog truck, not a hot dog. I do feel sorta silly.
- NOW WHAT?!
- Now for dessert. Z
- HEY!
- When there's napping to do around here, I'LL do it. You're late for dinner, Garfield.
- I assume you have a good excuse.
- My morning nap raged out of control. Rats.
- I hate it when this happens to me.
- Daytime insomnia.
-
- I FELL ASLEEP ON MY TENNIS RACKET, OKAY?! Oh. There must be millions of ants down there.
- I wonder how you tell the difference between boy ants and girl ants.
- I guess they didn't have any trouble figuring it out. Hey, bug. You're ugly.
- You're creepy.
- You're history. SQUIK *
- Eat me.
- I can't eat you. You're Jon's favorite fern. What are fronds for?
- I might get in trouble. Aw, come on. Take one little taste. You'll like me.
-
- MUNCH CHOMP MUNCH CHOMP
- GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! Just trying to make everybody happy. Thank you. Gee, Jon's pancakes sure look good.
- I'd love to take them from him, but I'm not that kind of guy.
- But the Caped Avenger is! The Lone Ranger has Tonto, the Green Hornet has Kato, and Batman has Robin. The Caped Avenger needs a sidekick too.
-
- Then again, I may go this a capella. As the new sidekick of the Caped Avenger, you need a neat name. What shall I call you?
- SLURP
- Come along, ""Slurp"". Slurp, as the Caped Avenger's sidekick, you need a costume.
-
- You've missed the point. Okay, Slurp, go out and find a costume befitting the sidekick of the Caped Avenger.
-
- Rule number one: never dress better than the hero. slap slap slap Here comes my sidekick, Slurp.
- CRASH!
- Hey, Slurp, maybe you should cut some eyeholes in your mask. Z
- Z
- Rats! I'm hungry. I always wake up in the middle of the night hungry. Oh well, let's look around.
- Hello, what's this? It feels like a big old loaf of pumpernickel.
- YIP! Sorry about that, Odie.
- All right! Olives! I love Olives! I like to suck the pimentos out first and then nibble on the green part till it's gone.
- SHUP
- I assume there's a logical explanation for this. CLICK I'm so embarrassed. Slurp, our mission in life is to seek out evil wherever it may lurk.
- LOOK!
- I'll bet there's some leftover evil in that refrigerator. Now that I have a sidekick, I can get into all sorts of trouble and he will protect me.
- Hey, dog, your mother chases garbage trucks. SMACK
- What do you mean, you resign your commission? The Caped Avenger sees a door that must be broken down.
- Slurp, take that door out!
- I love sidekicks. They do all the painful stuff. Come along, Slurp. Let's go fight for truth and justice.
- Look! There's a big dog beating up on a little dog! That's unjust! There's only one thing to do. BONK!
- We'll just fight for truth today. Oh no! My blanket's not here! How am I going to be the Caped Avenger today?
- Maybe Jon's got something.
- Somehow I don't think the ""Paisley Avenger"" is going to cut it. Pet Shop
- Look at all those poor animals in there all caged up. This looks like a job for...
- Freedom Fighter!
- YOU'RE FREE! YOU'RE FREE!
- GO FOR IT!
- Hmmm, folks must not be heavily into freedom these days.
- You're secure! You're secure! SLAM! Let's go to a movie tonight. Here's one about kids at a day-care center who save the world. It's been done.
- How about ""Ninja Grandmother""? You're getting warmer.
- Here it is! ""The Angry Mauve Planet"" Sounds like a contemporary remake. Well, guys, there's one thing we need before we go into the movie. SNACKS!
- I'd like the banana-flavored tooth busters, the flaming mouth things, the triple-buttered nut clusters and three pumpkin fizz sodas.
- That will be $89.50 Uh, how about some popcorn? With the barbecue sauce.
- I probably shouldn't ask this, but where did Odie get the bubble gum?
- PLOP! Don't ask, and don't look under the seats.
-
- Cut that out.
- Where are you going? The movie isn't over yet.
- The movie is over when the popcorn is finished. Why did we waste our evening at that movie?
- And why was the photography so bad?
- And why did they hand me three pairs of 3-D glasses? GARFIELD! IT'S TRIPLE-COUPON DAY AT THE SUPERMARKET. WE GOTTA HURRY!
- Here it is, triple-coupon day at the market. Shoppers are lined up and eagerly awaiting the opening of the store.
- There's the green flag!
- As the pack backs up behind the Butz Sisters, Thelda Balducci drops under the groove and passes inside.
- Balducci blows a tire and is f-boned by old lady Crowe!
- WE GOT THE SALES ITEM FIRST!!!
- Do you have any coupon? I forgot it. Rats! Black flagged on the last lap. Check the mail for me, will you, Garfield?
- POOMP!
- Anything for me? Just this package that came airmail. So, back again, huh? I thought you learned your lesson last time.
- THIS TIME YOU DIE!
- rrr I have some bad news, Garfield. I ran out of your favorite cat food. I'll survive.
- Odie chewed up your scratching post. Big deal.
- And Frank left Marcia for Stephanie. HOW COULD HE?! There's a mouse in the house. What are you going to do about it?
- Lighten up, Jon. How much can one little mouse eat?
- Can we talk? Nngh! Well, guys, it's time for the late night fright movie.
- Remember, Odie. It's your turn this week.
- Tell us when we can look again.
- plop
- What's the matter, Garfield? You got two left feet? The truth hurts.
-
-
-
- KISS
-
- I hate walking through tall weeds.
- I pick up bugs and stickers.
- And little dogs with sharp teeth
- rrr SNAP!
- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! *
- Static electricity is a wonderful thing. Hey, Odie.
- Do me a favor, will you.
- Thanks.
- GOOSH!
- Just as I thought. It's just eyeballs and a bow. Hey, dog, how about some pepper to go with that tail.
- WAH-CHOO!
- Gesundheit. Ouch
- SWISH SWISH
- There's something about carrying a stick that gives one a feeling of authority.
- Fiy my dinner! Get a haircut! Clean up that mess! poke
- Get some exercise! Make your bed! Lose weight!
- The bigger the stick, the greater the authority, huh? Well, two can play this game.
- Nngh! Your mother, puff puff, look both ways before...
- SQUASH
- I should have delegated some of this authority. Ooo, look at that stick! That isn't just any stick. That's a lucky special stick.
- Lucky special sticks run on imagination.
- This is one toy batteries won't help. Hey, Odie, where's your lucky special stick?
-
- Everyone needs a luck special stick.
- TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP Hey, Jon, my lucky special stick wants you to get up and fix my breakfast!
- A loyal friend, the lucky special stick. Dogs can't hurt me as long as I carry my lucky special stick.
-
- Of course, sometimes I have to carry it pretty fast. You're not going to believe this.
-
- When was the last time you saw a stick retrieve a dog? Nothing can harm me as long as I have my lucky special stick
- SNAP!
- They don't make lucky special sticks like they used to.
- I'm going to take a nap now, Nermal. If you so much as touch my food, I'll squash you flat, okay?
- KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
- Who are you? Don't you remember? I'm Nermal, the kitten you tried to starve a few years ago.
- I came back to replay old unkindness! WHAP! WHAP! POOF!
- Here you go, little buddy. Enjoy, enjoy!
- I must be dreaming. Garfield, you're sleeping your life away.
- There's a whole world out there for the taking.
- Great. Have it sent to my bed.
-
- Boy, am I bored. I'm so bored I have nothing better to do than lie here flat as a pancake.
- A big fluffy pancake dripping with butter and maple syrup.
- Boy, am I hungry. Jon, here's something I feel I should tell you, because you're going to find out anyway.
- You know how much Odie drools.
- I had to sandbag his tongue.
- There are hugs and there are hugs.
- But, there are no hugs like bear hugs. CLONK
- I hate that when the coaster sticks to my glass then falls onto the table!
- Garfield, cud I haff a wud wif you?
- Garfield, you watch too much television. Probably.
- You could be doing much better things with your time than staring at a TV set. That's for sure.
- There's a whole world out there to experience. I imagine so.
- Uh, you could be, ...uh, you could, uh.
- Why would someone wear a Llama suit? Bests me.
- What are we watching? Trivia Bingo. Surprise! I got you a canopy bed! Allright!
-
- I feel like a Sissy. YAWN
- WHA?!
- These canopy beds take some getting used to.
-
- Are you ashamed of your new bed, Garfield? What gives you that idea? Jon finally got me a bed with some class.
- But it's just not me. I have my pride.
- And pride, of course, is the middle class substitute for class.
- CLICK
- And just what are you doing? I had this incredible urge to take inventory.
-
- LIAR! It knows where I am.
- I know it's here. I can feel its presence.
- There's no escaping it.
- Once it has you, you're a goner!
- Run for it, Garfield!
- Here it comes again!
- YOU WON'T TAKE ME WITHOUT A FIGHT.
- ARRRGH!
- Another victim of a nap attack. Z Hello, I'm Nermal, the world's cutest kitten. Go away, Nermal.
- I'm taking a beauty nap.
- Beauty nap? That could take weeks! I hate him.
-
-
- Now I wonder what Nermal could be up to.
- THERE'S A SHARK IN MY WATER BOWL! Oh. Jump onto the pillow, Nermal!
- BLAT!
- You did that on purpose, did you? I do everything on purpose. You don't have to play with that pathetic little ball of yarn, Nermal, I'll get my personal ball of yarn for you.
- How nice!
- Maybe Garfield likes me after all! Answer me this...
- Why is it when they say an adult has the ""mind of a child,"" they lock him up?
- While children are allowed to run free in the streets?
- Well, well, well. Odie's sitting in front of the recliner. Let's have some fun, shall we?
- Watch this.
-
- WHUMP! WHAP!
- I hate to brag, but it took a brilliant mind to figure that gag out.
- SMACK!
- KLANG!
- Okay! Okay! You didn't have to shout. Let me tell you about my Monday. Monday was going great. I thought it was going to be the first Monday of my life that didn't stink.
- I got up in the middle of the night and ate some jawbreakers.
- Then I woke up this morning and my marble collection was missing! Hey, Garfield! I just bought a Swiss army knife. It does about a million things! Sure!
- I've seen those knives before. They're about as useless as...
- FOOMP! That's a new one on me. Jon, I have decided my living area is a mite drab.
- I have some plans to spiff it up a bit.
- What? No servant's quarters? Why, of course, silly! Right over there behind the pool. Z Gee, I wish we could get better reception on the television.
-
- Z Better. Garfield, begging for food is not going to get you anything to eat.
- Throwing a tantrum is not going to get you anything to eat. WAH!
- Now you're getting somewhere.
- Many of you have probably noticed you wake up in the morning a pound or two lighter then when you went to bed.
- Now, just where does all that weight go?
- I'm here to tell you that the atmosphere around us is filled with the fat of sleeping people!
- Furthermore, there are senders and there are receivers. We fat people gain weight simply by inhaling.
- Now, we sure as heck aren't going to stop breathing.
- So why don't you skinny people do a fat person a favor...stop sleeping. BONK! OUCH!
- WHANG! YOU STUPID APPLE TREE!
- Tink! I must learn to curb this temper of mine. My mom writes the greatest letters, Garfield. Listen to this...
-
- Don't spoil it for me, Jon. I'm waiting for the movie to come out. Garfield, I know you're hiding out there somewhere. Come on. Let's go to the vet!
- FUMP!
- AHA! I hate autumn. GOOSH
- You drink too much coffee, Garfield. Oh, yeah? Well, tell that to my nap.
- Maybe Jon was right... Garfield, you make a lovely fire. I do make a lovely fire.
- Well, I gotta get ready for my date. You enjoy your lovely fire. I'll enjoy my lovely fire.
- HEY! WHERE ARE ALL My BOW TIES?! They make a lovely fire. Most cat owners reflect the grace, style and poise of their cats.
- Most cat owners are informed, sensitive and intelligent.
- Bozo, the wonder nerd here, doesn't know what century it is. Z
- Z
- BREAKFAST TIME, GARFIELD!
- Ho, boy, I'm so tired my limbs feel like lead. It's going to be tough getting up this morning.
- Come on, Garfield! You can do it! Unngh! You can do it, boy!
- I MADE IT! I'M UP!
- Rats! I was only dreaming I got up.
- BREAKFAST TIME, GARFIELD! It had better be worth getting up twice for. Oh, very well, Garfield, you may have one bite of my spaghetti.
- twirl twirl twirl
- I don't give that cat enough credit. CAPTAIN! CAPTAIN! THERE'S A BLACK HOLE DEAD AHEAD!
- WE CAN'T TURN BACK! THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL IS TOO GREAT! ARRRRRRGH!
- They just went where no man has gone before. Which do you want, Garfield? The lasagna or the bananas?
- The bananas?
- We're talking play value here. I found a food that even you won't be able to play with, Garfield, tomato soup.
- SPLUT
- As long as I live, I'll never understand cats. Cats? What are cats? We soda crackers know nothing of cats. Garfield, the world famous tomato soup diver, scours the murky depths in search of the elusive tomato guppy.
- QUICK! GIMME THAT CAMERA!
- For the first time in history the spawning habits of the tomato guppy are captured on film. CLICK Wealthy philanthropist, J. Worthington III was found face down in his tomato soup.
- Was it natural causes?
- GARFIELD! Or was it because he was about to write J. Worthington IV out of his will? Hey, Garfield, did you ever wonder why they always have commercials at the good parts?
- I wonder if fish have taste buds.
- I hate it when Jon fishes. His mouth starts wandering.
- Where do the ripples in the water go?
- If people had fur all over their bodies, would they have to wear clothes?
- Why do light bulbs burn out?
- Am I boring you, Garfield? Hello, I'm RX-2, your talking scale. If you step on me, I'll tell you your weight.
- GET OFF! GET OFF! GET OFF! GET OFF!
- Whew! Thank you! Wise guy. How am I doing, RX-2?
- You know those two pounds you lost last week? Yes.
- They are back with reinforcements.
-
- You've gained weight, Garfield. I wonder how he knew me. How's my favorite talking scale? Are you ready to weigh me?
- Uh...I'll tell you what. What?
- What say we weigh one part at a time, and I'll give you a total. Very funny.
- You weigh 175 pounds and you are 6 feet tall.
- How do you know my height? I'm diversifying. Your weight is the same as yesterday, sir. Have a nice day.
- Talking scales. What will they think of next?
- What a lard ball. You're telling me? In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, honey. And people think cats do strange things.
- I'm in the mood for love *
- Well, Garfield, how do I look?
- You don't like it, huh?
- Maybe if I changed my tie and my pants and my...
- Now what do you think?
- Great! I'll see you later.
- People who have no minds of their own DESERVE to look like clowns. There's a nice thing about owning a cat. sniff
-
- CRASH! But I don't know what it is. Okay, talking scale, how much do I weigh?
- Do you mind if I ask a personal question first? Shoot.
- How many of you are there? Garfield, you eat food like it grows on trees. I wasn't born yesterday. I know the food fairy brings it in the night.
- What if the food just stopped? I could handle that.
- It's the eating I would miss.
-
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know this mailman was taken. That's quite all right. I know I haven't written yet, mom. I'm sorry. Yes, I'll come visit you when I can, okay?
- I FEEL LIKE SUCH a HEEL!
- Jon takes so many guilt trips, he qualifies for the frequent flyer plan. May I have your attention, please!
- Ladieees and gentlemen! Odie-The-Amazing will now dive into this glass of water!
- Of course he is going to need a little encouragement.
- Go for it, Odie! I'm going to make you a star!
- WHOAM! LET GO! LET GO!
- SPLUT! SPLOOT!
- When you own pets, there's never a dull moment. Grrrr! Great! It's here!
- Some people wear their emotions on their sleeves.
- I wear my opinions on my belly. I Hate Dogs I Hate Dogs
-
- Gee...I didn't think dogs could read. CUT THAT OUT, ODIE!
- How would you like it if I licked you?
- It just occurred to me. Someday I'm going to have to put this tongue back in my mouth. Hey, buddy. I'm a bathroom scale. So?
- So I don't do livestock.
- Me and my big voice chip.
-
- Odie must be getting something out of this wall I'm not.
-
- I don't believe I fell for that. MOTHER!!!
- What say we rest this lunch off in the park? Splendid idea.
- That was a great lunch. Boy, am I stuffed!
- Look at the size of this belly.
- Oh, yeah? Look at this!
- I'm fatter than you are. Check this out!
- You two are disgusting.
- It's no wonder we're still single, right, Garfield? Burp
- BURP BURP Ignore them, Melissa. Men are not a pretty sight. Why the long face, Garfield? I don't know.
- Are you depressed because you're fat and lazy and out of shape?
- Why is it friends aren't happy until they've given some direction to your depression? You look a little depressed, Garfield. Bingo.
- Just remember, when you're flat on your back, the only way to kook is up. Thank you, Jon. I am no longer depressed.
- Now I'm suicidal. I have some words of wisdom to help you beat those old blues, buddy.
- He's gonna get cryptic again.
- Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.
- Oh, great...I'm going to be up all night figuring that one out. I have you figured out, Garfield. You refuse to take life on because you're afraid of failure.
- That shows what Jon knows about human nature.
- Actually, I have a deep-seated fear of success. Garfield, your life is a big, fat drag. Do you know that?
- You sleep to escape. You eat to escape...
- You need more escapes. Boy, am I in a rotten mood.
- CRASH!
- This must be serious...that didn't even cheer me up.
-
- toing SPLAT!
- And now some carrots for color.
- Interesting. toing
- And just how long have you been sticking food to the ceiling?
- Oh, for quite some time now.
-
- Better. I'm housecleaning today, Garfield. So throw out all your useless stuff, okay?
- Okaaaaay.
- Garfield, may I have a word with you? Hey, Garfield! Come on in!
-
- How do you do that? Simple...fat floats. You may not know this, Garfield, but I'm somewhat of an expert at reading tea leaves.
- Ah, yes, it says here you will have a long and fruitful life. Your owner is kind and generous, and you will travel soon.
- Any questions? May I have my cocoa back? Garfield, do you want your eggs beaten? Yeah.
- And while you're at it, squeeze the orange juice.
- Then choke some toast And mangle the bacon! I'm worried about that boy. PURRRRRR, purr, purr.
-
- Actios speak louder than purrs. slurp!
-
- poo
-
- poo
- poo
- I spit out the hole. WHA?!
- Let me guess. It's time to trim the Christmas tree, right?
- You must be psychic. Come on, Odie. The sooner we go to bed, the sooner it will be Christmas morning. pat pat pat
- Christmas eve is the longest night of the year.
- I imagine it would be shorter if we could ever fall asleep. Merry Christmas, Garfield! Open your presents, buddy. What's the holdup? I'm just savoring the moment.
- This is my favorite morning of the whole year. All out differences are set aside and all the love we feel for one another is wrapped up in the gifts we have made with care. I love Christmas.
- Enough of sentiment. GIMME! What a great Christmas! Jon got me the perfect gift...food.
- Hey, Garfield, are you enjoying your present?
- I'd never seen a radio made to look like a hamburger! * Hey, Pooky, I need ahug.
-
- It's impossible to give a hug without getting one back. OH NO! I'M BEING HUGGED!
- How dare you hug an unarmed cat from behind! I feel...I feel, uh...I feel.
- Pretty good, actually.
- Do you boys wanna go out?
- Well, do you, huh?
- HUH? HUH? DO YUH? HUH? HUH?
- Open the darn door.
- The direct aprroach is the best approach. It's just about time...
- SPLUT!
- Yup, there's the 8:25 pie right on schedule. Well, if this isn't RX-2, the talking scale. How are you today, felly? I'm depressed.
- What could a scale possibly be depressed about?
- How would you like to be stepped on every day and called a liar?
- Good point. Do you wanna go out, boys?
- Do you? Huh? Huh? Do you?
- OKAY! GO FOR IT! Now we're too tired. What are you doing with those binopculars, Garfield? I'm checking something out.
- Yup...I was right.
- There's boredom just as far as the eye can see. Nobody takes me seriously
-
- Not even me! This is for you. Mail?! For me?! Wow! I'm important! I'm somebody.
- Hey, wait a minute! This is addressed to ""occupant""!
- Are you ready for lunch, ""occupant""? That's MISTER Occupant to you.
- Mornin', Garfield.
- Hello, little buddy, would you like a drink of wa-wa? Ha! Ha! I thought so!
- Jon talks to his fern more than he talks to me.
- EEEEK!
- Garfield, would you by any chance know what happened to my plant?
- Burp, if you have anything to say to your precious fern, just speak into my bellybutton. I feel great today! I feel like curing a major disease, writing a best-selling book and stopping poverty!
- LOOK OUT, WORLD! HERE COMES GARFIELD! Is there anything yu need, Garfield?
- Yes...I need you to stop me.
-
- How much do I weigh, RX-2? Do you really want to know?
- Not really.
- Would you like a hint? Let's see how much you know about cats.
- Here are two people who, for all practical purposes, appear to be identical.
- Guess which one is allergic to cats. I wonder if that floor is cold
-
- Yup...it's cold all right. I love hangig on the screen door. I can be a fly or a mountain climber... *
- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- Or a door knocker. *
- Scram! This is my birdbath!
- I hate to see birds have a good time.
- HEY! THIS WATER IS FREEZING!
- UNNNGH!
-
- Cats have an incredible innate ability to sense when you are not feeling well.
- Jon, I sense you are not feeling well.
- They also have anincredible innate lack of sympathy. Hands off, Garfield. I'm saving that for Odie.
-
- Nice try, guy. I'm going to give Garfield a little treat today.
- ARRRGH!
- You don't like shaved coconut? Shaved coconut, Yes. Albino spiders, no. Cats have an incredible innate ability to sense when you are feeling blue.
- Jon, I sense you are feeling blue. See?
- BONK! Cheer up! We hve here the last piece of cake, Garfield.
- I suggest we draw straws to see who gets it.
- I'm not a betting man. And now the world-class pancake flipper will demonstrate his skill.
-
- Pardon my ignorance, Mr. World-Class Pancake Flipper, but shouldn't the stove be turned on first? The mailman makes a great scratching post.
- We'll be right back after this announcement.
-
- Oooo! A warm spot.
- It's no sunbeam, but it will do.
-
- ROWRR!
- The first rule of owning a cat: ""Look before you sit"". GARFIELD'S Believe it, or DON'T!
- There is enough static electricity in 20 cats to start a car.
- But, it still won't start on a cold morning! Come on, guys. I'm late for work! Take a hike, jack. z z z z Believe it, or DON'T! GARFIELD'S Believe it, or DON'T!
- A Jon Arbuckle claims to own a cat who can eat 10 times its body weight. To verify his claim we offered the cat 270 pounds of lasagna.
- The cat ate only 219 pounds of lasagna. Things went so well in the rehearsal. Believe it, or DON'T! GARFIELD'S Believe it, or DON'T!
- Nick, a cat in Sweden, has eaten six mice a day for twelve years. That's over 26,000 mice!
- I spite of his notoriety, poor Nick is still single. Nick, about your breath... Believe it, or DON'T! GARFIELD'S Believe it, or DON'T!
- Cats and dogs evolved from a single animal called a ""cog"". It became extinct when it barked up the wrong tree... BARK! BARK! BARK!
- A tree named ""Bubba. Believe it, or DON'T! GARFIELD'S Believe it, or DON'T!
- In 1957, a cat in Oregon salved a drowning child.
- But, it was under the legal size limit, so he threw the kid back. Believe it, or DON'T! GARFIELD'S Believe it, or DON'T!
- A cat in Lubbock, Texas gave birth to 57 kittens.
- When asked how she felt after giving birth to quinseptulets, she said: I'll feel better when the start sleeping through the night. Believe it, or DON'T! This looks like my lucky day!
- Look at ol' Jon out there working his fingers to the bone planting a flower bed.
- I guess I'd better get out there and give those flowers the Garfield touch.
- I'll start by stomping on a few. Then I'll chew on a few. Then I'll yank the rest out by their tender roots.
- DIE, YOU DAISIES!
- BOING! BOING! BOING!
- How did you like my plastic flower garden? CHEATER! Sigh
- Gravity.
- Why fight it? It's fun to lie here and muse on the meaning of life,
- and muse on the myriad of solutions to the world's woes,
- and to count the cracks in the ceiling. People seem to be leading more active lifestyles these days.
- I wonder what that would be like?
- The only thing active about me is my imagination. You people don't appreciate the stress we cats must deal with.
- What with having hair all over our bodies...
- Living in constant fear of split ends. Some people have the silliest phobias.
- I have a fear of letting my mind wander.
- I'm afraid it wouldn't come back. I gotta start getting more out of life.
- I gotta smell the roses along the way.
- Hey, Garfield, is there anything I can do for you? Bring me a rose. In the news, today, cat season opens tomorrow!
- Z
- Snort, what's that sound?
- OH NO! I LEFt THE TELEVISION ON!
- On the all night movie channel!
- CLICK!
- CLUNK!
- I feel like such an unworthy parent! Z Hi, this is Jon Arbuckle. My cat needs a checkup...what kind of cat is he?
- Uh, he's a registered yellow tabby with distinguished lineage.
- Actually, he's an orange meatball with stripes. Hey, Garfield, let's get a pizza!
- SLAM! OH, NO! HA HA!
- On the way we'll stop at the vet. IT'S THE OLD BAIT-AND-SWITCH! I hate going to the vet.
- Actually, seeing the vet isn't so bad.
- It's the waiting room that depresses me. The doctor's not looking. Now's my chance to make an escape!
-
- Stupid stainless steel table! Hey, doc, do you mind if I have something to drink?
- Help yourself.
- There should be something in the refrigerator by the specimen bottles. While you're at it, doc, how about giving ME a checkup? Say ""Ahh"".
- Ahh.
- What was that? You'll neve rhave to worry about liver flukes again. Two coat hangers.
- Two coat hangers and an empty closet.
- There you go, kids.
-

-
- IT'S TRUE. Hey, dog, you're ugly! Hey, dog, you're stupid!
- Hey, dog, you couldn't catch a '532 Packard!
- ROWF! YIP! YAP! YAP! BARK! You gotta flip the right switch! Some people love to linger over dinner.
- ZOOM!
- Garfield makes cameo appearances. Do you know what I love about cats the most? It's our dignity. Even royalty could learn from the dignified style with which we conduct our lives.
- Well, I see by the old clock on the floor, it's lunch time.
- Time to beg for table scraps. My cat isn't perfect. He lies around a lot.
- In fact, I encourage him to lie around a lot.
- Because every time he moves, he destroys something. scratch scratch scratch scratch
- CRUNCH! ARRRGH!
- IF YOU DESTROY ONE MORE THING AROUND THIS HOUSE, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! You're too late. Sharpening claws can be risky business. scratch scratch scratch
- SPROING!
- Sometimes the furniture is booby trapped. Cat's cradle? I doubt it.
- World's LArgest Ball Of Twine
- World's largest ball of twine, huh?
- I wonder what this is for.
- Uh-oh!
-
-
-
- Don't worry, Garfield! I'll protect you from that fierce piece of string! I hate him. Ah, here comes Arlene.
- Hello, Garfield. Unnnngh Yugstyx.
- You may dispense with the vanity. Whew! Thank you. What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
- But this is a nice place.
- Like I said...what's a girl like you doing in a place like this? About that space between your front teeth, Arlene. Yes?
- When you smile, you look like a vending machine.
- Check that, a ""cute"" vending machine. Arlene, I'm sorry I picked on the space between your front teeth.
- Perhaps this little gift will make amends. What is it?
- A toothpick! * * * * *
- You dance like you have two left feet.
- I do. Oh, yeah. Why hasn't our relationship grown? Because you're a wise guy and I'm self-centered.
- But, Garfield, no man is an island.
- Or, in your case, a continent. My ego and I will get back on you. Z
- I wonder how Garfield would look in my gag glasses? Z
- And tie, and shorts, and tennies? Z
- Good morning, Garfield. snort...Morning.
- Hee hee What are you laughing at, pea-brain?
-
- Sometimes I wish I were awake when I'm asleep. I wonder what dog food tastes like? pant pant
- OH NO! MY EYES ARE DRYING OUT! MY TONGUE IS STARTING TO SWELL! I'M GETTING SHORT OF BREATH!
- PANT PANT PANT PANT PANT PANT
-
- I have more respect for food than that. Isn't rain wonderful, Garfield?
- When it stops, the earth is cleansed and the plants are refreshed.
- And I get to go out on the driveway and stomp on earthworms. Uh-oh!
- Jon should never leave his bunny slippers under the bed alone.
- Odie, you were a bad boy for chewing on the sofa.
- TAP TAP TAP
- Is this a private party, or can anyone play? WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- GLOP!
- The service here is slow, but at least the waiter is rude. Well this is another fine mess you've gotten me into.
- ** Oh, Garfield* Garfield's gon. The hogs ate him.
- Garfield, I have a big job for us today. I'm afraid I know what you're going to to do.
- I'm going to throw it out. But, it seems we just got it!
- There comes a time when everything must go. So soon?
- Let's get to it. Have you no heart?
- DON'T DO IT! DON't DO IT!
- It's starting to look a little tacky. I suppose you're right. Where are they?
- Hey, Garfield, have you seen my golf shoes? I'm wearing them.
- Are you quite through? Guess where we're going, Garfield? We're going to clown college.
- We're going to play golf. Let's go!
- Very funny. I've never been so ashamed in my life. WHIFF!
- Allow me.
- HOW COULD YOU?! YOU STUPID BALL! I'LL SHOW YOU!
- WHIRRR!
- I think you swing too hard. putt
- STOMP!
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?! You should thank me, you almost lost your ball down that hole. I wonder why Jon always takes me golfing?
- CRASH!
- Sorry about your window, sir. My cat is just picking up the game. Bingo.
-
-
- I'd better check this out.
-
- ARRRGH!
- What happened?! YOU TURNED MY WATER COLLECION LOOSE? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED! I think I'll write a book this week. They say everyone has a good book in them.
-
- I may have an entire library. In order to write a book I must go out and live life.
- I think I'll run with the bulls in Pamplona!
- Then I'll write a book entitled, ""The Stupidest Thing I've Ever Done"". We writers have an uncanny ability to observe ouselves from an omniscient point of view.
- ""As the handsome cat gazed upon the folly of life about him he tossed his head back in laughter... Ha! Ha! Ha!""
- And the he fell right off his chair. Some people only talk about writing books.
- And some people do something about it.
- Yes...yes, this is how I want to be photographed for the book jacket. Go ahead and eat, Jon, I'm a writer. I'll sit here and observe you.
-
- I think I'll write an autobiography. I must suffer in order to write a great novel.
- WHANG!
- Thank you, Jon. I'll remember you in my acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize for literature.
-
-
-
- I'm home! SLAM!
- CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! YIP! GARFIELD! Why is it I get blamed for everything around here?! Garfield, you prowl all night and you sleep all day. You also eat too much.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- You only go around nine times in life, so grab for all the gusto you can get. Garfield, it's time to put you on another diet. ARRRGH!
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT A DIET COULD DO TO ME?
- I could waste away to normal!
- The TV advertisers didn't waste any time.
- I've been on a diet one day and they're already running more food commercials. I gotta kick something. This diet is making me grumpy.
- tap
- Not to mention, weak. Garfield, I just want to tell you how proud I am of you. Jon, there's something I have to tell you.
- You've done a great job sticking with your diet this week. Listen to me, Jon.
- And that takes a lot of self-discipline. I ate your bunny slippers. You shouldn't watch sad movies when you're on a diet, Garfield. You know how emotional you get.
- This isnt a sad movie.
- It's a food commercial. SLURP! SLURP!
- SLURP!
- Uugh! This coffee is weak!
- What the? SLOSH
- Odie
-
-
- SLURP!
- Much better. Why is it I always have to go on diets?
- Oh, sure, I've put on pound or two...
- Or three or four or five. Here's your diet salad, Garfield.
- Would you like anything on it? If you don't mind.
- Perhaps you could garnish it with a chocolate cake.
- I think I know how Odie stays so slim.
- It must take a lot of energy to be that stupid. RRRRRR You have lost three pounds.
- Congratulations, Garfield! Thank, you.
- Pssst, when do I get my fresh batteries? Later. Garfield, in order to successfully diet, you must change your eating habits.
-
- SPLUT! On which days are most diets begun?
- Wrong. Monday is the second most popular day.
- Most diets begun ""tomorrow"".
- Hey, Jon. There's a spot on your shirt. Where?
- Ha! Ha!
- TOING!
- Hey, Odie, your shoelace is untied!
- Ha! Ha! TOIOIOIOIONG!
- Hey, Garfield! There's a huge, hairy spider crawling up your belly! Nice try, Jon!
- You gotta get up pretty early in the morning to pull one over on old Garfield.
- RATS!
- Rats?! Where? Oh, no! Whatever shall we do? There goes the neighborhood! Wiseguy rats. Who are you? We, sir are rats. We're all brothers.
- BONK!
- Oh, yeah, one of us is a sister. Howdy, stranger. Rip, Juanita and Bob are our names and spreading pestilence is our game.
- Which one of you is Juanita?
- The one with ""Eau de Vermin"" behind her ears. How did you rats get your names? I'm called Rip because I'm fast. Juanita was my grandmother's name.
- How about you, Bob? That's the sound my head makes when it runs into a wall.
- I take it Bob isn't very bright. He couldn't get through a maze with a map. Jon will kill me if he finds out I let rats into the house. I'll lure them out with the old ""Pied Piper"" ploy.
- *
- Okay, fat boy. Let's take it from the top. What do you guys want to do today? Let's spread pestilence!
- Nah, let's lower somebody's property value. Or take a scenic sewer tour.
- You're disgusting. It's a living. Or run up an old man's pant leg? Hello, Garfield. Hello, Arlene.
- I see you're still fat. I see you stil have that space between your teeth.
- At least I can close my mouth. I can go on a diet.
- You're not likely to go on a diet. You're not likely to close your mouth.
- Hey, why are we fighting like children? I'm sorry. I'm sorry too.
- So long, Arlene. So long, Garfield.
- Beaver face. Lard belly. I hate partly cloudy days.
- When it's sunny, I'm happy, when it's cloudy, I'm das.
- On a partly cloudy day I can use up a week's worth of moods. My, my. You're up early this morning.
- I didn't ge tup early.
- My leg cramp did! I hate it when I can't ge tmilk cartons open. Let me give you a hand.
- HIYAH! THOCK!
- Amazing things: claws. You stay out there, Garfield. I'll let you in when I'm good an ready.
- SCREEEEEEEE
- I'm ready. Good and. All tucked in for the night? Yup.
-
- MY LASAGNA! I was hoping you wouldn't notice. And now for the third tennis ball.
- TAH-DAH! A NEW WORLD'S RECORD. You spit those out very instant!
- Some people have no sense of history.
- Whoa! This is what I call a window of opportunity!
- No you don't, Odie! I saw it first!
- IT'S MINE! ALL MINE!
- Wait a minute, Odie. I have an idea! Why don't we COOPERATE to ge tthe pie? Then we will SHARE it!
- Sometimes the old axioms work best.
- Like ""there's a sucker born every minute"". Hey, Garfield, guess what? We are going to visit dad and mom on the farm again!
- Jon, you must be psychic.
- I was just lying here thinking it was time to restock the burrs in my fur. Hey, mom, pass the potatoes, please. Scalloped, whipped, fried, baked or boiled?
- Mom, you always fix too much food. I know, honey, I know. Now, what would you like?
- i can't decide. Just give me a piece of pie. Apple, peach, pumpkin, blueberry, cherry, or banana cream? Farm life's great, isn't it, Garfield?
- However, I will admit it's a little slow.
- Nothing much to do but count the bricks in the old silo. 14,238 Look, Garfield! A moo cow!
- And a bow-bow! And a piggy-piggy!
- Ha-ha, you guys! This must be the famous farm humor I've heard about. Kind of muddy today, isn't it, Garfield? It is.
- It's too deep for a little feller like you. I know.
- you oughta get up on Jon's shoulders. I am. It's cloudin' up. Yup.
- Looks like rain. Yup. These are men of few words.
- It's rainin'. Yup. And few brains. scritch scritch scrith
- SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH
- SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH BARK! BARK! Why don't you boys let yourselves out for a change?
- WHA?!
-
- CRASH
- It's time I give some serious consideration to adding a pet door. The newspaper should be here about now.
- BONK!
- Sometimes you get the paper, sometimes the paper gets you. My life is boring.
- Have you heard the old saying, ""all dressed up and no place to go""?
- I'm naked and no place to go. I gotta do something to spice up my life.
- I know! I'll take my afternoon nap in the morning and my morning nap in the afternoon.
- Garfield, you mad, impetuous boy, you. Life is like a Ferrari, it goes too fast.
- But that's okay.
- Because you can't afford it anyway. I shall now meditate in order to enrich my life.
- There is nothing like meditation to get in touch with on'e self.
- Self...if you don't get out of this stupid position in about three seconds, you kneecaps are going to fall off! Life is like a birdbath. It's made of concrete, filled with water, and uh...birds like to splash in it.
- Boy, that was dumb. Life isn't anything like a bird bath. tap tap
- Life...is like a sock monkey... Behind every sunday is a monday.
-
- Jon had better wake up on time this morning.
- If he oversleeps he's going to regret it.
- I fact, I kind of hope he does oversleep. We'll have some fun.
- blink blink blink
- I'M AWAKE! I'M AWAKE! PARTY POOPER! Hey, Odie, give me a push.
- A big push!
- Let's make that a MEDIUM big push. Get ready to go into orbit, Odie!
-
- Let me know when you get back! Look, Odie. No feet!
- Look, Odie. Only one hand!
- I hate showoffs. The green flag drops and the race is on!
- Leading the pack is the great Enzio Bodoni.
- Enzio Bodoni makes an unscheduled pit stop. Gee, I love playgrounds.
- I remember how much fun monkey bars were when I was a kid.
- I guess you can't go back. Odie, I need your help.
- Let's play on the teeter-totter.
- I could just cry. Z
- Z
- Wake up, Garfield. I want you to see a sunrise. A sunrise? Me? That's unnatural.
- It's about time you saw a sunrise. Then take a picture!
- Where's your sense of adventure? If it's before breakfast, I'm not interested.
- IT'S AN EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE YOU'LL NEVER FORGET! I know, I saw one once in a movie.
- I'll tell you what, if you got ot there peacefully, I'll never ask you to see a sunrise again. Agreed.
- Rats. I'm all choked up. Let's go in. Oops. CRASH! OH-NO! MY BEST CHINA!
- Look on the bright side, Jon.
- Your 64-piece set is now a 3,000-piece set. Garfield, there are cat hairs all over this place. Yes, isn't it wonderful? They are like family.
- Yuk! I almost swallowed this one! OH-NO!
- Billy? Speak to me! Are you all right?
- GARFIELD!
- WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY FERN?! I (burp) pruned it. Garfield, you act like you own this house. I do.
- What's this? A deed.
- This is a forgery! I'll see you in court. Wouldn't you know it? There's a cat hair in my lasagna.
-
- What do you have to say for yourself? Ouch!
- CRASH!
- What made you do that? My sense of aesthetics.
- OH-NO!
- ODIE! THANK GOODNESS IT'S YOU! THROW ME A VINE!
- GREAT!
- NOW PULL!
- Playing in your food again, I see. Playing heck! You oughta put warning signs around this oatmeal! Let's see what kind of day it is.
- ZIP!
- It appears to be a monday. I'll get you out of there, Garfield.
- WHIP! WHIP! WHIP!
- My hero. Odie! Odie! Pull the blind down, fella!
- WHIRRRRR!
- Our here. Well, I guess you guys can forget what I said yesterday.
- You know, about not doing enough together.
- OUCH! QUIT IT! OUCH! CUT THAT OUT! ROWR! RRRR! I wonder how we're going to get out of here?
- CRASH!
- Isn't that the way? Just when everything looks hopeless, things work out. I love happy endings. Excuse me, Ma'am?
- Would you mind doing me a big favor? YOU BEAST!
- What did I say? I don't think she wanted to get involved. I'm glad you could join me.
- You know, boys, it's nice to spend some quality time together and really visit.
- Remember the time you got wrapped up in the window blind, Garfield?
- And then I got caught in it trying to get you free?
- Then, to top it off, Odie got caught in it trying to save us!
- It seems like only yesrerday.
- It WAS yesterday, you twit! Urf. No you can't go out, Odie! Sir, would you help us out of this window blind? Sure.
- WHIRRRRR!
- The house isn't much, but we call it home. What's for dinner? STOP RIGHT THERE! I KNOW WEIRDOS WHEN I SEE THEM!
- WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP!
- Okay, you have me. Do with me what you will. Let's kill her. Shut up, Garfield. HELP! HELP! I'M BEING ABDUCTED.
- Okay, you dirty rats! Come out with your hands up!
- NEVER! WE'LL FIGHT TO THE LAST MAN! You stay out of this! I wonder how many more people are going to get trapped in this blind before this nightmare is over?
-
- Okay! Where did the lamppost come from?! I think Odie had something to do with it. It's hard to believe so many people can get caught in an ordinary window blind.
- How are we going to get out of this thing?
- And how are we going to get up? Hold tight, folks. snip snip
- You're free! YAYYYY!!
- This is great! It's nice to have some elbowroom. You can say that again! ROWR Tummies, they're never satisfied.
- For me, life is like a potato chip...I can't have just one.
- Life is like mashed potatoes...you gotta take the lumps with the good. SPLAT!
- Life is like a cherry phosphate...by the time you get to the good stuff, the fizz is gone.
- Life is like a turkey...any way you slice it, it's still a turkey. BONK! SPLASH!
- Life is like a fine cheese...it becomes more precious with age. sniff
- Life is like a rabbit...if it doesn't keep on hopping, it doesn't get anywhere.
- Looking for the ultimate meaning of life, Garfield? It's on this table somewhere. I'm bored.
- I think I'll take up a sport...
- SMACK! Tag! I'm it! GOOSH!
- Would you like a drink of water, Odie?
- I'd like to be able to stop each of those cars and aske the people where they're going. If they didn't have a good excuse I'd send them home.
- Of course, some of them may not have a home...how sad.
- ""Car people"". The birds seem to be singing more this time of year. chirp chirp tweet
- They may be heralding a change in seasons. * tweet
- Then again, it could be the shower Jon installed in the birdbath. * tweet * Hey, dog! I laugh at your looks! I spit on your feet!
- I like picking on the dog next door as long as there is a sturdy fence between us.
- Knotholes! I forgot about the knotholes! Here, Garfield,, have some shark's fin soup.
- Gee thanks, but, I'm not in the mood for seafood.
- I think I'll just have some of our chicken's foot soup. Viewers, do you suffer from intelligence?
- Good evening, this is Lance Sterling, your man on the street.
- Here comes someone down the street now...ma'am, which are smarter, cats or dogs?
- Why, cats, of course. SMACK!
- And what do you think, sir? I think dogs are smarter. POKE
- How about you, little boy? Pigs are smarter than cats or dogs.
- Pigs are smarter than we are? That's hard to accept.
- Come on, Odie. Let's go discuss this over a ham sandwich.
-
- Litter box backed up? I hate mondays. Yip! Yip! Yip! Let me help you, Odie.
- PLOOP!
- I don't know you dogs survive. Uh...Jon? Are you going to eat that hamburger, Pooky?
- I love eating with teddy bears.
- They're always stuffed.
- GARFIELD! DIN... ZIP! GULP!
- Urp...what's on TV? COME BACK HERE AND LINGER! tappity tappity tappity
- I knew a dog who was so stupid, he chased bones and buried cars!
- CLONK! BOP! BAP! BONK! I knew a dog who was so rich, he hired someone to drool for him!
- HA! HA! HA! HA!
- I hate to laugh at my own jokes.
- Hold the diving board steady, Odie.
- Okay, let's give it a try!
- Out of the way, mutt! I'll be the first to try this swimming pool.
-
- Maybe we should check the assembly instructions again. scrittch scritch
- You sure spend a lot of time in the sunbeam, Garfield. Haven't you heard?
- Cats are solar powered. Hello there, I'm Nermal, the world's cutest kitten. I know I know.
- There's something more important then being cute you know. Whatever could that be?
- Being big. YEE-HA!
- That looks like fun. Let me try that.
- What's the problem here? It's a mystery to me. A little to the right. SCRITCH
- Oh, yeh! That's it! SCRITCH SCRITCH
- Now I see why people love cats. We're pretty terrific all right. What a great day! I feel like conquering the world today. Fat chance, kid. You're suffering from the idealism of youth.
- Has it occured to you that you may be suffering from the cynicm of old age?
- Okay, first we conquer the block, then the neighborhood, then... Hey! Quit leaning on me. I am not leaning on you.
- PLOP
- See? The wind shifted, that's all. UGH! LEFTOVERS!
-
- COME AND GET IT; GARFIELD!
-
- DINNER IS SERVERD!
-
- Got the hankering for something a cat can really dig into? The try the cat food with with real meat by-products and rare herbs and spices. Then, quench that all with a tall frosty bowl of milk.
- Happy? We cats appreciate good packaging. Good heavens! I'm going to be eight years old this thursday!
- I hate birthdays. They're a lot like calendars.
- They remind you your days are numbered. Hey! There's somebody in bed with me!
- Oh, it's you...
- Good morning, belly. I have some bad news about your birthday cake, Garfield.
- It collapsed under the weight of the candles. Is that an age joke?
- Oh well, it would probably have set off the smoke alarm anyway. TIME-OUT! UNFAIR! AGE JOKE! Happy birthday, Garfield! We love you!
- Do you know the best part of birthdays?
- For a day, it's nice to have the world revolve around you! Happy birthday, Garfield. Here's a double-chocolate fudge marshmallow cream cake!
- And here's chocolate chip ice cream, sugar cookie and a cherry phosphate! Any queszions? Yeh...
- What's for dessert? For your birthday I got you a diet book. Gee, thanks! This is perfect!
- Diet
- Cookies Are you the bologna or the pimento loaf?
- GROWL
- Rats, I'm hungry for something and I don't know what it is.
- I don't want lasagna. I don't want milk. I don't want hamburgers.
- A craving usually denotes a deficiancy in the system.
- THAT'S IT!
-
- The mailman content of my blood was getting low. Will that be all? Irma, we haven't ordered yet.
- Here's your check. Have a nice day.
- Don't you care that we haven't eaten? Not as long as you leave a nice tip. What do you recommend, Irma?
- The hamburger flambe, french fries flambe, chili soup flambe, and peach pie flambe.
- What's with all the flambes? The kitchen is on fire. What'll you have, Jon?
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Suit yourself. How's it going, Irma? Great! Just won the fast-food service division of the waitress awards.
- What's the fast-food service award?
- BLAT! BLAT! Here you go, fellas. The ""Saturday Special"".
- This stuff tastes terrible!
- Well, to be honest, it's the ""Week-Ago-Saturday Special"". Irma, I ordered a pie a la mode. Where's the scoop ice cream? It was there a minute ago.
- WAH-HA!
- I GOT IT! I'll hav ethe pie plain, thank you. You have a heart of stone, my dear.
- Come on, guys. We have some shopping to do. Can't you see I'm meditating right now?
- This lawn ornament is perfect for mom. How long have you hated your mother?
- I think I'll grab a little nap while Jon shops.
- Oh, Freeman! Look at that plaster cat! Z
- Yawn! What a nice nap?
-
- Why is it all the rotten luck happens to me? Whine!
- Oh, what are you complaining about? Why, hello there, little spider.
- Here, make yourself at home. Share my food, my bed...
- My library. WHUMP! Okay, Odie, today we scare the mailman...look vicious!
-
- All right, let's practice slobbering on his shoes. Here comes the mailman. Now's my chance to shred his pant legs.
- YOW!
- Sorry, pal. I didn't notice you were wearing bermuda shorts. I hate it when I lose Garfield in the department store.
- GARFIELD! WHERE ARE YOU? Over here.
- House Plants By the...burp...salad bar. Normally I'd destroy Odie for this, but, luckily for him, I've had a change of heart.
- PUNT!
- Of course, it eill take a while for word to reach my foot. Good morning, Odie.
-
- How can you communicate with a dog whose brain didn't leave a forwarding address? Hold still, Odie. We'll get it open this time.
-
- Here's some change, Garfield. Get us some pop.
-
- CHUKONG!
- I wonder what would happen if I put all the money in at once. CLINK CLINK
-
- CAJUNG! What a night! I dreamed the house was surrounded by a pack of vicious dogs chanting, ""Send out the cat! Send out the cat!""
- Good morning, Garfield. Would you like to go out?
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON MY SIDE! Or would you rather stay in? OH, NO! JON'! FOAMING AT THE MOUTH!
- QUICK! LET'S MAKE A BREAK FOR IT!
- Good morning, boys. TOO LATE! LET'S SPLIT UP AND HOPE HE GOES AFTER YOU! That, son, is a cat.
- He's a fat one and ugly, as cats go.
- I may have to break our treaty agreement. Notice the sloping, criminal forehead. I can't understand it, Garfield, Why don't I have better luck with women?
- Excuse me, Do you have the time? Only the rest of my life, you radiant thing you!
- Perhaps you're a bit too eager. RRRRR
- CLICK
- Playing with the hair dryer, Garfield? I'm going for the natural look. Garfield, if you keep eating like that, you're going to explode.
- POW!
- Okay! Who shook the soda pop? Never tell a hungry cat the dinner is ALMOST ready.
- Something smells good. What is it?
- I'm going to bake a lasagna, Garfield, Do you wanna help? Let me think about it for a min...sure!
- First we'll brown the hamburger with the tomato sauce and seasonings. I'd better see if this's fresh.
- Then we'll scoop the ricota, slice the mozzarella and grate the parmesan. I'd better see if this stuff's NOT fresh.
- Next, we'll lay a bed of noodles in the pan. One for me, one for the lasagna, one for me...
- And no we'll bake it for one hour at 3750.
- TIME PASSES
- Gee, that recipe didn't make much lasagna. It apparently didn't take sampling into account. THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT!
- IT'S GONNA GEt ME!
- AHCHOO! Sniff. I'm allergic to something around here. I wonder if it's dogs?
- SNIFF!
- Nope. Ah, AH
- AH, AHH!
- CHOOO! Sniff.
- SNIFF
- SNUCK! Yes, Garfield. I know you're not feeling well. I'M GONNA SNEEZE! AH-AHH AHHH!
- fft
- Thank you. Where are you going? I'm going to boil my finger now. This is what's been making me sneeze! It's Jon's cologne.
- It's called ""Ditchdigger, The Working Man's Cologne"".
- And, as you know, I'm allergic to work. All right, who brought in the fleas. scritch scritch scritch
- Sigh.
- I'm bored. There's gotta be something to do.
- Pets always seem to be able to entertein themselves. Maybe I could do what they do.
- So...played with any good yarn lately?
- I got it! I got it!
-
- Call the Funny Farm, Reba! Arbuckle's finally gone off the deep end! rowr Yip! Yip! Bark! Bark! YAWN
-
- Mondays are losing their subtlety. Monday 21
- RIP Monday 22
- OH, NO! IT'S THE MONDAY THAT WOULDN'T DIE! Monday 23 You're right, Garfield. Every day this week is monday.
- I'm sure it's just a misprint. It doesn't mean anything.
- Then again. GONK! I'd better check to see if it's still monday out there.
-
- SPLUT! Yup. Imagine having to suffer an entire week of mondays. Well, they're not getting me!
- I'm spending the rest of the week in bed.
- You gotta get up pretty early to put one over on old Garfield.
- It must be wonderful to be that stupid.
- For Odie, every day is saturday. HERE, KITTY, KITTY.
- Uh-oh.
- Hello, kitty. Would you like to come to my house? Take a hike, kid.
- I'll fix you lots of good things to eat. I'm with you!
- We'll have such a splendid time!
- And you can play with Muffin, too.
- Here you go, Muffin. How's your coffee this morning, Garfield? A little weak.
- THUD!
- See? It didn't even crack the plate.
- gobble munch smack slurp
- Burp Don't eat this pie, Garfield. I won't.
- You won't forget will you? I won't forget. I never forget.
- I just have convenient lapses of memory. Sorry, boys. I just ran out of coffee. WHAT?!
- Wait! You're in luck. I just remembered...
- The last guy in here spilled his. I think I'm going to be sick. This is great. What did mom used to say about sleeping in laundry baskets?
-
- Ah, yes...""My son, sleep only in the clean laundry"". This mirror should shame Garfield into losing some weight.
-
- Why, thank you for the charming and witty dinner companion, Jon. You can't shame a shameless cat. FROM DEEP WITHIN GARFIELD'S WORST FEARS IT...*CAME*!
- SEE! THE MONDA yTHAT WOULDN'T DIE! Z
- See! The attack of the incredible Slobber Monster!
- See! The interminable visit of the cutest kitten on earth! ARRRGH!
- See! The can opener that wouldn't work! UNNGH! toink toink toink
- Wake up, Garfield. Wanna go to a movie? It's not violent, is it?
- It's called ""Slime Pit Zombie Chain Saw Massacre"". As long as there are no mondays in it. Are you ready for this, Garfield?
- TAH-DAH ARRGH!
- Are you all right? Next time warn me before you get ready to play golf? Do you know what these are, Garfield. Yes, I do.
- And do you know what they're for? Of course.
- I know doggie whackers when I see them. I'm going golfing, Garfield. Would you be my caddy? No way! I'm nobody's slave.
- That's okay. I have somebody else in mind anyway.
- Hello, caddy.
- We're all doomed! Take my clubs, caddy!
- Oops. HAR! HAR! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?
- This is surely breaking some pet labor law. Fetch the ball, caddy.
- ODIE!
- Let's talk. Here comes the gounds keeper, and, yes, I believe he's carrying a gun. Bring my bag, caddy.
- OH-NO!
- WHERE ARE MY CLUBS?! Back where I decided to lighten the load. Ready...aim.

- It's starting to keep me awake.
- I must have tossed and turned for three minutes last night. SLUCK
- DONK!
- Nothing spoils lunch any quicker than a rogue meatball rampaging through your spaghetti. Hey, Garfield. Come here.
- I'm sleeping with my socks on tonight.
- Hee hee Har! Har! Life is a gas when you live with a crazy man like Jon! PANT PANT PANT

- BONK!
- Then again, there's something to be said for barbed wire. Oh, no! Mice have gotten into the cereal.
- That settles it! It's time to take action!
- WE GOTTA GET A CAT! GARFIELD! THERE'S A RAT IN THE CELLAR! So?
- So I want you to catch him.
- Then what am I supposed to do? Make a citizen's arrest? You're hopeless. You know that don't you? What are we going to do about the rat in the cellar? I KNOW!
-
- What are you doing? We'll poison him. Why do *I* have to catch the rat? They're mean, with large pointy teeth.
- Hold on, boy. Remember you're a cat. A fierce, carnivorous, predarory animal.
- THe KING OF THE JUNGLE! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Did you get the rat, Garfield? You know, Jon, people should talk more.
- The rat...did you catch the rat? All things can be worked out if you just use reason.
- What happened? I gave him territory. Oh, great.
- I hate spiders.
- WHAP! Aack!
- cough cough wheeze
- daddy! speak to me! your father is dead, son. I'm a widow now.
- I guess I should feel like a heel.
- But, I don't. WHAP! Aack! Aack! Go get the paper, Garfield. Work! Work! Work! That's all I do around here.
- I wonder what would happen if I just kept right on walking?
- I guess I'm going to find out. Odie, it's been 10 minutes since I sent Garfield after the paper. Go find him.
-
- Why do I feel like I just sent the lamb after the lion? Gee, I sure miss the boys.
- WHAT'S THAT?!
- Oh yeah...that's quiet. GARFIELD! ODIE?! WHERE ARE YOU?
- HA-HA, GUYS. THE JOKE'S OVER. NOE COME BACK HERE!
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! Call the wagon, Reba! that's not a natural laugh! Well, here I am on my own.

- The NExt Day... Ah! There's my ad. Jon boy, you thought of everything.
- DING DONG I wonder who that could be?
- Who, Simba! Er I mean, Odie. I found Garfield and Odie, mither. Maybe I should have been more specific. I don't know why I should be so upset over Garfield and Odie leaving. It's not like they're family or anything.
- It's 10:00. Do you know where your children are?
- WAH! Gee, I'm lonely. I feel like it's just me against the world.
- GROWL
- Okay, okay...US agains the rest of the world. I'm so tired I hurt.
- I could sleep for a week.
- If I were't staring at this special for ground beef at Ed's Market. I'm homesick. I think I'll use my natural, uncanny sense of direction to find my way home.
-
- If I can find my way out of this newspaper. ODIE! YOU SLY DOG! THERE YOU ARE!
-
- Odie must have a very popular ear style. The milkman cometh.
- Now to wait for the doughnut man.
- Hello, doggie, are you lost?
-
- Would you like to come home with me?
- Hmmm
- And how would you like those silly ears of yours tied in a square knot?
- I thought so. Mommy! Look at the doggie I found. May I heep him?
- He's not rabid or anything, is he? Oh, no! He's not rabid!
- He's just stupid. Would you like to give Dollie a kiss, doggie?
- SLURP! How sweet!
- DOLLY! WHERE DID YOUR FACE GO?! Oh, doggie. I love you and I hug you and I squeeze you! I could hold you forever!
- Good night, doggie!
- GASP! Sniff
- Oh, poor doggie. I'll bet you miss your home, don't you? I'll bet you'd like to go back to your owner, wouldn't you?
- OVER MY DEAd BODY! Okay, doggie, let's pretend you're at a tea party with all your little friends.
- Now let's pretend...
- IT'S OVERRUN BY MERCENARY GUERILLAS! Good night, little doggie. You sure do love it here, don't you?
- Doggie?
- Mom! Call out the dogs! Another one's gone over the wall! If you are here you are lost!
-
- Uh-oh! Look, fellas, a cat chew-toy.
- ARF! ARF! Wait a minute. He braks like a dog.
- PANT! PANT! PANT! And he pants like a dog.
- Cool it, guys! Here comes the dogcatcher! BARK! BARK!
- purrr scratch scratch meyow There's no justice. It's getting hungry out here. I hate to admit it, but I'd better find work. But, what can I do?
- BINGO!
- I Want You Join The Circus Show business, here I come! I'm going to join the circus!
- I think I'll be a trapeze artist of a lion tamer.
- Or a clown. Listen up, cat. I'm Binky The Clown. I'm the head clown around here and don't you forget it! It's a little hard to ignore.
- And respect...I demand respect.
- When I honk my nose, people snap to attention. He's full bore looney all right. This is a slapstick. It makes a lod noise, but, it doesn't really hurt.
- Go ahead. Hit me with it as hard as you can. With pleasure! WHAP!
- It's all in the wrist. LADIEES AND GENTLEMEN! MY ASSISTANT!... ROTUNDO THE CLOWN! ""Rotundo""?
- ROTUNDO WILL NOW TAKE A PIE IN THE FACE! SPLUT!
- FROM MY ASSISTANT; DUMMY THE CLOWN! He looks vaguely familiar. This life isn't for me. Are you coming with me, clown? ploop
- ODIE!
- Hey! We ran away from home to run away from the circus! Table for two?
- Boy, am I hungry.
- If we don't find something to eat soon, Odie, we are going to starve.
- LOOK! AN ANTHILL!
- In parts of the world where food is scarce, natives squat by the anthills...
- As the ants come out they pinch their tiny heads and put them in a pile until there's enough for a meal!
- Bon appetit, Odie. You enjoy yourself.
- While I squat by the door of this butcher shop. You boys look like you need a good meal. We're starved!
- Well come in. Eat! Eat! There you go, Odie.
- PET SHOP There ARE some good-hearted people in this old world. Hi, gang. What is this? Some kind of party? No, it's some kind of pet shop. CLANG!
- You were lured in here with food. Now you're trapped. There's nothing to do here but eat and sleep.
- Sounds like a little slice of heaven to me. you have a very brave friend here. This pet shop life isn't so bad. It's kind of like camp.
- Oh, it has drawbacks, believe me. Name one.
- You bunk with the lizard. I'm getting the drift. I tell you, friend, living in a pet shop is dehumanizing. There's no privacy. The overcrowded conditions are deplorable. Amen.
- Here's the ship ment of mice, Mrs. Ernsberger. Where do you want them?
- PUT 'EM IN HERE! WE'LL TAKE'M! WE CAN MAKE ROOM! GARFIELD! ODIE! JON! The cat and dog are $25 for the pair.
-
- I'll give you 20. You're going to regret that one, Jon. What a surprise to find you guys in a pet shop!
- I would have never thought to look there. Then what were you?...
- Forget it I'd rather not know. Home's where you can scratch where it itches.
- HOME!
- It's great to be home! Home is truly where the heart is!
- I even love the little imperfections that give it personality...
- This little squeaky place in the floor. SQUIK SQUIK
- The dripping faucets, the peeling wallpaper.
- The cracking paint, leaking roof...termintes,...dry rot...
- This place is a dump! Whew! Boy is my breath bad this morning.
- It must have been that sandwich I ate before bed last night.
- Or possibly that block of goat cheese. I gotta find something for this bad breath.
- Aha!
- Your breath smells funny. Yours would too if you gargled with after-shave. There's all kind of neat stuff in here.
- Deodorant. I know what this is for.
- sssssss BZZZZ
- CLICK
- PLaying with my electric razor, Garfield? Never mind. GARFIELD!
- YOU'RE USING MY TOOTHBRUSH! Stick around. You can watch me floss.
- IS NOTHIG SACRED?! Where's that mouthwash? Rats, what happened to the maple syrup?
- Now I remember...the syrup bottle sprang a leak.
- So I poured it in Jon's hair tonic bottle. Oh, Garfield? Get your face outta my place.
- You're going to exercise today, Garfield. NO!
- YOU'RE GOING TO EXERCISE, OR ELSE! IT'S A FREE COUNTRY! I'M FREE TO Be OUT OF SHAPE!
- We're going jogging! NO!
- We're playing tennis! NO! BONK!
- We're doing push-ups! NO! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP!
- OKAY! YOU WIN! An empty victory, But a victory none the less.
-
- THUD This has possibilities.
-
- Drive-thru restaurants are so convenient.
-
-
- BLAM!
- Gimme that!
- I have plans for this radio controlled tank.
- We'll take no prisoners. How cute, a toy tank.
- BLAM!
- Sorry about that. But, we had reason to believe your tuna casserole was leaking troop movement information to the enemy. I'm going to get Garfield to jog with me today by attacking his pride.
- Hey, Garfield, I was going to challenge you to a race, but I decided not to humiliate you. You're too fat and out of shape to outrun a garden slug.
- OH YEAH?! YOU'RE ON! My psychology is working!
- GET ON YOUR MARK! GET SET!
- G=! SLAM!
- CLICK
- There is never a need to outrun anything you can outwit. Z
- CRASH! DONK! WHAP!
- The monday paper.
- Why, hello, Garfield. Where have you been all day? purrr
- Under your car. STOMP!
- PUSH
- POOMP! Garfield! You're not going to believe this! I was in a bakery today buying a cake when three midgets in gorilla costumes raced in, se tthe place on fire and ran out with the cash register! Wow!
- Come on, Jon, Don't spare the details!
- Chocolate or vanilla frosting? Today I will demonstrate ""deep-knee-kricks"".
- This is one I'm sure just about all of you can do.
- KRICK KRICK sigh
- Anybody can exercise...
- But this kind of lethargy takes REAL discipline.
- SLUUUCK
-
-
-
- SPLOOSH!
- I assume there's a reason for this. I'd like to get your assessment of the possibility of blueberry pancakes for breakfast. I'm ready this time.
- Come on, monday, do your worst.
- Garfield, we're going to see the vet today. Arrrghh! Tell me something, doc.
- Why is it every time I bring a hoseplant home, Garfield eats it?
- Given the shape he's in, it's one of the few things in his diet that can't outrun him. She's a funny lady. Give me one good reason why you won't go out with me, doc.
- You're obnoxious, pushy, wishy-washy, slow-witted and boring.
- Oh yeah? Well give me a second reason. Just what would I have to do to get you to go out with me, doc?
- Stand on your head and scream like a chicken, for starters.
- BUCK-BUCK-BUC-KAW! Dignity is not in this man's vocabulary. Look, Jon. My boyfriend wouldn't like it if he knew you were trying to ask me out. Oh, yeah? What's his name.
- Nick ""The Mangler"" Scarlotti. Oooo! I'm impressed!
- I AM impressed. How old is your cat, Mr. Arbuckle?
- He's eight. Really? He doesn't look that old.
- He shouldn't. He's only been awake for about two of those years. Is it any wonder I hate him? Oh oh! Jon has that ""we're going to the vet"" look.
- I'm glad I don't have to get a dog shot.
- I only have to get a little kitty shot, but you have to get a dog shot.
- The dog shot needles are this long and real thick.
- NEXT!
- Okay, let's do the dog shot first.
- There, that wasn't bad, was it?
- Now for the kitty shot. Inside, I'm screaming. Sigh.
- I don't think I could bear to see Odie pushed off the table today.
- Therefore... push And now a word from our sponsor.
- We guarantee in writing that, if you buy our products, we will make mor emoney than you do.
- Refreshingly direct. Let's see...we have everything for the beach except a beach ball.
- HEY, GARFIELD! BRING SOMETHING WE CAN KICK AROUND IN THE SURF!
- Without even looking around, I know I should have rephrased that. Make yourself useful, Garfield. Here's an air mattress and an instruction sheet.
- Unroll and lay flat. I can handle that.
-
- Remember, Garfield, there is no greater failing than apathy.
- So what? Garfield, you're a pearl. Why, thank you, Jon.
- And do you know how pearls are formed in oysters? Howzat?
- THROUGH CONSTANT IRRITATION! Jon must not be happy with me. No fern is too tough for the Caped Avenger (urp!)
- Steady, boy. Steady.
- Okay, Odie. Let's ee if you're worthy of being the Caped Avenger's high performance mode of transportation!
- FASTER!
- FASTER!
- ZIP! STOP!
- Seat belt...the Caped Avenger needs a seat belt. GO! GO! GO!
- Garfield, that monster shark just ate Tokyo. Why are you cheering for it?
- Anything that eats everything can't be all bad.
- And what are YOU supposed to be?
- Anothe rhapless bather falls prey to the tiger shark. The cunning tiger shark, the world's most efficient eating machine with the world's most vocarious appetite, spies a helpless feast!
- FEEDINF FRENZY!
- ptoo! Yuck! Anchovies! I suppose you think you look like a shark. You got it, buster.
- Well you don't look anything like a shark! Oh, yeah?
- Well just wait until my fin comes back from the cleaners!
- CHOMP MUNCH GULP
- Just when you thought it was safe to have breakfast... As the shark approaches his prey, he senses something amiss.
- Oh, yeah, water! Sharks need water!
- Happy people must know something we don't.
- What's this?
- Why, thank you, Garfield.
- DOG FOOD! QUICK! GIMME SOMETHING TO DRINK!
- HOT SAUCE! I'M BURNING UP!
- GLUG GLUG GLUG
- GOLDFISH WATER! ANTIDOTE! ANTIDOTE!
- AARRGH! ANCHOVIES!! This could go on for days. Self-indulgence.
- There's a message in those great words.
- If you don't indulge yourself...nobody will.
- POOMP!
- Business lunch. Hey, Garfield, do you know what time it is? Lunch time?
- It's time for fun with static electricity!
- The man is a laugh riot. Bus Stop Here it comes.
- It's slowing down! Jon, you're so insecure.
- Look at that, Garfield! A whole bus stopped just for me! You're a heavyweight, all right.
- ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! I'LL GET YOUR BREAKFAST!
- sob sob Cracked like an egg. Garfield, why can't you catch mice like other cats?
-
- Sorry. I always like to give him a second to retract his stupid statements before I hurt him. AROOOO!
- AROOOO
- AROOOOoooooo Odie needs something to occupy his time.
- This television should shut him up. AROO
- AROOO*
-
- Good morning, Garfield.
- Z
- I hate monday morning pep talks. Z AHA! GOTCHA!
- It's time for your flea spray. Now don't give me any trouble. Just sit there.
- PSSSSSSs That's my boy. Okay, mouse! I know you're behind that box! Come out with your hands up!
-
- GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! scratch scratch scratch
-
- Your chair has an itch. Z
- This looks like a nice place... Z
- for a nap. Z Look, Garfield. I got you a water bed!
- Water beds are all the rage, right? You always wanted a water bed, right? Right.
- But a hot water bottle in a box? Odie, come here, boy. I have a wet surprise for you.
-
- KNOCK KNOCK
- OH, NO! WET PETS!
- MY CHAIR!
- GET OFF! GET OFF! GET OFF!
- ARRRRGH!
- Sob. There's a proud man, Odie. He won't let us see him cry. You think too much about food, Garfield. You need a distraction.
- Try reading a book. Novel idea.
- COOK BOOK I have a special surprise for you today, Garfield!
- Generic cat food.
- Then feed it to a generic cat! toing SPLAT! You know, Garfield, you should really be thankful for the food you eat.
- I am, Jon. I am.
- I'm also thankful for the food you eat. Isn't life great, Garfield? We should count our blessings.
- ZIP!
- Whew! They're all there! Garfield, did you eat my jelly fille ddoughnut?
- It was like this, Jon. It happened to be a rogue doughnut wounded in a jungle bakery.
- Crazed with fear and pain, it charged my mouth and I was forced to eat it in self-defense. It's times like this I wish I understood him. I'M HOME!
- Hi, Garfield. You're so nice to come home to! NUTS! STUCK AGAIN!
- HEY, GARFIELD, DINNER!
- SCREEE
- GULP
- Garfield, you can't still be hungry.
- You have to lose weight. No mor efood until breakfast.
- Do you really want that, Jon? Do you know what happens to skinny people?
- THEY BECOME MIMES, JON. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!! A MIME?! I think I'll take a short nap.
- Hee hee hee.
- Whoever heard of a tall nap? If the early bird gets the worm, then the early cat should get the bird.
- So I'll just step outside and get an...
- EARLY DOG! YAWN
- smack smack smack
- I wish Jon would warn me before he turns the firnace on.
- Some people lose weight.
- I just give it a temporary leave of absence.
- Odie isn't exactly the brightest dog around.
- His I-Q

- MEOW!

- Hey, Garfield, I've decided to throw a party.
- I'll invite all of my friends.
- I'd better start making plans. ...and friends. Hello, Liz? This is Jon Arbuckle.
- I'm throwing a little party this weekend and I...excuse me?
- Do you mean that literally or figuratively? Literally has my vote. Well, Garfield, what do you think of my party outfit? I like it.
- It makes a statement.
- And that statement is, ""I'm a nerd"". You're going to look great for the party.
- Hey, Garfield, what do you think of Odie's costume?
- It's just screaming for accessories. It's 9:30 and nobody's shown up for my party. What do we do now?
-
- Okay, food, my tongue's leaving town in 15 minutes. Be on it! I can't understand why no one came to my perty. Surely they got the invitations.
- I told Odie to take them to the mailbox 3 days ago.
- But did you tell him to put tehm IN the mailbox? Garfield, don't eat this food. It's for my party.
-
- Okay, Odie. Take these party invitations and put them in the mailbox.
-
-
- Come on, Garfield. The social event of the season has arrived. DING DONG
- I was expecting the upper crust. And you got the crumbs. Good morning, Pooky.
- Teddy bears are great to sleep with.
- No morning breath.
- SQUEEZE
- HA, HA, HA! YOU SQUEEZED POOKY TOO HARD HUH? THAT's HYSTERICAL!
- SQUEEZE
-
- SQUEEZE
- ARRRGH! Good news, Garfield.
- I completely restuffed Pooky for you.
- You know, with Pooky overstuffed like that, you two make a good match.
- Like father, like son, eh?
- Sign here, mister.
- Hey, Garfield. I got an aluminium tree this year. No more mess. No more tradition.
- And for splash and dash, it turns in an electric stand! Is nothing sacred?
- If it's splash and dash Jon wants, this blender would make a keen tree stand.
- Ready for me to plug the tree in, Garfield? Give me a head start!
- WHIRRRR ARRRRGH! HEY, JON! WANT MORE DASH? TRY LIQUEFY! Get out of my way, Odie. I'm trying to wrap presents.
-
- Good evening, folks. I'd like to start by signing a few Christmas carols!
- SPLUT! BLAT! SPLAT!
- Critics don't even take the holidays off. Well, the gifts are under the tree and the food is prepared. There's only one more order of business...
- I just want to tell you guys how much I love you.
- Jon is like Christmas. I only appreciate him once a year. WAKE UP, BOYS! IT'S CHRISTMAS MORNING!
- Let's see if Santa brought gifts for all the good little children.
- I guess not. Here's one for Garfield. What the heck, it's Christmas. I'll let him live. The day after Christmas I always get drepressed.
- Do you know what I mean, Garfield? Yes, I do.
- If I were you I'd be depressed every day. What a dippy sweater.
- It's not the gift, but thought that counts.
- Okay, okay, I THINK it's a dippy sweater. EEK!
- Here he is! Z
- Excuse us, Mr. Cat. We desire cheese.
- We can't sleep without our cheese.
- And if we can't sleep, you won't sleep.
- All right! All right!
- Here, if there's nothing else, I'd like to get some sleep.
- You wouldn't happen to have tiny little forks would you? Here's where I turn vicious. CAT HAIRS! They're a face of life.
- THERE ARE CAT HAIRS ALL OVER THE PLACE! So, what are you going to do about it?
- I'll be packing my bags and leaving now. Wherever I stop, we're stuck with it. Right, Garfield? Right.
- The things Jon will do for excitement...
- click click click click Television roulette. You guys will never guess what I found at the store.
- PHONY THE TEETH!
- HAR! HAR! HAR! HAR! Let's bite him in the neck. It's time to clean the fridge, Garfield. I'll call a S.W.A.T. team.
- Grim.
- I haven't seen these olives in years. And it's only halfway back. You're a very brave cat, Garfield, and I know you want me to be proud of you.
- ZOOM!
- He can smell a visit to the vet a mile away. POOKY!
- HOW DARE YOU HARM MY TEDDY BEAR! pop
- BAP BAP BAP BAP BAP YAWN
- ALL RIGHT! SNOW!
- I love the first snow of the year.
- WHOAAA!
- FUMP!
- BLAT! SPLAT! BOP!
- Did you enjoy the snow, Garfield? Quite...I'm ready for summer snow. Attention, lounge lizards! This is your week in the sun. Today we begin celebrating ""National Lazy Week""!
- What's so great about being lazy, you say?
- What if war were declared and nobody showed? Is National Lazy Week for you? Ask yourself this:
- Would you be willing to lead a parade in celebration of the lazy life?
- If the answer is yes...you're all wrong for Lazy Week. Never confuse being lazy with being apathetic. We lazy people are not apathetic.
- Apathetic people don't care about anything.
- Lazy people care, we just don't do anything about it. Do people call you ""worthless""? Do people call you a ""couch potato""?
- Why should we be held up to public ridicule just because we subscribe to a kinetically passive lifestyle. We should stand up for ourselves!
- THE NEXT TIME PEOPLE CALL YOU LAZY, TELL 'EM YOU WERE SICK WHEN YOU WERE A KID! Don't forget the National Lazy Week motto, lazy people. ""There must be an easier way"".
- Many great ideas have been spawned from that noble sentiment.
- You can bet it wasn't an exercise freak who invented power steering. For those of you who want to stop abusing your bodies through fanatic exercise, but can't muster the willpower...
- You can now join ""Garfield's Exercisers Anonymous"".
- Every time you feel an uncontrollable urge to jog, I send someone over with a mug of warm milk and a tape of the Beverly Hillbillies. Waterin' down the coffee again, pilgrim?
- Burp

- JON!
- JON! WAKE UP! I'M HAVING NIGHTMARES!
- Garfield, if you didn't stuff yourself right before going to bed, you wouldn't dream about big, ugly monsters.
- Did you hear what he called you guys?
- I think I'll polish off that pepperoni pizza now. Isn't this great, Garfield? We have a whole day of fishing ahead of us! Hotcha.
- HEY! WHERE's THE BAIT? Bait?
- GARFIELD! I thought it was sushi. Actually, Garfield is pretty easy to care for.
- Cats are so clean, always primping and washing themselves.
- We're out of foot powder. Almost to a fault. Ah, my dear, you're as lovely as ever, but, you look so stiff and formal in that outfit.
- Why don't you slip into something more comfortable?
- LIKE ME!
- CHOMP!
- SPRONG! Just what is an heirloom?
- A heirloom is something that's been in your family for generations...
- That no one's had the guts to pitch out. zzzzzzz
- zzzzzzz
- zzzzzz Just as I suspected. * Oh, Nermalll *
- Kittens love to chase things.
- CRASH! This can be a very satisfying form of enterteinmant.
- BONK! Kittens also love to play catch.
- But, the best way to drive them wild is to hide objects from them.
- ROWR! cRUNCH! HISS!
- But, not for very long. GARFIELD! WAKE UP!
- I've made a decision that could alter the course of my entire life.
- I have decided to grow a mustache. I suppose I could blame this on monday. Notice anything different about me, Garfield? You're not drinking out of your Binky The Clown mug.
- I think my mustache is coming in rather nicely. That's not your cocoa?
- Wanna touch it? It feels really weird. Hey, buddy, I have to eat with these hands! Look Odie! A hideous hairy monster is nesting under Jon's nose!
- Maybe it'sll spread and cover the rest of his face.
- Are you making fun of me? IT MOVED! Mustaches do strange things to people.
- They make some guys think they're someone they're not.
- Frankly, my dear, I don't give a darn. I don't feel safe here anymore. ARRRGH!
- JON! WHAt HAPPENED? I'M FINE! GO AWAY!
- ARE YOU OKAY? TELL ME! The shaver snagged my mustache, okay? I shaved my mustache off, Garfield. Do tell.
- I decided it made me look like a walrus. I'm proud of you, Jon.
- It takes a big walrus to admit his mistakes. How's my little buddy today? Crowded.
- TAP TAP TAP
- Garfield, what are you doing?
- SNAP! Charades? I love charades! Let's see...first word...you? No, you're! That's it! You're!
- Leg! No! Stand! You're standing in something!
- Fourth word! MY! You're standing in my!
- I GOT IT! FOOD! YOU'RE STANDNIG IN MY FOOD!
- That was a good one. Now it's my turn. This is a movie title, okay?
-
- Amused, Garfield? That's ""Mr. Fig Face"" to you. *
- * Here I am falling asleep face down in a bowl of food.
- This is it. I've reached the pinnacle of laziness and gluttony...how depressing.
- There's no place to go after you've reached the top. I eat too much because I'm depressed, and I'm depressed because I eat too much.
- It's a vicious circle...
- That took years to perfect! BANG! BANG! Hello? Anybody home?
- BRINNNNNG!
- Next time, use the door knocker. Sorry.
- STOP RIGHT THERE!
- Sometimes that's all a cat understands. Don't slobber on the controls, Mr. Odie!
- WHAT HO?!
- Pistachios! And they're all mine!
- crack BOING!
- SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF
- SNORT!
- SLURP!
- Dogs APPEAR friendly, but, I'd hate to get caught between one and his appetite. BURP
- BONK!
- GARFIELD! SPEAK TO ME! Aunty Em? Is that you? Garfield! That was a nasty fall you took. Are you all right`
- Garfield? Who's Garfield?
- OH, nO! HE'S LOST HIS MEMORY! I do seem to rememger being hungry. Having anmesia isn't so bad. It'll be kind of fun finding out what a great guy I am.
- ARRRGH!
- OH, NO! I'M A CAT! Maybe seeing Odie will jog your memory. What a swell looking dog. Put 'er there.
- YIP! YIP! YIP!
- I woner if I'm going to like this Garfield? Look, Garfield. It's Pooky! Your favorite possession and closest friend. Do you remember Pooky?
- Don't be silly. I'm a grown cat. What would I need with a teddy bear? Amnesia has wiped my slate clean. I start establishing who I am today.
-
- I am (burp) a glutton. Hey, stranger. This body ain't big enough for the both of us.
- What a week...I fall on my head, totally lose my memory, and have no idea who this Garfield fella is.
-
- HANg ON! SOMETHING'S COMING BACK!
- HA! HA!
- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
- I'm terribly sorry about that. You see, I'm not myself today. Amnesia is weird. This Garfield is like a total stranger to me.
- I know nothing about him.
- Aside from what the creep did to my body. This should jog your memory, Garfield... LASAGNA!
- No thank you. You wouldn't have a plump, juicy mouse, wouldn't you?
- ARRRGH! I'd never get this stuff out of my whiskers. You just HAVE to restore Garfield's memory, doc.
- He doesn't beat up on Odie, he doesn't claw the furniture, he's not lazy and obnoxious...
- Are you sure you want me to do this? Come to think of it... Let's test his reflexes. DONK!
-
- DOING! Normal. For Garfield. Perhaps Garfield's amnesia could be cured by lightly traumatizing his cranium.
- KNOCK MY CAT ON THE HEAD?! WHO WOULD EVER DO SUCH A THING?!!
- May I be of assistance? You stay out of this. Go ahead. A little tap on the head may bring your cat's memory back. DONK!
- GONK!
- HEY! I CAN REMEMBER! IT'S ME! GARFIELD THE CAT! Garfield? Who's Garfield?
- dig dig dig dig
- ?
- dig dig dig
- ?!!
- DIG DIG DIG
- pat pat pat RIIINNNGG Z
- SMASH!
- I hate alarm clocks. I hate spiders!
- STOMP!
- I hate hating spiders.
-
- I hate wax doughnuts.
- FWANG!
- I hate folding chairs. SWOOSH
- BLAT! I hate windy days. Z
- CRACK
- I hate leg cramps. This kind of tired calls for coffee straight up.
-
- It's one of those mornings.
- The kind of morning where you've been up for two minutes and it feels like two days.
- If I can just make it to my coffee, I'll be all right.
- It's in sight! Come on, Garfield! You can make it!
- WHUMP!
- Z So close, and yet so far.
-
- GOINK GOINK GOINK
- MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
- PTOOEY Aw, poor doughnut, you look lonely.
- You need a friend.
- I have a lasagna I'd like you to meet. Can I have half of that doughnut, Garfield?
- NO! GOOMP!
- GARFIELD!
- That's my last jelly filled doughnut!
- CLAP SQUIP! What filing might you be? Jelly? Cream?
-
- You won't, perchance, know anything about spinach-filled doughnuts, would you? GRRROOWLL rrrr
- Doughnuts!
- MUNCH MUNCH CHOMP SMACK
- More! I must have more!
- MORE!
- MOMMY!
- POW
- Garfield? Stop me! Stop me before I snack again! WOOF!
- Back off, you dumb mutt, or I'll scratch your...
- ankles off.
- ARRRGH!
- It was only a dream! It was only a dream! It was only a dream! Garfield, I just don't know what I see in you. It is a bit overwhelming, isn't it?
- You're rude, obnoxious, fat, selfish, egotistical, and totally devoid of any charm.
- I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL Arlene, I think it's time we get serious. You do?
- Yes, serious about getting that gap between your teeth fixed.
- The truth hurts. YAWN
- ARRRRGH!
- I love it when Jon loves a cake.
- 'cause I get to lick the icing out of the bowl.
- GARFIELD!! Of course, he'd prefer I wait till AFTER he's iced the cake. *
- FFT! BANG! UGH! Rats! The washer's broken!
- Com on, Garfield, we have to go to the laundromat.
- NO, JON! PLEASE ANYWHERE BUT THERE.
- You know what that place is like! Especially on weekends.
- I'll get him for this. Garfield, you need more vegetables in your system. What are you going to do? Drive a carrot through my heart?
- Here, have some spinach. OH-NO!
- GASP! CHOKE! COUGH! Stop being melodramatic, Garfield. Eat your spinach, Garfield.
- It's good for you.
- Well, now that's more like it! Have some spinach, Garfield.
- Sure, and let's garnish it with a big box of raisins.
- ZIP! I HATE THEM TOO! Spinach.
- It tastes bad. It looks bad.
- SPLUT! It even sounds bad. Yuck! Spinach!
-
- Garfield! You ate all your spinach! Not really. It's in the saltshaker. I hate spinach.
- It's green, it's slimy.
- And it looks like it's moving. SMACK! You used all the hot water again.
- La la laaah

-
-
-
- SLAM!
- Isn't that disgusting? Just look at that, Reba! I'm looking! I'm looking! RRINNGG!
- Hello? Iuh, I think you have the wrong number.
- But...would you care to make it the right number, songbird? This is a lonely man here. So what's your name, sweet thing? I can't believe Jon!
- How about a date? Trying to get a date with a wring number.
- Tomorrow at seven? Great! A DESPARATE wrong number. Garfield, I'd like you to meet my date.
- MOMMA MIA!
- What's with your cat? He's, uh, terrified of daisies. Now, be nice to my date. She might be sensitive about her weight. How'd she get in here? Through the garage door?
- Her name is Bertha. Figures.
- She's a lovely person. You can't judge a book by it's cover, you know. And you can't judge a ship by its hull. Bertha, I'd like you to meet Garfield.
- He could use some meat on his bones.
- Affectionate sort, isn't he? He's a sucker for sweet talk. Think, Jon, think. There's gotta be SOMETHING nice to say to your date.
- My, your teeth are round. I eat a lot.
- You don't say! No! Really! Yes, sir. Table for five.
- Z
-
- There it is! Just like I told you! Z
- Hey, cat! What is the meaning of this trap? Wha...?
- You realize this is a direct violation of our treaty agreement. Aw, gimme a break.
- You know this means war! Look, nobody says you have to step on it. TO ARMS! TO ARMS! This should be cute.
- I remember when I liked mice. Now don't make a bad impression on my date. Don't worry, Jon. I'll leave that up to you.
- Ready for dinner, Bertha?
- Is the sky blue? Do cats hate dogs? I think you're going to like this restaurant, Bertha. As long as they serve food. A woman after my own heart.
- Would you like a table or a booth? A table, please. And the lady will have a booth.
- What do you have to do to get any serive around here? You have to get to your table first. That's a stupid rule. And how would madame like her steak?
- Just run the steer by the table and I'll grab off a hunk!
- HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! Et tu, Garfield? Boy, I couldn't eat another bite. Would you like my...
- SHOOP!
- rrrr rrrr I guess we don't need a doggie bag. How was your meal, Bertha? GREAT! THANKS! SLAP! SPLUT!
- Just be thankful she didn't hate it. It was nice meeting you, Bertha. I hope you had a good time.
- OH, I had a wonderful time! mmmph!
- How was your date? I think I made an impression on her. HA! HA! HA! HEE! HA!
-
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, naaaah *
- * We're going for a walk, and you have to wear a dog coat. *
- * We're gonna walk by some dogs, and they're gonna call you a nerd. *
- * Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, naaaah *
- Come on, Garfield, let's get ready for our walk.
- Maybe lightning will strike me, and save me the humiliation. Garfield, meet the newest member of our family, Sweety Bird.
- I just know you two are going to get along famously, right, Garfield?
- Right, sure. Uh, would you happen to have a light for my cutting torch? Hello, I'm Sweety Bird. I sing sweet happy songs to brighten your morning.
- BRIGHTEN MY MORNING?! DO YOU WANT TO BRIGHTEN MY MORNING?!
- Then you can march out of that cage and crawl between two slices of bread. JON! Garfield, do you like sweety bird? He's right up there with dogs and mondays.
- You wouldn't intend him any harm, would you? I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then why is he covered with clam sauce? An old family recipe. SQWAWK!
- HONK!
- Did we remember how to open the bird cage? Not only that, we forgot birds could fly. Hey, bird! You think you're safe out there, huh?
- Well, I have a little treat for you!
- Have you, perchance, ever heard a cat scream? Hey, Garfield! What are you doing out there?
- And look! Sweety bird's on your head!
- WHERE'S MY CAMERA? I loathe life.
-
-
-
- You know, Garfield, sharing is one of life's greates pleasures.
- GULP!
- I love giving people pleasure. Hurry, Garfield, the TV workout show is about to start!
- You promised you''d try it. So let's go. Okay, but first answer me this...
- Just how the heck am I supposed to move? GARFIELD!
- YOU SHREDDED MY RUNNING SHOES! Someday you'll thank me for that, Jon.
- Jogging's the disease. I'm the cure. Okay, stand up straight and put your hands on your hips.
- Those of you too fat to find your hips, just give it your best guess.
- I hate sarcastic fitness instructors. Now for jumping jacks on the two count.
- ONE! CRASH!
- Oh, by the way, before we get to two, don't try this exercise on a recently polished floor. NOW he tells me. That's good, everybody. Push up!
- ...and down!
- ...and up!... I was built for push-ups. No, seriously, Linda, I'm a fun guy. I do great impressions!
- You do impressions too? Let's hear one.
- Listen to this, Garfield, She sounds like a dial tone! This man has no brain. The lone gourmet strikes again.
- TAP! TAP!
- YAWN
- You go out and play, Pooky.
- ZIP! WHAT tHE...?
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! I'M NAILED TO MY BED!
- WHA?!!
- I suppose this was for putting the lizard in your shoe? Now we're even. You're a slob, Garfield, Why can't you stay as clean as other cats?
- You're supposed to wash yourself like this. Oh, very well.
- Start with this arm and make it snappy. You have a lot of territory to cover.
-
- See anything you like? Do you know what I hate most about this bed?
- UNNNGH!
- Trying to sleep on my back. It's time to get up.
- CREAK! CRACK!
- It's also time to go on and diet. OH, NO! YOU CHEWED UP MY NEWSPAPER AGAIN!
- Hey! This isn't the paper I get. It must belong to a neighbor.
- KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! A 250 lb. neighbor, to be precise. Thin ice -->
- SPLOOSH!
- Hexy! THIS ice isn't thin!
- Neither are you. I hate 3-D movies.
- Here, Odie! Here, boy!
- I'll throw the bone and you fetch it, okay, boy? Arf!
- There it goes!
- Odie just fell for the oldest trick in the book.
- ZIP! WHUMP
- Now what kind of dog would have a bone that big?
- Oh, THAT kind of dog. This is a perfect day to stay in bed and contemplate life's truths.
- Yip! Yip! BRINNNG! GET UP, GARFIELD!
- Truths like: ""mondays stink"". Life has many good things to offer: music, art, literature...
- Sometimes I think about educating myself on those subjects...
- But then I tihnk, ""stick with what you know"". How did you get to be so lazy, Garfield?
- Brains, hard work, tenacity and dedication. You're not just born lazy, you know. It's an acquired skill...
- I'm sorry I asked. ...an art form if you will, not unlike poetry, dance or music. Here comes the mailman, Garfield. I want you to be on your best behavior.
- ROWRR!
- I must admit, that was one of my better behaviors. I ate too much.
- I'll probably get another sermon from Jon.
- Garfield, you eat too much. I was hoping you wouldn't notice. screeee And just what are you doing?
- SWIPE!
- Your turn. YOU GOTTA JUSTIFY EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU?! Where did you find the brain, Nermal...at a garage sale?!
-
- Rats...bees.
-
- Buzz off, bees. This is my territory. Z?!
- The old ""big bee"" routine works every time.
- ZZZZZ
- ZZZZZZ It was high noon when the stranger rode into town.
- Now comes my favorite part...
- He hitched up his horse and ambled into the saloon. I am hungry.
- Therefore I am.
- Rationalizing another bout with gluttony, Garfield. I don't discuss philosophy with pea brains. Now I lay me down to sleep...
- Hold that thought...
- I think I heard Garfield open the refrigerator door. JON! JON! WAKE UP! IT'S HORRIBLE! IT'S AWFUL! YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING!
- WHA tIS IT, GARFIELD?! IS THE HOUSE ON FIRE?! IS THERE A BURGLAR?! WORSE!!!
- I have hunger pangs! I love this feeling of power.
-
- Now I want to watch a cooking show! click Ah, I see Jon placed a pie on his windowsill to tempt me.
- Well, let it be known I'm capable of resisting all temptations!
- I just don't choose to. Ouch! Where did the mailman get chain mail socks?
- All right! It's here!
- Look, Garfield! It's the world's largest balloon! We'll see about that.
- Uh...that's pretty big, Garfield, You ain't seen nothing yet. fuh! fuh! fuh!
- Garfield?! fuh! fuh! fuh! fuh! fuh!
- THAT'S ENOUGH, GARFIELD! fuh! fuh! fuh! Never! fuh! fuh! fuh!
- Tie it off! Tie it off! It's either me or tihs balloon! Aha! So Jon's trying to sneak off on vacation without me, huh?
- He'll have quite a surprise in store for him.
- Who says nothing good ever happens on a monday? Laziness and procrastination go hand in hand.
- See this hair?
- It's cat hair I never got around to shedding last year.
- Huh, the stereo's all the way up, and there's no sound.
- I'd better tell Jon. You know, Garfield, they say inside every fat person there's a thin person trying to get out.
- I know what you mean.
- Mine escaped about nine years ago and I haven't seen him since. Hey, Garfield, the gang and I wanted to give you a gift of appreciation. How sweet!
- Why the show of affection? We just like having you around.
- Besides, if you left, Jon might get a REAL cat! How about a nice quiet breakfast for two, Garfield? Great idea!
- SLAM! click
- Sometimes Jon can be so thoughtful Come on, Odie. There's no reason to be afraid of the dark.
-
- Just look at this! Someone has left the cellar door open!
- Jon has told me a hundred times to keep it closed.
- Or somebody might get hurt. SLAM!
- thump thump thump thump thump thump BONK!
- Sorry about that, Jon. I'm hungry! Patience, Garfield.
- It's time you learn a little patience.
- Patience is waiting for the pizza to thaw. Look at that stomach, Garfield. That's disgusting!
- I'm putting you on a diet.
- Rat fink. Hello, diet. Goodbye, food.
- ERRRK!
- Hello, sugar withdrawal. Okay, Odie, I heard you dogs are supposed to be good at tracking things. Maybe you can help me...
- Here's a picture of a lasagna. Now get it, Odie! Get it!
- Grrrrrr! I've only been on this diet for two days and I feel thinner already.
-
- It must be a delayed reflection. Fat's a funny thing. You never lose it from the right places.
-
- Fat has a sick sense of humor. Stop being so melodramatic, Garfield, You've only been on your diet for ten minutes.
- Z
- Mmm, food!
- I love food.
- GARFIELD! YOUR EATING IS OUT OF CONTROL!
- More food!
- More trainloads of food! Air-drop food into my mouth! More cattle! Hurry! I'm hungry!
- Ahhh! Dessert!
- POOF!
- The only good thing about a diet is the great dreams. Boy, I wish I had a fifty pound pan of lasagna.
- KRONG!!!
- Now wouldn't you think I'd know better than to make a wish like that on a monday. There are many ways to make a diet more appealing.
- Some say it helps to dress your food up.
- I say it still looks like celery. I hate diets.
- They're morally wrong.
- A stomach is a terrible thing to waste. OH, GARFIELD!
- You've done so well on your diet I'm giving you a treat.
- OH MY GOSH! I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO EAT! Let me put it this way...have you ever considered a career as a river barge?
- Your mother was a blender.
- That hurt. Come on, take a chance, weigh yourself! I'll be kind! Trust me!
- BOY! ARE YOU FAT!
- Not to mention gullible, too. How about some fine cuisine en boite this evening, my dear? That's French for ""food in a can"".
- KNOCK KNOCK
- Good evening, Lori, my dear. Our dinner awaits.
- Your steak, madam. pant pant pant
- ODIE! GET OUT OF HERE!
- rrrrr GIMME THAT!
- LET GO! LET GO! LET GO!
- AYIIIIEEEEE!!! What's with her? Pet hater. Guess what I got at a garage sale today, Garfield? You got my attention.
- Tah-dah!
- Isn't it great? That diet must've been murder, huh, fella? I can't believe Jon actually bought that thing. What good is it it?
-
- MA! COME QUICK! THE COW'S SICK! Hey, mom, guess what I got at a garage sale?
- I bought one of those cow skulls like you see in the old westerns. Behind you, Jon!
- Hang on, mom, I think I'm about to scream or something. Garfield, did you know everything evolves from a lower life form? I didn't know that?
- Why, of course! It all makes sense now!
- Rocks evolved from dogs! GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- I'm unraveling your dental floss.
- I HATE THAT! Oh, very well, Tomorrow we'll do something you like. Here you go, Garfield!
- CRUNCH!
- It doesn't have much of a sense of humor, does it?

- I wouldn't say you're fat, but...
- Then don't. I bought you a surprise today, Garfield!
- It's a sweater made especially for you! Wide Load
- YAWN
-
- I think the old blanket is due for a wash. We cats love to roam around in the dark.
- Our keen eyesight allows us to see perfectly in the blackest of...
- click I think I'll curl up and die now. Here's something a little different for dinner tonight, Garfield.
- I'm putting you on a high-fiber diet.
- Let me guess. There's another spider in the house.
-
- ARRRRGH!
- GARFIELD! HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO LIE NEAR THE DOOR?!
- I'M SICK OF TRIPPING OVER YOU! All right! All right!
- Why does this always happen to me?
- ARRRRGH!
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO LIE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM?! I can't win. Normally, I hate alarm clocks.
- But this one I like.
- It's broken.
- WOOAAH! trip
- GARFIELD! Watch where you're going!
- Why don't YOU watch where I'm going? A spider!
- YIPE!
- Whew! Oh, Jon, may I borrow your book for just a moment?
- WHAP!
- Thank you so much. Anytime. Tell me, Garfield.
- If nature is goverend by survival of the fittest...
- HOW COME YOU'RE STILL AROUND?! I stay out of drafts. Z You're pathetic, Garfield.
- What am I going to do with you?
- Well, for starters, you could occasionally wake me and remind me to swallow. Help me. CRUNCH
- YAWN

- Z Z
- Z PUNT!
- Z
- Yawn. I had the most wonderful dream last night.
- WHUMP! Yawn-well let's see what kind of day today is...
- CRICK CRICK CRICK CRICK CRICK CRICK CRICK CRICK CRICK
- It's a nine cricker.
- I could look like this if I wanted to.
- But, I don't have enough hands. Hey, Garfield, you're going to be nine years old this friday. Thanks for reminding me.
- As cats go, you're approaching the golden years.
- The heck with the golden years. I'm five and holding. What's the matter, Garfield? Feeling your years now that you're turning nine?
- Come closer, my son. I'm having trouble hearing you.
- SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GARFIELD!! That sure is a lot of candles.
- Oh well, I should be happy to have a birthday, I guess. fffff
- As opposed to the alternative. Yup.
- I'm nine years old all right.
- According to the rings under my eyes. I hate it when Odie plays by my rules.
- Sigh...time to wake up and go to bed.
- SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE
-
-
- YAWN
- It must have been something I ate.
- POOMP!
- BLAT! SQUIRT!
- YEEEOW! I'm hungry. SWIPE
- THAt HURT!! I'll say...I think I broke a nail. There you go, Garfield. Eat heartly!
- Dry cat food and hose water.
- Be still, my beating taste hurts. Garfield, we're out of cat food. How about dog food instead?
- Let me put it this way, it's either dog food or nothing.
- Arf. I'll get it. Look, Garfield, I don't care if you think it tastes awful. You'd better eat that because you're not getting anything else!
- SPLUT!
- Hmmm...he's right. It DOES taste pretty awful. Do you know how to get a finicky cat to heat his cat food?
- Pretend you're going to take it away from him.
- It works every time. You're going on a diet, Jon! NO! NO!
- Z
- Z
- Z
- SNORT. WHA?!!
- GARFIELD, I'M TRYING TO SLEEP! WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- What every other cat in the world wants from its owner at 3:00 A.M.
- My teddy bear! FLIP FLIP FLIP FLIP FLIP
- Just as I thought, june 29, 1987.
- ""The World's Longest Monday"". Garfield! You fixed my funny glasses! Yup.
- How did you do it? I used glue.
- HEY! THEY'RE STUCK TO MY FACE! Gee, Jon, I guess this means I'll never be able to take you seriously again. I'd like to buy some glue solvent. Is this a holdup?
- No, you see, my cat glued these glasses to my face. Your cat?
- Sounds silly, huh? Not at all...hello, police? FLEA SPRAY TO THE RESCUE!
- SSSSSSS
- Oops, this is my deodorant. Great, I'd hate to think I was offending them. Look Garfield, I bought you a rubber mouse. What's that for?
- You can chase it, toss it in the air, stalk it and pounce on it. Yes?
- Oh, forget it. Maybe it plays music or something. RAOW! RAOW! RAOW! You know, I wonder what a dog would do with a cat if it ever caught one?
- SCREEEE Okay, mutt! You caught me! Now what are you going to do with me?!
- Next time I lead, all right? No Soliciting Attack Cat On Duty
-
- Okay, Odie, now for a lesson in home plumbing.
- All the water lines in this house are connected.
- Thusly, if I turn the hot water on here, there will no longer be hot water in Jon's shower.
- Observer.
- YEOWWW!
- GET OFF THAT SINK! Ain't science great? GULP MUNCH GOBBLE SMACK GLUB SLURP SNARF
- BURP
- And people say dinner conversation is a lost art. Hey, gang, the cat's away!
- * **
- That oughta make'm paranoid. I'm depressed, Garfield, Hang on. I have just the thing.
- This should cheer you up.
- And, of course, misery loves company. Pizza is friendy and bananas are funny.
- Peaches love to be squeezed and peas occasionally pop in.
- I love food with personality. Hehwo, widdle puddy tat!
- Is'm widdle puddy tat a nicey wicey puddy tat?
- Excuse me while nicey wicey puddy tat takes a barfy warfy in the grassy wassy. Bye-bye, puddy tat.
- The next person to talk baby talk to me gets his clock cleaned.
- Why, hehwo widdle puddy tat! Odie washes and I dry.
- Sigh.
-
-
- PANT PANT PANT SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH PANT
- Remember to look both ways before crossing the street, Odie.
- SCREEE
- The point, of course, being to see if there are any cars coming. Are you ready for the opera, Steven?
- click
- Why did you change the program? La-la-laaah. It wasn't insulting to my intelligence any more. *
- ROWR!
- Garfield's sick this morning, he asked me to fill in for him. LEAVE THAT FERN ALONE! DO YOU HEAR ME?!
- Good heavens, you really ARE listening to me. Could it be you're starting to respect me?
- Let's see you make that little thing that hangs down in the back of your throat dance around again! I saw this science fiction movie last night about vegetables who imitated other life-forms.
- I turned it off...
- I watch TV to escape. Hey, Garfield. Wanna go running this morning? You've got to be kidding.
- Hard breathing can cause brain damage.
- pant pant pant I rest my case.
- This could be any refrigerator, maybe yours.
- Deep within the frozen wastes it lurks.
- Ancient mayonnaise, fossilized cabbage, slowly mutating over untold eons, gradually achieving consciousness...
- Until that terrible day when it is unleashed upon an unsuspecting world.
- THE COLESAW THAT TIME FORGOT! AYIEEE!
- Cute, Garfield. Now finish cleaning out the refrigerator. Quiet, fool! You'll awaken the sleeping spuds from the planet fungus. Ah, a nice sumptuous meal all alone...
- And Garfield nowhere in sight.
- And that worries me. I'm going to let you decide what to do today, Pooky...
- poomp
- Not much for talk, but, what an idea man! You'd lose some weight if you'd exercise, Garfield.
-
- Maybe if I breathed a little deeper. I'm bored...I hate boredom.
- Hurry, Garfield! A quilting bee special is comoing on the television!
- And then some people revel in it. Cats can stop in an instant.
-
- Provided that instant isn't on a throw rug. I can understand why you watch TV to escape, Garfield, You have so mucht to escape...
- The 12 hour naps, the free room and board, the nonstop snacking.
- The srcasm, Jon. You forgot the endless sarcasm. My zest for life must be a quart low.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Garfield and his trained dog will now perform for you.
- Do a back flip, Odie.
- Beg, Odie.
- Roll over, Odie.
- GARFIELD! DINNER!
- Burp, boy, great dinner.
- Now where's Odie? Let's go fishing, Garfield.
- Well, what do you think? I think you're right.
- Fish paralyzed by hysterical fits of laughter probably ARE easier to catch. Got my equipment, got my flies. Let's go fishing!
- Hang on, Garfield!
- My body is hooked to the drapes.
- This is going to be a long day. Poor little worms, waiting to be skewered on Jon's hook and then fed to some vicious fish. Well it's not right!
- YOU'RE FREE! YOU'RE FREE!
- Swimming must not be one of their strong suits. Remember, Garfield, the key to fishing is patience., the ability to remain motionless for hours.
- Garfield? Z That's my boy. Well, Garfield, what do you think of fishing so far?
- I like it?
- Where else can you take a three-hor nap and call it sport? Catch anything, boys?
- Yeah, but we threw 'em back.
- They were in danger of being eaten by the bait.
- Hello, plants. Oh no! Shoo! Scat!
- Well, let's see what's on the menu today. Mrs Brown! There's a cat out here!
- I think I'll start with a salad. NOOO! RUN, HAROLD! RUN!
- GLOMP HAROOLD! WE GOT HAROLD!
- burp Oh, Ralph! What will we do?! Stay calm, Tammy. I'll jump of the sill and run for help!
- Now for dessert. Hurry, Ralph! Hurry! I think I broke something! Let's go for a walk, Garfield. It's good exercise.
- Even a short walk is better than no walk at all. You're right.
- Start with the kitchen and back. I am an artist.
- SCHOONK!
- I eat what I see. tap tap tap
- Well, well, well, and just how did you get in there?
- Would you believe hours and hours of careful planning? Get up, Garfield, Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, you know.
- You're quite right, Jon. I couldn't agree with you more.
- Now, be a good boy and bring it back at noon. You know, Garfield, life is like a bowl of cherries.
-
- Let down your guard, and I'll get you. You're going to pay for this one. Hey, Garfield, they're developing computers with artificial intelligence. Big deal.
-
- I'll be impressed when they invent artificial cunning. CLICK!
-
- CLICK!
- FLIP NNNNNG
- UNNNGH WHAP!
- SHOOP! FLOP!
- SNAP! WHIP! BAP!
- No wonder. This is the garage door opener. Ahhh! Coffee. NO! NO! DON'T DRINK IT, JON!
- SHOOP! ARRRGH! IT'S TOO LATE.
- Z THAT COFFEE WAS DECAFFEINATED, YOU FOOL!
-
- What does one have to do to get one's belly scratched around here? There's only one way to get rid of a free-floating guilt complex.
- Do something to deserve it. We humans are lucky, Garfield. We can sing and play instruments.
- You cat have no way of showing your appreciation for music. Oh, but I do.
- I sold your piano. Have the last cookie, Garfield. I really couldn't. You take it.
- Okay.
- You twit! Don't you know insincere sincerity when you hear it? Uh-oh, it looks as though Mr. Cliche is about to unburden himself of another stale platitude.
- ""He who fills his pockets with the rocks of misdeeds will surely sink in the river of good fortune"".
- That boy wasn't born, he was found in a fortune cookie.
- Is this seat taken? Not at all.
- Wow! That's a big cat! He didn't look that big from the front of the bus 'cause things look smaller from far away.
- You, if he had a mane he'd look like a lion, but, then they'd make him get off at the zoo, I suppose!
- Zoos make me nervous. I'm never sure which side of the bars I'm on. I wonder if the animals feel that way too?
- Well, I gotta change seats. You guys talk too much. I can't hear myself think.
- You sure meet some characters on the bus. Watch what you say! Uranus has spies everywhere!
-
- I had an uncle who used to play with yarn...
- He's now a pattern in an angora sweater.
- You're just saying that to ruin my fun, aren't you? Can you afford to take a chance? You've got a pretty good thing going here, don't you? Yup.
- Jon feeds me, strokes me, changes my kitty litter and caters to my whims. So what does HE get out of it?
- He gets to call himself ""Master"". With each new day, a cat's curiosity must be satisfied anew.
- KICK
- Yup, the law of gravity is still in effect. Dear Hair Ball Cat Food Co., I find your cat food gives my cat a ""long silky coat of hair"" as advertised...
- However, I think you should add a disclaimer.
- ""Do not feed your cat more than 36 cans a day."" You're wasting your life away, Garfield. You should be out there...uh...
- Out there doing whatever it is cats do.
- That's what I like about being a cat. Our standards are low. Up next, ""Pasta Parade,"" followed by ""World of Waffles"". I love this all-food channel.
- I ask you...what more to life could there possibly be?
- Decisions, decisions...
- Should I eat first and then sleep or sleep first and then eat?
- Hmmm...I usually eat first. Maybe I should sleep first for a change of pace.
- On the other hand, if I sleep first, Odie might eat my food before I wake up.
- *
- Z Stupid pet door!
- UI thought Jon fixed it!
- Unnngh! Jon, remember when you thought it was a great idea to put the pet door in?
- And how Odir and I could come and go as we pleased?
- You goofed again. About your weight, Garfield.
- You're getting a bit large for your pet door.
- Do tell. PURRR
- How nice! Are you rubbing against my neck to tell me how much you love me?
- Or to tell me, if I don't feed you'll rip off my face? Bingo! ...and I was wondering if you'd go out with me tonight?
- You say you'd rather go out with camel spittle? Zap her back! Zap her back!
- ""But what if your brother already has plans?"" That's what I should have said! Ol' Lighning Wit strikes again. WHIRRRRRRR
- WHIRRRRRR
- WHIRRRRRR I love driving Odie up the wall.
-
-
-
- YANK WHIRRRR
- WHIRRRR
-
- There's one thing I can count on from Garfield.
- Nice drapes, Arbuckle. It would be a shame if someone else slashed 'em into party streamers.
- Protection. I wonder how Garfield would handle an emergency? Z
- FIRE!
- I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Hurry, Garfield! Get to the car!
- Quick! Lock the doors! Roll up the windows!
- They'rfe probably watching the house right now. We'll have to move out of state! He used an expired coupon. Ah, it's so nice to own a cat.
- Own? Nobody OWNS a cat.
- But you may think of me as a longterm loan. Leave that station on, Garfield. It's ""Hamlet"".
- To be or not to be. CLICK!
- Hey! What are you doing?! Solving an existential dilemma with modern technology. I feel like letting my better nature show through today.
- PUNT!
- My worse nature is not a pretty sight. Why is it the phone only rings when I'm in the bath? Relax, one call a week isn't that bad.
- BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP
- That's right, Beverly, I will not go out with you tonight.
- Yes, I know you're madly in love with me, but I have better things to do.
- Now, now, Beverly, you know I hate it when you grovel and stop sobbing uncontrollably.
-
- At the sound of the tone the time will be 10:00 A.M.
- BEEP Oh, shut up. You monster, how dare you break that computer's heart? Ah-ah-AH
- CHOO
- Bless you. Let's hear it for sleep!
- Gimme a ""Z""!
- Z Just look at the smile on Garfield's face. Z
- He must be having a great dream. Z
- Z Z P-thb-thb-thb-thb!
- PTHB THB
- Look, Odie! I can touch my nose with my tongue!
- Can you do that?
- Sleep is wonderful.
- What would people be without sleep?
- Real tired, probably. Jon, is this one of those cult films?
- One, two! One, two! One, two!
- Hey, Garfield, I've noticed you're pretty out of shape. Nonsense, I watch 30 minutes of Aerobics a day.
- So I bought you these jogging shoes! I hope you kept the receipt.
- See? These shoes are built to absorb shocks.
- WHACK!
- He's right, I barely felt that.
- The shoes, where are they? Last I saw 'em, they were jogging to the garbage disposal.
-
- Surprise, Garfield! Won't this be fun to play in?
- Take it back.
- There's no elevator. Odie is very special.
- He was bred to be a working dog.
- Specifically, a paperweight or a doorstop. Garfield, you've lost weight!
- I don't believe it!
- Garfield, you eat too much junk food. Eat something good for you.
-
- Zap...you're a carrot stick. Great chefs know it's the appearance of food that counts.
- GUP!
- But, great eaters know it's the amount of food that counts. No, please don't do it. In the name of humanity!!
-
-
-
- WHUMP!
- Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!
- ZIP!
- WHUMP!
- Haw! Haw! Haw!
- Reba! Come here and look at this, but you'd better cinch up your corset first!
- Are you ever seriuos, Garfield? I guess not.
- It's hard to be serious when you're naked! YAWN
- Yawn...boredom is contagious.
-
- OH, NO! SO'S STUPIDITY. Send To: ACME Lasagna Factory
-
- Not enough postage, Garfield. Rats. Get ready to have some major youcks, you guys.
- SMILE MOUTHS!
- Hee hee! I'll keep him laughing while you get the authorities. Garfield, what's the matter?
- JON! YOU GOTTA CLEAN OUT THE REFRIGERATOR!
- Whatever it is, it can't be that bad, old buddy. The tuna is spawning in the tomato soup! Watching the paint dry, Garfield?
- I hope he doesn't think that my life is so totally devoid of excitement that I am reduced to that.
- I'm waiting for it to peel.
- A hungry vulture perches above his prey, silently, patiently, waiting for his meal to draw its last breath.
- CLICK
-
- CLICK STOP THAT! YOU KNOW I HATE THAT!
- NO MORE VULTURES! No more vultures.
- Z A voracious alligator stealthily glides toward the fingers of an unwary river traveller. Nothing is showing up on the computer radar so I'll put a nice ""Mr. Sunshine"" right here.
- But, satellite photos show an approaching low-pressure area, so I'll put mean ol' ""Mr. Thunderstorm"" and his lighning bolt right here.
- LOOK OUT, MR. SUNSHINE! BOOM! KABOOM! BLAM! Millions in state-of-the-art electronic equipment to gather data, and we get baby talk. Let's check the weather.
- Hmmm. Looks like a good day to stay in in bed.
- Mostly boring this morning with a 50% chance of intermittent depression this afternoon. Depression is waking up with the uneasy feeling the world is out to get you.
- ZOW
- And finding out you're right. Being depressed is bad enough. Now Jon will probably try to cheer me up with stupid platitudes.
- You're depressing, Garfield. And you're fat and lazy too.
- Then again, even stupid platitudes have their good points. Cheep up, Garfield. Just remember that life is just a game.
- It's not whether you win or lose, but how you play that counts.
- So, what are you going to do today? Forfeit. I hate those little insert cards.
- SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE
- Just as I suspected. Can we be of assistance? *
- That stupid dog next door is in for a BIG surprise.
- When he comes by, he will mistake the mirror for me.
- Then he will attack and fall into this pit.
- Then this net will fall on him.
- Then this cement mixer will tip, sealing that sucker up for about ten million years.
- WAIT! WAIT! GO BACK AND COME IN AGAIN! Do you always insult the people you weigh? Yes. It's a defense mechanism.
- Insults compensate for my own depressions, my insecurities, my loathing for this job and my lot in life.
- I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks, blubber bottom.
-
- Can we take a 50-mile hike today, Jon?
- Huh? Can we? Can we? Can we? boing boing
- You're drinking too much coffee, Garfield. Or a swim. What if we swim to Tahiti? RATS! I GIVE UP!
- I'm just no good with plants.
- And these were the plastic ones. I told the woman at the flower shop I was tired of you eating my plants.
- She said you wouldn't harm this one.
- But, I doubt it. How much do I weigh today, RX-2?
- You weigh somewhere between seven and thirty-two pounds.
- I have learned it is wise to give my customers a wide selection. Like the sandwich I made for you, Odie?
- Hey, Garfield! Come out here!
- Watch me blow this bubble. You're going to get a bang out of it.
- FUH-FUH-FUH-FUH
- BANG
- You're right. That was fun.
- HERE! YOU CHEW THE GUM THIS TIME!
- That's it, fella. Blow it big. fuh-fuh
- BANG
- It's all in the lips. Hmm, my horoscope says I'm going to be visited by an old acquaintance today.
- SPLUT
- Uncanny. Ha! Missed me!
- SPLUT!
- Whoaa...boomerang spluts.
-
- SPLUT! SPLUT
- CLANK!
- They must be running out of ammo! Gourmands know their utensils. This is the table-spoon, the teaspoon, the soupspoon, the sugar spoon.
- And my personal favorite...
- Theplay spoon! toing SPLUT! Garfoield, why do you always spit the cherry pits out onto the table?
-
- I like a little floor show after dinner. One of these days, Arlene! One of these days...POW! To the moon!
-
- OH-NO! SOMEONE ATE MY DINNER!
- AHA! FAT MICE!
- You guys wouldn't know what happened to my dinner, would you? Oh, sure! Blame us.
- It's always the mice's fault, right men? Not even a fair trial.
- TYRANT! All right! I'm sorry I mentioned it.
- Well I should hope so! Yeah! And next time ease up on the taco sauce! I hope they explode. YAWN Ahh...there's nothing like a good nap.
-
- With the possible exception of TWO good naps. The coffee's strong today.
- SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP
- Not only strong, but mean! Food! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Aren't you going to eat, Garfield? 5,743, 5,744... Z
- GARFIELD!
- Fall asleep in your food again? Don't ask stupid questions. Just ge the chisel.
-
- Sigh. In the morning, there's nothing more I enjoy than a good cup of coffee.
-
- As I was saying... That's not what I meant by ""drop anchor"", little buddy.
- First things first, let's talk about me.
- You see, Renee, I'm a pretty mature, suave kinda guy.
- Are these yours?
- Heh, het. Well...uh. They have teddy bears all over them.
- What's this? A certificate of achievement from ""Thumb Suckers Anonymous"".
- GARFIELD?
- Bunny slippers? This honey has lots of options like windshield wipers and a horn.
- You mean things like windshield wipers and a horn are options?
- No offense, pal, but in your price range, the TIRES are optional. This car's a real steal at $ 1,900.
- It has twice the luggage space of any other car in its class.
- Where's the back seat? Oh, no! I'll notify the authorities. Don't go away, folks, I'll be right back.
- Honest Ed seems nice enough, Garfield, but there's something about him I don't trust.
- Maybe it's the fact his office is in a pickup truck with the engine running. Nice doin' business with you. And, remember, at Honest Ed's, we stand beside every car we sell.
- Don't you mean you stand ""behind"" every car you sell?
- Not with the mechanics I've got working for me! VAROOM! CRASH Cute, Garfield, Tell me the future.
- You are about to become upset with your cat.
- Hey, wait a minute! Where's my goldfish? It was (burp) here a minute ago. grrr yip CUT IT OUT, YOU TWO!
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT THERE! DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU ANY IDEAS?
- ffft! bark! yip! Honestly, Garfield, I forgot that it was decaffeinated. rrrrr
-
- KNEAD KNEAD KNEAD
- Z Z
- Oh, no!! My guilt!
- Oh, well,,,I suppose I shouldn't yeall at him...
- He's just doing what comes naturally for a ca
-
-
- GARFIELD! Is that today's mail, Garfield? Yo.
- Here are your personal letters, bills and catalogs.
- And ""Instant Millionaire"" giveaways. You're lazy, Garfield. You just don't understand, do you, Jon?
- In the grand scheme of things, each of us has our little niche to fill.
- Through with our rationalization, are we? It's my niche time. Mornin' hon. The usual? You got it, Irma.
-
- Say, hon. What IS the usual? I was hoping you'd know. These people are in desperate trouble. Try this new health food for cats, Garfield. It has extra fiber.
- BLUT
- Just as I suspected. Wake up, Garfield. I can't move. My battery is dead.
-
- Sniff...hang on! I think I smell a jump start coming my way! Hey, Garfield, I looked up the word ""lazy"" in the dictionary and they had your picture by it.
- That's a lie.
- I slept through the appointment for the photo session. You awake yet?
- The wild house cat spies his unsuspecting prey.
- Potato chips!
- Why do they make these bags so hard to open?
- EERRRGGHH
- NNGGNNFF SQUEEZE
- KA-BLAM!
- GARFIELD! WHAT HAPPENED? They oughta put warnings on those bags! Cats have just surpassed dogs as the country's favorite pets!
-
- Somehow the victory would have been more satisfying had the competition been stiffer. Sometimes I think I'm slowing down.
- GARFIELD! DINNER! CHOOM!
- But, there's still a little life left in the ol' afterburners. Garfield, you're never going to lose weight eating between the meals. There's only one thing to do.
- Do you know the meaning of ""willpower""?
- I don't know the meaning of ""between meals"". Look, Odie, Jon's sleeping. Z
- Mybe we should be quiet and let him rest. Z
- Or we can shave his head. Z Hey, Garfield, I have a new cat food for you.
- Come on, give it a try. It's not that bad. I don't know, Jon.
- Something tells me it isn't that good. Life is filled with opportunities.
- shake shake shake shake
- PSSSSH! If you know where to look for them. Let's just say, talking during the movie is a pet peeve of mine.
- Z
- Garfield, you must be the slowest, laziest thing on the face of the earth. On the contrary.
- I'm not slow at everything I do.
- I'm the fastest eater I know. GOOSH!
- I can fall asleep in an instant.... PLOP
- SLURP!
- BOMP!
- And I have a lighning quick temper. I've really got to stop this overeating.
-
- How about that? I didn't think I could do it. DINNER IS...
- WHOMP!
- snerved. What's the matter, Garfield? Don't you feel good? That's an understatement.
- Do you think it was something you ate? No...
- WHANG!! It was something YOU fed me! It says this cat food is ""fit for a king"".
-
- The ""king's"" food taster. I, the Caped Avenger, shall seek out injustice wherever it may lurk...
- And with one swift motion of my mighty hand, I will go...
- Naughty, naughty, naughty! What's that number on your back for, Garfield?
- It's mandatory attire for my new hobby.
- Marathon sleeping. Oops! I think I've made a tiny mistake!
- CRASH!
- Boy, am I in a rotten mood.
- Out of my way, brie breath! PUNT!
- Hey, you! You can't do that or I'll tell my sister, Loretta! Loreatta?
- She'll pound you flat! Bring her on. A good fight might cheer me up.
- Hey, Loretty! Aaaarrrgh. YAWN **

- Don't you think you've eaten enough watermelon, Garfield? Why, no.
- Why do you ask? ptoo!
-
- kick!
- I'm sorry Garfield. I didn't see you sitting...
- there. Z
-
- N Garfield, why are you so vain?
-
- In my case, modesty would be unseemly in a cat of such breeding. Where did I go wrong? Odie's never around when I need a fall guy.
- Hmmm.
- Hey, Jon, look what I can do with this grape.
- poo!
- GUNK! Oh, yeah? Watch this!
- I'm not impressed.
- WATCH THIS! OH YEAH? WATCH THIS!
- Veterinary clinic What the... Don't ask. Garfield, you've been drinking too much coffee lately. There's no such thing as too much coffee.
- I'm worried about you. Okay, okay! I'll cut down!
- Just give me half a cup.
-
- Now, THAT'S good coffee!
- Too much coffee, Garfield?
- yupyupyup I made my world famous coffee this morning, Garfield.
- Come on...it's not that bad! Have some! Oh, all right.
- But just a small slice. Sorry, Garfield, but we're out of coffee this morning. I noticed.
- I guess we'll just have to go without. That's what YOU think.
- What are you doing? Sucking on a used coffee filter. MEOWYRRRRR
- MEOWYRR...MEOWYRRR GARFIELD! What are you doing?!!
- My agent couldn't get me a booking on the fence. tap tap tap I feel awful, but I don't think it could be anything that I ate.
-
- Hee, hee, hee.
- Hey, Garfield, remember thet time I was drinking root beer and you made that funny face.
- And I snorted the root beer right out my nose?
- And I got all the way up into my sinuses.
- It was like it was fizzing right inside my brain! You've just made history, Jon.
- Hee, hee, hee. I can't finish my meal. Whoops! The ol' claw's hooked a carpet thread.
- UNNNGGGHHH!!!
- ...a LONG carpet thread. Food is a dichotomy.
- Fat people hate to love it.
- And skinny people love to hate it. Thare's nothing worse than being bored.
- Hey, there, Mr. Droopy face. Let me entertain you!
- Hotcha! Hotcha! I take that back. Cats are poetry in motion.
- trip SPLAT!
- Dogs are gibberish in neutral. Ho-boy, I ate too much again.
- WAH-HA-HA-HA!
- Oh, Garfield, you're a riot! Who's the sexiest cat you know, Arlene? Hmmm...
- Let's see...
- One thing about Arlene, she doesn't make snap judgments. Hmmm. Championship wrestlers and I have one training ritual in common, power eating.
-
- SLURP
-
- screee
-
- screee SLAM! Odie?
- Odie?
- SLURP Here's a story about a cat who travelled 200 miles to find his owner.
- Can you imagine YOU doing that, Garfield?
- HA! HA! HA! I would send a postcard. It says here that many artists starve themselves in the service of their craft.
- GLUCK
- A starving glutton...I like that. Sigh...a cat's work is never done.
- What are you doing, Garfield? PLOP!
- A cat's work. SLAM!
- In case you're wondering where I've been and what I've bought, that's none of your business.
- I love the Christmas season. OUCH! pshhh
- Hey, this isn't shaving cream!
- And this isn't tree flocking. I swear, Garfield.
- You get more excited about Christmas than any child I know!
- I DO NOT! Are you sure this is all you want for Christmas, Garfield?!
-
-
-
- This is a decoration, not a snack, comprendo?
- *
-
- The one thing I hate about the Christmas season is addressing all these cards.
- I believe I have a way to cut your work in half.
- Address this one to dad AND mom. Uh
-
- -oh...
- AAAARRRGGHHH!!! SLURP! SLURP! SLURP! Garfield, I know you're excited about Christmas.
- And I know it's only natural to be curious about what's inside your presents.
- BUT PUT THAT METAL DETECTOR AWAY! I'd better be careful with my gift. It might be a fine bone china food dish.
- Oh.
- This one's for Odie. CRASH! Well, boys, that was a wonderful Christmas. It's not over yet.
- For me?! How sweet?!
- A hairball? I made it myself. Christmas can't be over yet! I can't have unwrapped all my presents already!!
- I gotta unwrap something else!!
- More! More! I wonder what that is?
- Up and at 'em, boys! It's a bright new day!
- Let's plan the day, boys. Here we go again.
- First item of business: the Christmas tree. Let's leave it up a while longer.
- Translation! ""Let's leave the tree there till the needles fall off and mom takes it out for me in July"".
- Next item: let's go to a museum or something intellectually stimulating right after lunch.
- Translation: ""Let's eat too much and fall asleep on the couch watching television"".
- Z Z Z I admire a man of decision. HAAAACK!
- poing
- Boy, talk about your hairballs!... This year I pledge to lose weight and get in shape!
- No, no, be realistic, Garfield, That's a bit much to bite off. Perhaps I should set a bit more realistic goal.
- I pledge to establish contact with aliens from another planet! Well. it's time to take stock of the year.
- Let's see...I ate and slept and accomplished not one single thing of socially redeeming value.
- I'm so proud of me. Let's see. This year I've eaten 2,190 snacks and taken 1,822 naps.
- Oh, no! According to my figures I missed a nap in april and two in july!
- Uh...Garfield? QUIET, MAN! I HAVE SOME SERIOUS CATCHING UP TO DO! Z
- Oh, no! What happened to my toes?!
- In the natural order of things, cats aren't fat, Garfield.
- PURRR Oh, very well.
- In the natural order of things, humans ARE gullible, though. Pretty impressive, eh, Arlene. Yes, impressive that those legs can move my body.
-
- Unngh!
- GUH!
- AAAAAK!
- HIYAAAHGHA!
- One! Some egg foo young, Garfield? Sure.
- Hoe about some moo goo gai pan. Do you know what I like about chinese food?
- It's as much fun to say as it is to eat! Still haven't mastered those chopsticks, huh, Garfield?
- Mastered? ...no.
- Perfected? ...yes. I knew you'd like chinese food, Garfield, but Im surprised you ate the octopus. Octopus?
- ACK! COUGH HACK BLECK!
- Actually it wasn't half bad. Gimme that fortune cookie.
- Beware of the SPLUT!
- SPLUT! Impressions!
- A clock!
- CUCKOO CUCKOO Tah-dah! Aren't they cute? psssssh
- This stuff is guaranteed to keep pets off the furniture. It's so easy it's almost unfair. I can feel monday creeping up.
- Now for a nice loooong nap.
- Presenting RIP VAN GARFIELD The Story Of A Catnap... Z
- That Lasted 50 Years! For the first time in my life, I feel rested!
- Some Things Had Changed... Roof! Roof!
- Some Things Hadn't Changed... How about a date, doc? No way!
- And Some Things Had REALLY Changed! Set the table, mom! Here's a juicy one!
- POOF! That's it! No more pizza after midnight. I hate mondays. I need something to cheer me up.
- PUNT!
- Even gravity has it in for me today! Garfield! What are you doing? Uh...push-ups?
- The vet put you on a diet. I want a second opinion.
- How about a nice leaf of lettuce? PLease! If I laugh I might snort an anchovy! I'm so hungry from my diet I couldn't sleep last night.
- Thereby depriving me of food AND sleep, two of three things I live for.
- If the third weren't self-pity, I'd kill myself.
-
- Must you play with your food? Who's playing? I'm picking out vitamins. Garfield! You lost another pound!
- I'm so proud of you! Jon's so naive.
- It's the same pound I lose every week. Where would you like to eat, Garfield?
- This place? How come?
- ERNIE'S Eat Till You Explode Restaurant Let's just say, I have a good feeling about it. Hey, kid, isn't that Halley's comet?
-
-
-
-
- RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! IT'S A RABID MUSKRAT!
-
- I like the part where he made you fetch it on all fours. Oh, shut up. Are you sleeping again?
- I am NOT sleeping.
- I'm checking my eyelids for light leaks. Hey, you bought new socks!
- Here, let me break 'em in for you.
- Gotta Dance Gotta Dance So this is why my feet have been itching. Excuse me, Irma, there's a hair in my soup.
- How do you know it's not one of yours?
- I use smaller rollers. Hey, look, Garfield, Odie's standing on his head! So?
- Isn't that amazing?! Not really.
- How does he do that? I glued his head to the table. They say cats can see in the dark.
- CLICK Hey! It's true! I CAN see!
- I see a whole lot of dark. I shall now derive great pleasure from kicking Odie off this table.
- CRASH!
- THAT WAs DARNED INCONSIDERATE!
- There's nothing like a quiet evening at home. click
- click click click click
- gobble gobble gobble
- DONK!
- scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
- Not around here, at any rate. Guess who this letter is from? Your parents.
- They're paying us a visit! Know how I knew that?
- Who else uses barnyard scented stationery? Mom! Dad! Welcome to the big city! Ha! You call this one-horse burg big?
- Uh...care to freshen up? Like from a sink? Sure! Do it all the time!
- Your father's determined not to be taken for a country bumpkin. Cut the chat. My tractor's double-parked. Is dad okay, mom? He sounds a little hoarse. He's a little upset with you on that subject.
- With me? In your last letter you said you made your plants grow by talking to them.
- You don't mean?... Ever try to give a pep talk to 40 acres of soybeans? Here it is, dad, a modern bathroom with all the conveniences. I knoe that! What kind of rube do you think I am?
- CRACK! MODERN CONVENIENCES, HA! CHEAP, YOU MEAN!
- Pumped the handle twice and it snapped like a twig! I have a big day planned for us tomorrow, so don't forget to set your alarm, dad.
- What time? Four A.M.? Uh...whenever.
- Four o'clock, got that? Either he goes, or I go! Rise and shine, cat! On the farm we get up with the chickens. So do we.
- Except our chickens are in the freezer.
- SO THE MINUTE YOU SEE ONE OF THEM UP AND AROUND GIVE ME A CALL! I think he's falling for it! Lasagna Flavored Hibiscus
- Uh-oh.
- Look, cat, it's like this...I'm a flowering plant.
- I bring joy to this dreary existence.
- My delicate blossoms offer beauty, grace and a sense of hope to this life.
- Plant, you have touched my heart. That was very good. Thank you.
- But, not good enough! But, I bring color to the world!
- You want color? Go buy a box of crayons. Garfield, you're not still mad at me for serving you that rubber pizza last night are you? Nah.
- And you're not planning some sinister revenge, are you` I'm bigger than that.
- Maybe I'm just paranoid. Look, Garfield! This is my first serious attempt at making gourmet food. ""first humorous"" attempt is more like it.
- I call it ""chicken surprise"". Somehow, I'm not surprised.
- Fresh from the oven. I know. I heard the microwave laughing. Forget it, Garfield. I'm planning to enjoy this ALONE.
- GULP!
- Now, you're alone. Come oin, scale. Can't you see I'm waiting for your verdict?
- I don't know if I have the heart to tell you this...
- You have a heart? You have a face? Get off! I can't breathe!
- Notify my next of kin!
- I WANT it to die. If I had eyes my life would be passing before them! Sit up, Odie. Sit up, boy!
- COME ON! SIT UP! Good luck, Jon.
- It took Odie three years to learn to breathe. Sigh.
- Nobody loves me. I'm just old and fat.
- Look mommy! A little kitty. She said, ""little""!
- Here, little kitty kitty kitty. Bless you, child!
- Well, I wouldn't exactly say ""little,"" dear. What would you say, mommy?
- Hmm, how about old and fat?
- Here, old and fat kitty kitty kitty. Life belts me up the side of the head once again. I hate february.
- But february starts out irritating, becomes boring and ends up depressing.
- February is the ""monday"" of months. I think I'll write a book! A book about a handsome, debonair cat who saved the world from alien invaders, ended war and solved world hunger.
- Nah.
- There are already too many autobiographies out there. The most important part of writing a book is picking a good title. I think I'll call mine ""Nights Of Indiscretion"".
- No, no. A writer must write something he knows about.
- That's it! I'll call it ""Nights Of Indigestion"". THAT'S IT!
- I have just come up with a cure for writer's cramp!
- Writer's block. Most kids love snow.
- Most kids love building forts and throwing snaowballs.
- Mine are out for world domination. If Oj'n not going to let us in, I say we break the door in!
- TAP
- It's tough building up a full head of steam in deep snow. Yes, Odie, I'd say that hook is fairly important.
- Z
- Z
- POOF
- CHOOM!
-
- ZOOM!
- I thought you were asleep! I was, my STOMACH wasn't. Garfield, you just had your morning nap. What are you doing back in bed? Taking your advice.
- You said, ""never put off until tomorrow what you can do today"".
- This is tomorrow morning's nap.
-
- Okay, I give. I was measuring the refrigerator for a pet door. It's fun finding familiar shapes in clouds.
- That one looks like Odie, same ears, same stupid expression...
- The same slobber.
- So, what's your problem, guys?
- We demand separate closets! Here I am again, pondering my existence.
- ...my relationship with the universe.
- ...my having eaten too much to move. I wish there were a sign to make you realize how fat you are, Garfield.
- RUMBLE RUMBLE
- And what does THAT tell you? That I shall be having my meals on the floor from now on. That's the last time I let you steer, Odie.
-
- Whee! I love snow. Yeah! As long as the neighbor kids don't spot us.
- SPLUT! SPLUT!
-
- Hey, cat! Give us the kitten and we'll let you live.
- NOT A CHANCE, YOU TURKEYS! IT'S ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR...
- all.
- CLICK!
- What is it, Garfield?! Is there a thief? Is the house on fire?! Worse! The light in the refrigerator is out! pant pant Odie drips so much maybe I should call a plumber!
-
- That's a figur eof speech, Garfield. drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
- SQUEAK
- Garfield, I hope you're not thinking of climbing my curtains.
- I wouldn't dream of climbing your stupid curtains, Jon.
- But, to be the first cat ever to lead an expedition up the southwest face of Mt. Everest, that's another matter! Climber's log: 12,000 feet up Mt. Everest and the going is slow.
- At this altitude oxygen is scarce. The experienced climber knows he must rest often.
- Z Now I've seen everything.
- That's my pie, Garfield, so HANDS OFF!
- PLOOT nnngh! You squished my banana.
- I have a blind date, tonight, what should I wear?
- Maybe I'll go with the rustic look...
- Or suave and sophisticated.
- Or she might go for the athletic type.
- DING! DONG! That's her! How do I look? Perfect.
- I'm Gwen. You're cute. God made two of 'em! You know, Garfield, maybe we should skip dessert tonight.
- SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP
- JON! SPEAK TO ME! YOU'RE DELIRIOUS, MAN! Thanks, I needed that. It says here, owners and their pets often look alike.
-
- I think I'll go shave. I think I'll go have plastic surgery done. Cats evoke many emotions in people...love, pleasure, wonder...
-
- and guilt. You know, before we start our meal, it might be nice to bow our heads and give thanks.
- Good idea.
- THANKS! PLOP You're missing the point, Garfield. Garfield, you're a disgrace to your species.
- Actually, I'm rather unique.
- I'm one of the few mammals who can breathe under food. Have some water, little fella.
- Now, I'll let you drain for a bit.
- I knoew this would happen if Jon didn't clean the garbage disposal. Come on, Odie, LIFT
- tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity
- What are you doing, Garfield? Guess!
- Are you dancing? Are you upset? Nope.
- Are you hungry? Guess AGAIN.
- Are you trying to warn me about something? You'll never guess.
- ARE YOU HORT?! Never in a million years.
- ARRRRGH! You're driving me crazy! Darn...you guessed. I hate mondays. Me, too.
- Why are YOU looking depressed? YOU don't work.
- Sympathy pains.
- They say, ""You are what you eat"".
- MOOOO Garfield, wake up.
- Do you know I can't remember the last time I heard you say ""Meow""?
- We'll talk about this in the morning. Jon doesn't have enough to occupy his mind. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
- MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
- May I get you a snorkel? Are you trying to tell me something? Welcome to ""Whistling For Dollars""!
- The world's most stupid and boring game show.
- Looks like the ""truth in advertising"" people struck again. AHA!
- Let's see you get out of this one gracefully.
-
- How do I look? Like a million, give or take a year.
- I think I carry my weight rather well. You should. You've had the practice.
- Do you think I'll loose my looks with age? With luck, you will.
- Do you think I have a strong chin? Which one?
- Thank you for your opinions, Nermal. Anytime.
- Anyone-Abu Dhabi Garfield, if a burglar broke into the house, would you risk your life to save me?
- Excuse me.
- HA! HA! HA! HA ha! ha! ha! Let me rephrase that. Irma, is this tea or coffee? What does it taste like?
- It tastes like turpentine.
- Oh, that's our coffee. Our tea tastes like transmission fluid. A philosopher once said, !I think; therefore I am"".
-
- Poor Odie, he isn't aware that he doesn't even exist. It says here, an active fantasy can improve your personality.
- I HAVE an active fantasy life.
- When I'm eating, I fantasize about sleep. When I sleep, I fantasize about eating. Garfield, have you ever imagined yourself as really young again? Interesting.
- Years of experience yet to be lived. Years of fun yet to be had.
- Years of sleep yet to be slept. munch munch munch
- BURP
- My compliments to the chief. And then my cat grabbed the steering wheel, and...
- YAWN
- I wish I could get to sleep.
- HOWDY! Who are you?
- I'm the sand person, I help folks go to sleep. Really?
- Yup. A few sprinkles of my magic sand and it's nighty night time. Lay it on me!
- HIT IT, CHARLEY!
- poof! Good morning, Garfield. I fixed you eggs, bacon, cinnamon rolls and hot coffee. Let me at 'em!
- WOAH!
- Rats. Nice try, Jon, You almost got me up on a monday that time. You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Arbuckle.
- Licking the beaters on a cake mixer can't possibly harm your cat.
- But, let's say that mixer was running at the time... KICK
- Why, Odie! Whatever gave you an idea like that?
- THIS is a kick! POMP! Garfield, if you're going to act like a piece of furniture, I'm going to treat you like a piece of furniture.
- Idle threats can't move me.
- Ha ha ha. Very funny, Jon. Garfield, let's just stay in today and lounge around.
- Okaaaay.
- I feel sorta silly, but I'll give it a shot.
-
- GARFIELD! Perfect timing. CRASH!
- Hey, Garfield, guess what?!
- We are going to roller-skate our way to health.
- NOW, LET'S GET OUT THERE AND DO IT!
- One side! Here comes your owner, the ""Roller Skate King!""
- AYIEEEEE! HONK! CRASH
-
- There goes my owner, the ""Roller Skate Hood Ornament"". You gotta take me to the vet, Jon.
- I'm having trouble sleeping, It seems like I just get into bed...
- And then, BOOM! Twelve or thirteen hours later I'm wide awake! COUGH! WHEEZE!
- This may be my last hour. Let me spend it in the comfort of my home!
- Remembe rthe vet appointment, huh? I may never see these four walls again! When I can't sleep, it seems like every sound in the house is magnified.
- THUD THUD THUD THUD THUD
- Must you?! Maybe a good book will help me sleep.
- A good, BIG book.
- whap whap whap Sleep! Sleep! Sleep! I know insomnia is no laughing matter, Garfield, so I'll keep you company.
- Let's see...I think I'll regale you with some anectdotes from my life as a boy on the farm.
- Z What's your favorite kind of music? Rock? Jazz? Classical?
- This way.
- WHIRRRRR Git down! Uh-huh, uh-huh!
- Hey, Odie. Let's put on a show for Jon.
- TAPPITY TAPPITY TAPPITY
- BLAT! SPLUT!
-
- Z
- RIP!CLAW SLASH FITTT GRRR!
- What did I do? BRINNNG!
- The worst part about being irritated by an inanimate object is there's no rational way to get back at it.
- Fortunately, I'm not a rational person. There's an old show biz saying, ""find out what your audience wants and give it to them"".
- BONK! SPLAT! WHAP!
- Apparently, my audience wants a target. Hello, Arlene, the cat of your dreams is here.
- You're a dream? You bet'cha, baby.
- I knew I shouldn't have eaten that pizza at bedtime. Ouch. Okay, Garfield, in ten seconds the timer will go off. click
- Capturing for posterity a portrait of a sophisticated young man and his faithful companion. whirrrr
- SNAP I think you're going to like this food, ferny.
- It's 100% fish meal accor...
- burp I swear, Garfield, you're a glutton who'll eat anything.
- I AM NOT A GLUTTON! AND THIS ISN'T JUST ANYTHING
- I am a performing artist and this is my repertoire. Howdy, ma'am! You new to these parts?
-
- BLUT
- MOMMIEEE!
- Oops!
- EEEEEK!
-
- YIP! YIP! YIP!
- WHI!!!!
- YAH! This is not a good day in the vanity department. Garfield, why don't you like to go outside like other cats?
- Right, like the time we went to the farm and I wrestled a chicken.
- You're hopeless. It was humiliating being pinned by ac chicken. So what's Mr. Excitement doing today? Collecting dust.
- I'm going jogging. Wanna go? Can't you see I'm busy?
- It would get your circulation going. Stop it! You're scaring the dust! Hey, Garfield, let's jog around the block. You'll get outside and give those lungs some exercise. No way.
- I'm beginning to worry about you!
- And close the door! I don't want any unnecessary air getting in here! Welcome to the early morning exercise show!
- Ready? And one! And two!
- Ha! Ha! Now you're getting it! It's easy to be cheery in the moring when you're prerecorded. Today I'm going to work on push-ups.
- UNNNGH
- So much for ""push"". Tomorrow we work on ""up"". This is what we need, Garfield. A complete entertainment system.
- It has something for everybody. Really?
- Then this must be where you warm up the pizza. CLICK
- CLICK CLICK CLICK
- CLICK CLICK CLICK
- GIMME THAT!
- CLICK Very well, Jon, have it your way.
- CLICK
- Speak softly and carry a big channel changer.
- You watch a lot of TV. Do you know that, Garfield?
- I can't read. What's your excuse? Boy are you fat!
- Hey, guys! Get a load of lardo here!
- WHUMP! It's been a nice day, Garfield.
- A peaceful day.
- Which will end abruptly if you stop scratching my belly. From now on I expect you to keep your area clean, Garfield.
- So I bought you this little broom.
- Where's the little maid to go with it? They say dogs have a strong sense of smell.
- POOMP!
- Fortunately, they can't smell a kick coming. Radar detects an edible substance on the surface, sir!
- Up periscope!
- Are you trying to make me jealous?
- Come to breakfast, Garfield.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
- How's your coffee, Garfield?
- Not bad. Good. Those tonsils will have to come out, Mr, Arbuckel I'm putting you in the hospital. Okay, doc. Hospitel?
- JON! DON'T GO! How touching, a cat who's concerned about his owner.
- WHO'S GOING TO FEED ME?!! Aunt Gussie will take care of you while I'm in the hospitel having my tonsils removed.
- Aunt Gussie?! Oh, great! Oh, come on. She's a sweet old lady.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant the same aunt Gussie who was kicked out of the marines for unnecessary roughness! I miss Jon, Odie. Let's go visot him in the hospital.
-
- And while we're there, we'll see if they can reverse lobotomies. Good boy, Mr. Arbuckle! I see we cleaned our plate.
- She's mistaken. Nobody can stomach hospital food with the possible exception of...
- You were expecting maybe Dr. Schweitzer? What kind of a hospital is this, Jon? click
- The television doesn't work. click click click
- And how can you sleep on that bed? How was your tonsillectomy, Jon?
- I can barely swallow. Awww, poor baby.
- Maybe I have your ice cream? It's another ""hurts to move"" morning.
-
- Hello, what's this?
- A shoe, a single shoe.
- Why is it you find only one shoe in the trash? One shoe on a sidewalk? One shoe in the street?
- Why don't people pitch shoes in Paris?!
- KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK We'll just find out.
- Yes? Never mind. Good morning, Garfield. How did you sleep?
- Like this.
- Z I see.
- SPLOT
- I keep forgetting...it's wake up first, THEN eat. Why don't you go outside, Garfield? The fresh air will do you good.
- Maybe Jon's right.
- Z Garfield, I don't understand.
- Cats are supposed to be sleek and vital.
- What happened to you? My great-uncle Ralph was a wart hog. ROWF! ROWF! ROWF!
- Uh-oh! SCREEEEE
- Miss me? Relentless in his pursuit of food, the shark scours the ocean floor.
- Above him he spies the shadowy silhouette of a life raft with a lone survivor!
-
- Z
- Z
- Odie looks like he's dreaming about chasing something. Z
- Let's see if he catches it. Z
- ZIP!
- CRASH!
- Yup.
- He caught the heat register. Z The neighbors asked me to baby-sit for their fern.
- There instructions shouldn't be too difficult.
- ""Step one: watering, see section 26, paragraph 12"". Skip the step that says, ""cats eat fern"". See you later, Garfield. I have to pick up spring water and fertilizer. Boy, is Jon spoiling that fern.
- I require only the simple things in life, like a long nap in a warm sunbeam.
- This has got to stop. ARRRRGH! Burp.
- You ate the neighbor's prize fern! What an I going to do now?!
- I understand they're doing some splendid things with plastic these days. Not again?
- Garfield? Are you eating in here? CLICK
- Nobody here but us refrigerator magnets. That's it! Gimme that remote control, Garfield. click click click
- GULP
- GARFIELD! click click Life just isn't fair, is it, Jon?
-
- I can see today is going to be a real yawn a minute. Even the Caped Avenger requires special effects.
-
- Z
- click!
- That's it! I'm tired of living with you bozos!
- I'm moving out an taking my stuff with me.
- How's apartment life, Garfield? With the exception of one nosy neighbor, not bad. Wake up, Garfield, Today is the first day of the rest of you life.
-
- Wake up, Garfield, Today is the first MEAL of the rest of your life. I can't resist a nicely turned phrase. How do you want your eggs this morning, boys, too salty or too greasy?
- I'm tired of the same choice. Could you burn them? I'll try.
- You're a peach, Irma! Garfield, would you know what happened to my loaf of garlic bread? Why ask me?
- droop
- Rat fink daisies! May I have this cupcake, PLEASE? Very well, you may have it.
- What's the problem, Garfield?
- I don't know if I want only a one ""please"" cupcake. Give me your honest opinion, Garfield.
- Do you think this outfit clashes? No.
- It's waging all-out war.
- One thing I like about lethargy...
- You don't have to work at it. I hate it when I don't tan all over.
-
-
- chink! whizzzzzzz
- ZIP! CHOMP
- Sigh. Good morning, boys and girls! Good morning, Uncle Roy!
- I love you just the way you are! I love you too, uncle Roy!
- Of course, you could stand to lose a little weight... CLICK I wonder what Binky The Clown is up to? Good morning, boys and girls! I love you just the way you are! I love you too, Uncle Roy.
- Golly. I feel good today! And do you know why? Why?
- Because I have so many wonderful friends like you! Translation: Uncle Roy's ratings are up. Why, here comes Mr. Blue Jeans, the mailman. Morning, Mr. Blue Jeans. Any mail for me?
- You, Uncle Roy, here's a black tax notice and a copy of Leather and Bike Magazine.
- And here's a letter from you ex-wife's lawyer... This is a side of Uncle Roy I haven't seen before. Let's take a walk in my neighborhood, boys and girls. Would you like that? Sure, Uncle Roy.
- Here we are outside my hou... HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- HELP! BLINKY THE CLOWN'S STEALING MY HUBCAPS! It must be ratings week. Hi, boys and girls! I love you just the way you are! I love you too, Uncle Roy!
- I'm in this cast today thanks to Binky The Clown who mugged me yesterday. But that's okay, because I love him just the way he is...
- BEHIND BARS! Uncle Roy's only human, I guess. Do you know how to spot a lazy person?
- A truly lazy person never finishes any...
- Z Do you think the wizard will give me a brain? You didn't tell me you had family here, Odie.
- Hey, Odie.
- Is that your tongue or did you swallow a pair of Long Johns?
-
- By the way, I heard your fleas died of food poisoning.
- Oh, yes, Igor called. He said your brain is on back order.
-
- Look, Odie, if I don't get a reaction, I'm gonna have to get personal. Here you go, Garfield. That's milk.
- It'll make your coat nice and shiny. I think I'll opt to molt.
- All cats love milk! When I was young I was frightened by an udder. Back, fleas! Look! A flea collar!
- POW! PING
- Some fool sold them guns! Nice shot, Ralph! You know, Garfield, I've often wondered...
- Which are smarter? Cats? Or dogs?
- Speaking of dogs, where's Odie? He's fishing off the back of you rowing machine. I hate playing hide-and-seek with Odie. I've been in this basket for an hour.
- Maybe I shouldn't have found such a good hiding place.
- Or maybe I shouldn't have made Odie count to three. Hello? What's this?
- clickety clickety clickey
- Sensing an error in judgement, our hero slowly backs away...
- OUCH!
- You wouldn't happen to know how this hole got in here would you? Rare oven mitt-eating moths, I suspect. This is Odie-wan-Kanobe. He has the force to help us. He hides it well.
-
- EEEK!
- HELP! HWLP! HELP!
-
- Garfield, you sissy. I can't believe you're afraid of a little spider.
- I need your book.
- FWAP
- Thank you very much.
- EEEK! Goody! Here comes the mailman for his daily chomp.
- Wait! He's stopping.
- NO FAIR!
- ARF! ARF! arf! arf! arf!
- Thank you, Mr. Stealth! YOU ARE LAZY!
- Don't you have any goals in life? Yes, to eat an ostrich.
- Don't you wanna climb that mountain and yell, ""I made it""? Ambition gives me a nosebleed. You never move from that spot. Ah. But I've considered it.
- You're not even a cat.
- YOU'RE A SLUG WITH HAIR! Sure, kick me when I'm down! Jon called me a slug with hair. Well, I'm not taking it lying down!
-
- All right, I'll take it lying down. But, I won't like it. From now on you're earning your keep around here. Here's a list of chores. Gee, thanks!
- Only moments ago I was a lazy worthless burden of society.
- Now I'm a procrastinator. Well, who had the keys last, deputy?
-
- Uh, Jon, you know how curious cats are, don't you?
- Well, I sorta found you car keys on the chest and Odie and I...uh, well...
- What are you trying to tell me, Garfield?
- VRMM
- CRASH
- Never mind. Tell me, Jon, is it bad when the headlights are staring at one another? Yawn
- SHUFFLE SCRAPE SCRAPE SHUFFLE I was afraid of this.
- My birthday is creeping up on me. Garfield, I know you're depressed about your upcoming birthday...
- But, remember you're only as old as you feel.
- Let's see...how old are you going to be? About 12 million years old, give or take a millenium. In a few years I'll be ten years old. Just what IS ten?
-
- Ten is two hands and two toes. Why am I afraid of turning ten?
- Why am I afraid to admit that I'm aging?
- And why are turkey buzzards circling my bed? Garfield, you'll soon be ten years old.
- And people handlse aging differently.
- Have you considered acting gracefully? I refuse to get any older without a fight! Do you hear that?!
- You'll have to drag me kicking and screaming into my next year.
- After the birthday cake and presents, of course. If you brought me presents you may stay.
- Hey, Garfield, I just ran across the old family album. Ho boy.
- Our only thought is to entertain you. Feed me. Show me a good mouser, and I'll show you a cat with bad breath. We're inseparable, aren't we, Garfield? You're standing on my tail.
- When I want in, I want it NOW.
- It's not the valleys in life I dread so much as the dips.
- DO IT TO ME NOW, MONDAY! GET IT OVER WITH! When there's napping to do around here, I'll do it.
- You've really changed in ten years, Garfield. Feed me. Ten?! Why you don't look ten!
- You look...
- You look like you're trying to convince yourself that you don't look ten. Starting today, I think younger!
- CRACK SNAP POP POP POP CRACK SNAP POP
- That goes for you too, bonies. Guess what we're going to do today?
- Here's a hintr. I start by hitting something with a club.
- We're going to play golf! Thank goodness. I thought he was getting desperate for a date. This is a pretty tricky putt, Garfield.
- Which way do you think it will break? Hmmm
- I'd say, right.
- I've heard of tough golf courses...
- But quicksand traps? GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! SLUUUCK!
- I', slucking the cheese off your lasagna. SLUUUCK!
- You're slucking the cheese of my lasagna. Nothing escapes this man. Do you expect me to be seen in public with you dressed like that?
- CLICK
- Why do I stay up and watch those old horror movies?
- What if there's a monster under my bed?
- That's silly. A monster couldn't fit under there.
- Unless of course, it's a real thin monster.
-
- The sun should be up soon. One thing you can say about Odie...
- He'll never have a mental breakdown.
- No moving parts. Aha! Girl scouts and their cookies approach!
- Halt! I see broken branches and cat tracks. There's a cat ambush up ahead!
- Rats! A girl scout scout. Look, mommy.
- Psst psst psst No, Johnny, it isn't!
- It doesn't have a trunk. Diet time.
- What's the matter, Garfield? Lost your appetite? Sort of...
- it took another look at dinner and went into hiding. Garfield, no tricks, just honesty, I'm taking you to the vet for a checkup.
- You're right, Jon. Honesty is important in a relationship.
- SPLUT! NO, YOU'RE NOT. Doc, is Garfield's heart okay? Yes. Are his eyes okay? Yes.
- Are his teeth okay? Yes. Are his ears okay? Yes.
- Will you go out with me tonight? no. hope springs eternal. That's not a lasagna, mate, THIS is a lasagna!
- Z
- Whoa, Simba! Z
- Why, it's an ancient ruin of a human being.
- WHUMP! Let's unearth this relic, Sibma.
- This must be a hand which is used to prepare food.
- And these must be feet that carried it to thr kitchen.
- All right! I'll fix breakfast! The pickax won't be necessary, Simba. YAWN
- CHONK
- Hellooooo, monday. How in the world am I gonna get out of this?
- Maybe if I just closed my mouth...
- I relly don't think this is exactly the way to get me down, Odie.
- Why don't you try something else?
-
- Congratulations, Odie! You did something right for a change!
- TOING!! Well, Odie, you almost broke any bone in my body, but you did get me down from the tree.
- Someday I hope to do the same for you.
- But not today. Oh sure, this may look comfortable.
- But it has its risks.
- Lip splinters are no laughing matters. HEE HA HA HA HEE HEE HA HA HA HEE HA
- And now let's play ""The Brain Game"".
- Here's our quiz question. Be the first person to call with the correct answer and win a new house! Right, I'll just pick up the phone and tall you the answer.
- If you were a felis domesticus, what kind of sound would you make? Felis domesticus? That's a house cat!
- beep beep boop beep boop
- For a new house, what is your answer? Meow.
- Meow is correct! Congratulations! I WON! I WON! I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
- Just give us your name and address, and we'll get right on you.
- Uh, and how do you spell your name, Mr. Aaarrrggh? Garfield starts a new diet today.
- This also marks the first day of...
- Cheating. Yawn
- UNNGH!
- Diet time, Garfield. Shut up and get me a shoehorn. Not another carrot! I know it's diet week, but anything would taste better than this!
- Oh, well. MUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH
- Burp...not bad. That was a great little nap. scratch scratch
- Oh, what the heck?
- They're small. I'll take two.
- WHAM!
- Garfield! Dinner! I'd love to, but my lips are stuck in the mail slot. Tennis is one of my favorite sports. Do you have a favorite sport, Garfield?
-
- Natch.
- Now for a nice evening of television.
- BLIP! Rats! We must've blown a fuse!
- Garfield, use your cat instincts to guide me to the basement.
- OUCH!..HEY! Where are you leading me?
- I think we're in the basement. Never mind. We'll sleep right here till it gets light.
- Well, Mr. Scout, what do we do now? I hate it when he wakes up cranky. Bathrooms are fun.
- Here's a new one.
- VIP! YIP! YIP! The mummy lives.
-
- GARFIELD! CREEEEEEEK
- Th emummy awakens from a sleep of 3000 years.
- And sets his snooze alarm for another century. Boy, am I starved.
- I wonder what mummies eat?
- * I remember breakfast back home.
- Lying in bed. The smell of bacon on the griddle...
- The sound of mom giggling as she made patterns in the potato pancakes with my baby shoes. She's a disturbed woman. On your mark...
- Get set...
- PLOP Z I, Garfield, Prince of Chraming, hve just awakened you with a kiss. It wasn't the kiss. It was the smell of sardines and pumpernickel on your breath.
-
- hee hee hee
- YAAAH!
-
-
- EEEEK!!!
- That would have been funnier had his brain not been in another time zone. RIIINNNGGG!
- Better hit the ol' snooze alarm. RIIINNG!
- SNNOORE I wish Jon would get off my back.
- He says I'm not pulling my weight around here.
- boing! picky, picky, picky. Garfield, you're tha laziest cat I know. You never met my grandfather.
- He was too lazy to get up to eat.
- He'd lie on the floor and throw his dentures at the refrigerator. I'm not appreciated out here.
- AAAYIEEEE!!!
- I spend all morning greasing his shoes and not even a thank you. Do you know how to tell the difference between a raisin cookie and a chocolate chip cookie?
- POOEY!
- Neither do I. You fell off the curtains. So much for mountain climbing.
- I thought cats are supposed to land on their feet. So much for myth.
- CATS DON'T LAND ON THEIR FEET! So much for mystique. One for me and all for me. Does that sound right to ypu?!
- bat bat bat
- bat bat bat
- ZIP FWAP FWAP FWAP
- That's a familiar sound.
- We've gotta put a stop to this, Garfield.
- *
- There, this venetian blind should do the trick.
- ZIP CHU-CHUNG
-
- Dear Mom, How are you?
- everything's the same here...
- We need more fuit. I'm sorry to say. There are many ways to deal with depression.
- Some people buy a new hat.
- In order to depress others. Morning, Garfield. Have a good sleep?
- It was a decent sleep, even a better-than-average sleep.
- A sleep, perhaps, thet the uninitiated might think a first-rate sleep, but not a sleep that we conoisseurs would consider... I'm sorry I asked! So, what'll it be? Door number one?
- Door number two, or door number three?
- How about channel number four? CLICK drip drip drip drip
- CLICK
- CLICK drip drip drip drip We'll be back right soon so please don't touch that dial.
- HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
- I SAAAAID, ""DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL""! Talk about ratings through intimidation. This is great, Jon. What are you going to have?
- *
- Hey, Garfield.
- Did you know muscles earn you respect?
- Did you know chicks go crazy over guys with big muscles?
-
-
- Did you know you can flex fat? Garfield, all you're good for is lying around and collecting dust. You got it.
- I don't suppose you'd like to exercise with me? You got it again.
- Well, taht's fine with me! Thank you. This is it, little buddy. Today I start weight training and take my first step toward hunkhood!
- UNNNNGH!
- HYAH! My hero. You know, Garfield, exercise really pays. Not enough.
- Know what I got from lifting weights? A hernia?
- Rippling biceps!
- That reminds me. How about spaghetti for dinner? UNNNGH!
- BWOIK!
- Very funny! Weight lifing has really helped me, Garfield!
- Just look at that muscle! Oooo, let me feel!
- You killed it! The poor thing was sick. You're looking trim these days, Mr. Arbuckle.
- What's your secret? Diet? Exercise?
- Garfield started sleeping on my stomach. That should do it. Why don't you guys get off my case?
-
- Tell you what, Garfield, If I give you one of my hamburgers, will you stop staring at me? Agreed!
-
- YAWN
- * Morning, Garfield, **
- * You coffee's on the table * Garfield, your snoring kept me up half the night.
- You didn't stop until six A.M. I know.
- That's when I inhaled my blanket. SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK I guess I'd better get my shoes off.
- SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK
- I guess I'd better wash my socks. Oh, yuk! I must have been hungry last night, Jon.
- I dreamt I was eating flowers, millions of 'em.
- What are you trying to say, Garfield? You're missing some wallpaper. KLUNK KLUNK KLONK
- Sigh.
- It's tough to fluff a bed-box. Starting today, I'm going to work on being more peasant.
- BOOT!
- Have a nice day! GARFIELD! Who else?
- Hmmm
- You are about to witness my finest hour.
- Garfield, you are a genius.
- Ah, customers!
- Oh, Brett! This is perfect! I love it!
- You're right, Mona. A little paint and some wallpaper and we'll more right in. A little wha?!
- WHA...? It's a long story. If I ruled the world, do you know what I would do? I know what I would do.
- I would make all people live in harmony. I would eat lasagna till it came out my nose.
- And I would make cats stop being so self-serving. And dogs would be outlawed! Here comes the scariest part of the movie.
- I CAN'T LOOK! TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER!
- Was it scary? Not bad. Here's a picture of me back on the farm.
- Things were really tough then.
- Here's dad trying to milk a pig. That explains a lot. Here's a picture of my brother and me. Boy we were pretty wild.
- An night we'd sneak out of our room...
- Then we'd fill our shoes with chicken feed and run through the henhouse! Two real fugitives from justice. This is ridiculous.
- You're so finicky.
- There, all the ends are tied together. One-slurp spaghetti. George! That cat is at the window again!
- Don't worry, Martha. He can't get in here. What's that noise?!
- skreeeeee Sounds like a glass cutter! Call the police! Not to fear, friar Odie. I've done this a hundred times, so I'm bound to get it right sooner or later.
- Z
-
- Z
- BRINNNNG!
- Come here, you little...and I'll rip your hands off.
-
- BRINNG!
- I assume there's an explanation. Careful, Jon! They travel in pairs. Do we have any potato chips left, Garfield?
- I'll check.
- Nope. Good morning, Garfield. A rookie!
- I've heard a lot about you. I'm famous!
- They say you're vicious! Let me autograph your leg. ARR ARR ARR ARR ARR ARR ARR Dogs are stupid.
- SLAP SLAP SLAP With bad breath.
- SNAP Bu, I love'em anyway. Good morning, Garfield. 'morning, Jon.
- What's this meatball doing in your bed? I put one there every night.
- That's weird. He must not believe in the spaghetti fairy. The trouble with you, Garfield, is you think you're human.
- You're right.
- I gotta do something about this inferiority complex. Look! A mouse!
- Act like a cat, Garfield! Okay.
- Z Whew! I was beginning to think I'd never get full. BURP!
- Lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-laaaaaahhh
- I hope the writer's strike ends soon.
- And now, back to the Binky the Clown show!
- HEEEEEEEY, KIDS!!! Good morning, Binky!
- It's a beautiful day in Binkyland. Let's say hello to Mr, Sun! Hello, Mr. Sun.
- Oh look! Here comes Mr. Fish to visit us!
- Good morning, Mr. Fish. Kids, can you say hello to...
- AAAYIEEEEE!!! Hello, Mr. Piranha. whirrrrrrrrr Garfield, where are you? By the electric pencil sharpener being bored.
- And just what are we doing? We are seeing which common household objects can hold a point. We're bored. You said it.
- Hey, I have an idea!
- Well, we're not bored anymore. You're right. We're bored AND stupid looking. Depressed, Garfield? Yo.
- Well, look on the bright side.
- Compared to absolute, hopeless despair, depressed is cheerful! I feel better already. Garfield, you have to be the world's laziest cat!
- ALL RIGHT!
- This boy's priorities are badly misplaced. Howdy, stranger.
- Garfield, I hate to tell you this...
- But, sleeping next to a picture of the Grand Canyon is not camping out. You're standing in my camp fire! Ha-ha! The last doughnut and it's all mine!
- Why are you smiling, Garfield?
- I already licked the sugar off. Hey! This tastes like baby powder. This painting of you is lacking something, Garfield. Yeah, a resemblance.
-
- Garfield, are you lying on my sandwich? You might say that.
- Hey, misterm may we bury your cat in the sand? Sire, go ahead.
- Thanks, mister. You're in trouble. Have fun, kids.
- I must admit this is kind of relaxing.
- This sand feels so cool...
- Okay, Susie, you stay here. I'll go get the ants. LIFEGUARD! That's strange. I forgot why I came in here.
- Oh well. It will occure to me later.
- Hopefully before he gets to the grocery store. Here's the news! ...uh! Gee, this is small print.
- Unfortunately, I can't see a thing without my glasses.
- SO here's a song! * Feeeliiiiings * You should see the weather tap-dance.
-
- In case you're interested, watches don't float. Hey, Garfield! Let's go to the beach! Not today.
- Where's your spirit of adventure?
- The spirit is willing but the flesh is fat. There must be some way to escape this fat.
-
- Nah, it would just find my forwarding address. Ready to order, hon? What?s your special today, Irma?
- ""Chicken Surprise"". Great. We'll take two.
- SURPRISE! SURPRISE! You distract her. I'll call the hospital. Got it. It's too early in the morning for ""cute"".
-
- Cats are the greatest hunters on earth.
- Watch me sneak up on that bird.
- Cats are silent stalkers, deftly stepping between the dry leaves.
- Remaining absolutely motionless, cats wait for the perfect moment to lunge...
- DIE BIRD!
- Stupid plastic flamingo. Here's a famous phrase for you, Garfield.
- ""Curiosity killed the cat"". My uncle Bernie coined that one.
- Right afte rhe coined the phrase, ""never listen for a train by putting your ear on a train track"". Winter of '83, summer of '79, spring of '86.
- I love these trips down memory lane...
- Checking the expiration dates in Jon't refrigerator. Dressing properly is a art, Garfield.
- Rule number one, a tie is the extension of one's personality.
- Rule number two, never tuck your shirt into your underwear. Have you noticed how Odie is always smiling, Garfield? His parents were hyenas.
- Why don't you ever smile? I have my reasons.
- If he thought he were pleasing me, he'd stop trying. Maybe Garfield won't eat THIS fern.
- Do you know what this is? I sure do.
- It's the triumph of hope over experience. Stay tuned.
- coming up next is some mindless drivel guaranteed to insult your intellect.
- Jon! Your show's on! Definitely no more pizzas with anchovies and chocolate syrup before bedtime.
-
-
- CRASH!
-
- CRASH!
-
- I meant to do that.
-
- He actually moved. One side was getting flat. Jon! You're home!
- Good to see you!
- Where's the candy bar I had in my pocket?
- GARFIELD! CUT THAT OUT!
- Cut what out? Bird Feeder
- You might be interested to know while YOU were asleep, I caought a mouse.
- Good boy. JON! JON! ODIE'S FOAMING AT THE MOUTH!
- MAD DOG! MAD DOG!
- By the way, you're out of shaving cream. I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU! I MUST KISS YOU!
- Kiss! Kiss! Smooch! Kiss! Kiss!
- Oh, baby, baby! Car commercial. My crystal ball tells me I'm going to have fish for lunch.
- OH NO!
- GARFIELD! YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME!
- I'm late for my date! Which socks should I wear?
- My shirt! Does it go with my socks?!
- TIES! I HAVE TOO MAY TIES!
- THERE ARE TOO MANY DECISIONS TO MAKE!
- Yeah, decisions like, should I enjoy this, or, should I tell him his date is tomorrow night? I just can't ge tmotivated today, Garfield. Don't fight it.
- There's so much work to do. Ignore it, it'll go away.
- I've been bitten by the lazy bug. I ate him. Jon't driving me crazy.
- He's trying to grow a beard.
- Do I look distiguished yet? Welcome to the family. Here's a new diet, Garfield.
- It's called the ""Ramone Diet"".
- If you overeat, this guy named ""Ramone"" comes by and fattens your lips.
- Crude, but effective. You cats hardly have a care in the world, do you?
- Your biggest worry is probably about the pet door sticking and your getting caught outside.
- Hey, Garfield. Here comes the mailman.
- Looks like you won't be able to shred his pants today.
- He's wearing shorts. Then I'll just have to pluck a few leg hairs. What's this? It's from the pudding-of-the-month club.
- I don't recall joining any club.
- Do you, Garfield? Dibs on the butterscotch! This space for rent GARFIELD Jon has no sense of humor.
-
- unscrew unscrew unscrew
- SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE
- Good morning, Garfield.
- PLOP
- GOOSH!
- Garfield! One more trick and no more TV for a week!
- Uh, about your croissant. Dieting is like show business.
-
- The weight always returns for an encore.
- WHIP
- A little sensitive about our weight, are we? My weight, my business. Cut that out, Garfield.
- If you don't stop staring at me, I'm leaving the room!
- THERE! HAPPY?! Quite. Garfield, watching you eat takes me back to my farm days. snort gulp slurp
- We raised hogs. slurp gulp snort
- SQUEEE! SQUEEE! How would you like cat food shoved up your snout? Go away, dog. You're washing the wax off my shoes.
- Don't you understand English?
- Is your dog one of them foreign breeds? No, he's one of them mindless breeds. Wanna go jogging, Garfield? No thanks.
- A new report says that too much air can prematurely age your lungs.
- I'm going. Well, don't come crying to me with wrinkled lungs. Wanna look thinner? Hang around with people fatter than you.
-
- The cat senses the approach of danger.
- rrrrr
- The dog approaches, bent on wreaking havoc on the cat.
- AR! AR! AR! AR! AR! AR! The dog threatens to dismember the cat.
- The cat bares a perfunctory claw.
- YIP! The dog flees, fearing for his life.
- Another searing episode in the life and death struggles of house pets. Time to get up, Garfield. Go away.
- Come on, Mr. Grumpy, rise and shine!
- Never touch ""Mr. Grumpy"" before noon.
- Rats. I hate static electricity.
- So do I. Garfield, this toy was designed by animal psychologists.
- TO appeal to a house pet's playful instincts.
- DOING DOING Enjoy. Three sardine cans...
- Four cupcake wrappers. a pizza box...
- Why, Garfield?
- Because breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And now, the late, late, late show presents...
- ""Night of the Zombie Plumbers"" in 3-D!
- I've been up too long. Congratulations, Garfield! You've mastered the chopsticks!
- Now, dive in!
- GULP! Nope...I've not seen him, marshal.
-
-
- ZIP!
-
- ZIP!

- Good morning, Garfield. Paste SWIPE
- PUNT!
- Odie? That's it! I'm fed up with Jon! I'm fed up with Odie! I can't think of a single thing I like about this house!
-
- The roof...I'm rather fond of the roof. Z
- Z
- Z HEE HEE HEE Time for bed, Garfield. Z
- I said, time for bed. Z
- When he sleeps, he sleeps. Z Hello? Dr. Wilson?
- Yes, I'm afraid it's Garfield again.
- He chewed the knobs off the TV during a pizza commercial. I'm only human. Tah-dah!
- What's with you?
- You'd think he'd be more impressed with someone who just ate the entire contents of a house. Hey! Where did the refrigerator go? The big dripper.
- DINNERTIME!
- Hungry, Garfield? Is Odie stupid?
- Great! let's go to the refrigerator and find something to eat.
- Come on, Odie. Don't do it, Jon!
- I'd better go to the rescue.
-
- SLAM! Clean out the refrigerator, Jon! Good evening, ladies and germs! tappity tappity
- SPLAT! BOP! WHAP!
- I see some of you stayed for the second show. I knew a dog who was so stupid, he chased bones and buried cars!
- ROWF! BARK! MEOW! YIP GRRR ARF!
- Dog Pound Who booked me into this joint anyway? * MEROWW * TINK!
- Hey! A caviar tin!
- I'm attracting a higher class of hecklers! You know, Garfield, we're not getting any younger.
- Maybe we should start planning for our future. You're right.
- Where are we going? TO make up a grocery list. I like it when I'm home alone.
- The entire house is MINE.
- And this is MINE, and this is MINE, and this is MINE... I didn't know you could touch your toes, Garfield. And you thought I was out of shape.
-
- Are you okay? Don't just stand there, All the paramedics!
- Garfield, I've always wondered, what do you do with all the raisins you pick off your cookies? That's none of your business.
- Oh well, I guess I'll go clean out the coat closet today. I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- YAAAAHHH!!!
- Very funny, Garfield.
- Just look at the mess you've made!
- Now I'll have to get a broom out of the broom closet to clen this up. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Any specials today, Irma?
- I'll check.
- Hey, Bubba! Anything in the trap this morning? Check please. What's the soup of the day? Hoboy.
- Well now, what day IS today? Tuesday.
- Well then, that would make it TUESDAY'S soup, wouldn't it now? Makes sense to me. Here's your burger. plop
- Uh, don't I get a bun?
- Oh! You want our DELUXE burger! Go for it, Jon! Get the super deluxe and get a plate, too. GARFIELD! WAIT!
- Most kinds of spiders are completely harmless. Jon...you're right.
- Especially the dead kinds! WHAP! Garfield, I don't feel like scratching your belly.
- I have better things to do.
- Like mending your shredded shirt?
- BOMP!
- I love volleydog. That's the last time I hide pet snacks on my person.
-
- Some pets are well behaved, and then there are my pets. I can't leave them alone for a second, watch this.
- So long, boys! I'll only be gone for a second!
- One.
- I rest my case.
-
- It's going to be one of those mondays. pick pick pick pick
- Do you know what you get when you pick the raisins off your toast?
- Swiss toast! brrrrrr . Is it me, or is the hous freezing this morning?
- TINK TINK It ain't me. And here's a photo of you with the pigs on my folk's farm last summer.
-
- You're the one with the stripes. Boy, this exercising is tough.
- It's giving me a headache.
- Try loosening your sweatband. I can't believe Judy asked us to leave her party.
- By the way, what were you doing in the salad bowl? Bobbing for croutons.
- Boy was she mad. You'd think she'd never had hair on her tomato wedges before. 35 days, 5 hours, 36 minutes and 4 seconds till Christmas.
- CLICK
- Z
- Z Wha? Who?! Are you a monster?!
- SLURP! Odie! It's you! Sure, you can sleep with me.
- Yaaah! Now who are YOU?!
- CLICK GARFIELD!
- What are you trying to do? Scare us? What a great meal!
- Isn't it a shame there's no unit of measure for how good food tastes? Ah, but there is...
- It's called a calorie. Do you think you'd ever like to have a statue erected in your memory, Garfield?
- Yeah!
- If they could make it so it could eat pigeons. Wait'll you see what I bought, Garfield.
- TAH-DAH!
- It's amazing the things people would rather have than money. I wonder what Garfield is doing with that salad dressing?
-
- KEEP AWAY FROM THE FERNS! Too late. Tell me, Garfield. Would you say this milk shake is half full or half empty?
- Completely empty!
- Care to get philosophical about those french fries? Dinner's on, Garfield. Oh, nothing for me, thanks. I'm not hungry.
-
- WHO ARE YOU, AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH GARFIELD?! That was a joke. WAH!
- Hey, Odie!
- Fetch, boy!
- DONK PLOP
- SHOOM!
- Odie, you stupid idiot! That's a fire hydrant! Not a bone!
- Oh well, maybe this will make a nice planter or something. squeak squeak
- I don't even want to know.
-
- My Captain Lamo laser poweres direction finder, decode ring! I hate cats. And now! ...your favorite game show!
- Bowling for cheese! Uh-oh!
- The audience is small, but loyal. Hey, look. The mailman's hand is stuck in the mailbox.
- How tragic.
- How sad. Z
- OUCH! Your eyebrows needed thinning. Don't you just love all this snow, Garfield?
- You and Odie should be romping about having the time of your lives.
- Where is he anyway?
- I'm standing on him.WHEW, GARFIELD!
- YOUR MORNING BREATH IS AWFUL. You're telling me.
- My teeth melted. I've got to stop dieting. I gain too much weight.
- Read yto go out, guys? Ask me again in the spring.
- Have fun in the snow, boys.
- SLAM!
- FOOMP!
-
-
- Odie! Are you okay?
- ARRRRGH!
- Wimp. Gee, I can't decide whether to have some pie or some cake.
-
- Have some pie. Jon, there's a lump in the tablecloth. Flatten it out with this french bread.
-
- Wait a minute! Where's Odie` Who's Odie? Look, Garfield! I'm touching my toes! I'm happy for you, Jon.
- This is great exercise. Why don't you join me? Sounds a bit strange, but, okay.
- Jon, I have something to tell you.
- The refrigerator stopped running so I ate all the food before it spoiked.
- Somebody unplugged the refrigerator! I know. As a joke, I have tied Jon's shoelaces together. Z
- And, as a bonus joke, I have attached this rope to an airliner about to leave for Italy.
- WHA! SHOOP! Bring back pizza! Garfield? What happened to the cookies I had in this jar?
-
- That was a stupid question. I'll say. Wanna popsicle, Jon?
- Ho-hum.
- What a boring, dreary existence this is.
- GRRRR
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- RRRRRRRR
-
- What a boring, dreary existence this is. I have a big date tonight, Garfield.
- Do you think I'll make a good impression?
- Good, no. Accurate, yes. Boy, am I sleepy.
- YAWN
- I think I saw the sweat sock I lost last week. Boy, am I bored...bored, bored, bored, bored.
- It's sure a quiet day.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet day. Ah, yes. There it is. That old Christmas spirit is in the air once again.
- What would you like for breakfast, Garfield? A blueberry waffle, please.
- AND A CAR, A PONY AND A VILLA IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE! That's right. Stay just like that, Odie.
- * Oh, Joooon *
- I Get the hint, Garfield. Subtle as it is. Look, Odie. We may have a white Christmas after all.
- Wait a minute! That looks like feathers!
- MY PILLOW! Scrooge. Jon, I think it was a mistake to bring Odie.
- YAWN
- Why, thank you, Garfield.
- Odie! You fixed breakfast! How sweet.
- Thanks, Garfield. It's a bit drafty in here.
- Uh, thank you, Odie.
- SCREEEEE
- By the way, boys, this attention wouldn't have anything to do with Christmas coming up, would it? I just ground this coffee with my teeth. Well, Garfield, it's that time of year again! Time to wash your socks?
- Time to get a Christmas tree!
- What's wrong with the one we have? I got our Christmas tree. Close the door, will yuh?
- SLAM!
- I meant AFTER I got the tree in! You should have been more specific. Well, there it is, Garfield.
- The most beautiful Christmas tree ever...
- Once again, the law of gravity rears its ugly head.
- Z
- Only three days 'til Christmas. Go back to bed, Garfield. *

- Urf! I love you, Garfield! I wish it would never end. Merry Christmas! Jim Davis 12.25 BRINNNG!
- DONK
- Only 364 more days till Christmas! GARFIELD! HEY, GARFIELD!
- What's your new year's resolution?
- You just woke me from it! Garfield, you should start the year out on the right foot. Which one? I have som any.
- You should resolve to lose weight. I tried that last year.
- I lost my resolve instead. I'm going to make a new year's resolution!
- This year, I resolve to...
- Pay attention to where I point.
- This year, I resolve to be gentler with Odie!
- push A new year's resolution.
- Eating will no longer be a vice of mine.
- Henceforth, it will be a hobby.
- Garfield! You missed my new year's party! Define, ""party"".
- Well, we had a great time without you. Bobbing for seedless grapes in fruit punch isn't my idea of a great time.
- I suppose you went to some wild blowout. That's what the SWAT team called it.
- WE PLAYED PIN THE TAIL ON THE DONKEY We played pin the tail on the host.
- Things got pretty out of hand when Mr. Beasley turned the Polka record up to 78 RPM! Whoa, fella! Spare my sensibilities!
- Oh well, bedtime. Come, Simba. UNGHAHHH! Well, Garfield, it looks like we packed on a little weight over the holidays. What do you mean ""wee."" fat-man?
- Only humans gain weight.
- Cats get more ""buddhaesques"". pat pat Garfield, we are going on a diet. Uh...just what do you mean by ""we""?
- By ""we"", do you mean you and this blanket?
- I don't think I'm getting through to him. Odie, Jon has some bad news for you. Garfield, you shouldn't take food for Garfield.
-
- He's right. An artificial color died to provide me with this meal. This salad needs something.
- I think I'll garnish it.
- WITH A HAM! WHAM! As a reward for staying on your diet, I'm going to allow you to have some sugar with your coffee today.
-
- Let me rephrase that Garfield, I know dieting is though fo you.
- But, you've really sunk to the depths this time!
- Hey! I'm sure I'm not the first Dieter to lick the pages of his candy wrapper collection. What...no fries?
-
- Boy, is Jon going to be sorry he put me on his diet.
- Well, I hope you're happy, Jon. Look what this diet has done to me.
- You know, Garfield, I think you've lost too much weight. That's an understatement.
- Here, have an apple.
- BONK BONK
- ARRGH! GOOSH! Maybe watching television will take my mind off this diet.
- And now, back to...Bowling for the Meat Loaf.
- I'll just put some pepper on my carrot here.
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- That tastes like chocolate cake! Let's hear it for food processors. Diets
- Diets are like Jon's socks...
- They stink. Ah, it says here carrots are on my diet.
- And this is a ""carrot"" cake.
- A LOOPHOLE!
-
- Yes, even your toe is overweight. Here you go, Garfield. PLOP
- Leftovers. Leftover from what?
- SPLAT! THE SPANISH INQUISITION? Hum...Garfield, it says here that doctors now say diets don't work. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!
- SMACK SLURP MUNCH
- Hey, Odie, do you know what they put in dog food?
- Dog food has lizards and yak lips and gum that's already been chewed and aluminium siding...
- And some stuff you wouldn't even want to know about.
- Garfield! We're out of cat food. You'll have to eat dog food today. Okay.
- URP
- What's with Odie? Must have been somethin he ate. Garfield, I worry about you.
- I know you hate getting up...
- But, lynching the alarm clock? I had it coming. I tried to impress my date with humor tonight. Uh-oh.
- At dinner I stuck carrot sticks in my ears and smeared mashed potatoes all over my face. Then what happened?
- Then she borrowed a quarter and called the police. Ouch. Mr. Arbuckle, it's about your cat...
- As a government employee I deserve respect.
- And I'm not getting any. What's a matter? Can't take a joke? You call this taking care of the mouse problem? keep a safe distance, Jon.
- You are not normal. This is going to work.
- Feed 'em 20 pounds of cheese and watch'em explode! This is a great book.
- ""Things To Do ON A Rainy Day""
- Do you feel a draft in here?
- Chapter one: ""Fun With The Electric Razor"". This is fun.
- Garfield, how many sardines do you hav ein your mouth? One hundred nineteen.
- WHY?! I'm playing fish hatchery. Well, Christmas and new year's have come and gone. Nothing to do but sleep till easter.
-
-
-
-
-
- Oh, very well, Garfield. You may have my steak.
- I know, I'm a sucker for the loving adoration of a pet. I hate morning, I hate monday, I hate january.
- SLAM
- And I REALLY hate having the windowsill slam down on your fingers. The bedroom is freezing this morning.
- I'd better turn the heat up.
- OR GET THE CAT OFF THE CRATE! Gee, a new coffee with twice the caffeine.
- It even comes with a tiny crowbar.
- To pry your fingers off the cup. WHOAH!
- SPLANG
- Ah yes, the ol' ""seconds away from blissful slumber"" body spasm. Pop!
- Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!
- We'r eout of popcorn. Garfield, would you say I have an interesting personality?
- Yes, I would.
- I'd be lying, but I'd say it. And now! The great Odini shall escape from the watery chamber of death.
- Rats! I woke up. I swear this happens to me every day!
- It's another ""hurts-to-move"" moring.
- I'd say my eyelids weigh about 38 pounds...each.
- GARFIELD! TIME TO GET UP! Garfield's gone! The hogs ate him!
- Rise and shine, fella! Check my neck, bozo. I have no vital signs.
- You spend too much time in bed.
- That's only one man's opinion. What a boring life I have.
- How could anyone have a more boring life? This is it, Garfield!
- Today's the day I tweeze my ear hairs! I guess anything is possible.
- HI, ODIE!
- THUD! That was too easy.
-
- Z Oh.
- BWOING!
- Breakfast in bed, Garfield? Sloth is the monster of invention.
-
- Dogs are the animal by-products in the weenie of life.
- WOOAAH!
- Thanks a lot for wrecking my shot, Mr. Twinkle Toes! The Caped Avenger has discovered the secret of flying: missing the ground.

- Then, I'm going to the gym to pump some iron.
- Yes, and I do believe the gymnasium is this way. Welcome to an evening of macho posturing. Just look at that moon, Garfield.

- Hey! Get lost. Not only are we dull...we're weird, too.
- Tonight's spaghetti night.
- That's when we sit around and pretend we're eating our hair. There's crazy uncle Ed.
- He liked to sniff waffle irons.
- We spent many happy hours playing Tic-Tac-Toe on his face.
- Good, Garfield's not around. I won't have to share my milk.
- My date was going real well tonight.
- My sophistication swept her off her feet.
- Then I noticed I was wearing my underwear on the outside of my pants. Sick. Garfield, you made me breakfast!
- What is it? I'll give you a hint.
- Mmmm... What has six legs and can't swim in orange juice? Finished with thine breakfast, knave?
- Did someone leave the faucet running?
- Soo, Odie! Leave me alone.
-
- GARFIELD!
- But, Jon! I didn't do that! It wasn't me!
- SLAM!
-
- Here is the world's greatest alarm clock.
- It has hands that glow in the dark.
- And a snooze button with a three-day delay.

- Garfield's Cat Primer
- Why cats are lazy...
- Cat's point of view.
- Why cats need help.
- Cat's point of view.
- Why cats hate dogs.
- Cat's point of view. And why cats are vain...
- A cat's point of view. You gotta go on a diet, Garfield.
- Even your face is getting fat.
- Whose face is fat? Ah, that was a nice meal.
- CRUMBS!
- It's diet week. slup slup slup slup I know it's natural to clean up your dish when you're on a diet... slurp slurp slurp
- But, if you're not careful, you'll lick a hole right through that bowl!
- Guess again, sucker. GLUP GLUP
- Oh no! I've been on this diet too long!
- I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO SWALLOW! Diet gotcha down, Garfield? I'm lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut.
- I have about as much chance of surviving this diet as a one-legged opossum on a freeway.
- Why, soon, you'll be skinnier than a string been in a pumpkin patch. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. zzzzzzz
- zzzzzz
- Nice try, flabbo Z
- Wow! jelly beans! I love jelly beans!

-
- SLURP! Try this new cat food, Garfield. No thanks.
- It has beef, liver, chicken... Not interested.
- Leg of a mailman. You wouldn't kid about that, would you? I hate it when mud build up on my feet.
- knock knock knock
- YAAAH! Up and at 'em, Garfield!
- There's a big, wide, wonderful world out there! True...
- But, there's a small, soft, warm bed in here.

- Odie left his brain to science.
-
- And they made an early withdrawal. Z

- This is a story about high hopes dashed in the big city...
- It's not a pretty story, but...I'm not a pretty cat...
- It was a dreary night in the warehouse district. I knew what I had to do... I had to open the door... No matter what...
- And then it happenened...
- GASP!
- I had come this close to my big dramatic debut. I'm exhausted!
- I guess I overdid it.
- That's the last time I take three naps in a row without a break. Hello? Debbie, my sweet?
- YOU FAT GREEDY PIG! I OUGHTA SHAVE YOU AND PUT YOU OUT I THE COLD!
- CLICK Hello? Do you think this tie is too wide, Garfield?
- Absolutely not.
- However, you do need to gain about 300 pounds. I'm looking for just the right cologne.
- That, coupled with my personality, will render women helpless.
- Maybe you should try chloroform. My date and I went hiking.
- We drank fresh water from a stream.
- I got a leech on my forehead. Lots of screaming, I hope. Aren't you ever going to get up today, Garfield?! Jon, Jon, Jon...
- You don't understand. Sleeping is an art...
- So let's not be disturbing the creative process, hmmmm? RING RING RING
- RING RING RING
- Where is that Jon, anyway? RING RING RING

- COWABUNGA!
- Why can't you bat at a piece of string like other cats?! Growing old is sad, Garfield.
- So many dreams never to be fulfilled...
- I may never play the bagpipes! Stop. You're ripping out my heart. Listen to this, Garfield.
- As we grow older, our attention span gets shorter.
- Pretty interesting, huh? What? Next week I'm going to turn eleven.
- I wonder if I'll be older and wiser.
- Probably just older. Hey, Garfield! Where are you? Oh, just lying here in the corner, thinking about my birthday and counting my wrinkles.
- The only thing that can cheer me up is to have a really great birthday party...with all my best friends.
- And YOU'RE not invited! TLING *
- ** TLING TLING TLING TLING TLING TLING * TLING *
- Looking for your bithday gift in the closet? Oh, shut up. Hey, Jon...
- I know I said I wanted a ""big"" birthday party...

- FOOF!
- Do you know what lazy is?
-
- Lazy is taking a coffee break between naps. There are two rules for assembling a model airplane...
- Never get glue on your hands. And, if you do...
- Never pick your nose. I have to go to the hospital now. A spotlight hits center stage.
- Out steps the star! The crowd goes wild!
- Thank you! Thank you! Why am I doing this? MY STEAK!
- GARFIELD; YOU'Re NOTHING BUT A THIEF! I resent that.
- I'm a thief AND a glutton. Well, here it is saturday night, Garfield.
- I think I'll just curl up with a good book.
- And a box of (sob) tissues. I wish he'd get a date. Well, this is another fin mess you've gotten me into.

- You two have a lot in common, don't you? Ouch. Doc, will you go out with me? Sure, let's go now.
- CLICK
- I didn't say I'd come BACK with him. So just where are we going on this date, Jon? Skating, my sweet.
- SKATING?! Yes, but first I thought you might enjoy dining out.
- Gee, I'm glad I wore my pearls. I'll have 3 triple Binky Burgers with extra nose squeakers. Liz is going to be so impressed, Garfield.
- Watch ol' Jon work his skating magic on her!
- My hero. This was a good idea to go skating, wasn't it Liz?
- Been skating long, Jon?
- Why do you ask that? I can't believe it! I'm so embarrassed!
- I can't believe I blew a chance to give Liz a good-night kiss!
- I can't believe I kissed the doorbell! You're supposed to kiss her and close your eyes, not close your eyes and kiss her, you dip! 'Ah got a hole in mah sole, an' ah got dem kitty litter blues' tap tap tap
- SLURP!

-
-
- WHAP!
- Hey, Garfield. Do we have any cheese? Yes, we have that in green or brown.
- I'm thinking about cleaning the refrigerator out! You can't do that! This food has great historical significance!
- This spaghetti sauce was used to cauterize wounds during the civil war. poink
- I wonder if this nail is important.
- You weigh 12 pounds.
- You weigh no pounds.
- What do you weigh these days, Garfield. Oh, I'm averaging about 6 pounds. BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Ahem...bark, bark, bark.
- BARK! YIP! GRRR ROF! BARK! BARK! That was dog for ""your mother has fleas"". Just what is success? To some it's wealth and notoriety...to some it's a simple sense of self-worth, but to me it's contributing something toward the betterment of mankind.
- What's your definition of success, Garfield?
- Being able to eat 20 pizzas without throwing up. Whatever you said, I'm sure we all saw that one coming. Hey, Odie! Nah, nah, nah, nahhh. naaahhh *
- SLURP!

- Fine, I'll be outside...
- Letting the air out of your tires. Doc Boy! How are you? Don't call me Doc Boy!
- Oh, sorry. Hmmm what else did I used to call you?...
- Oh, yeah! Iguana Gums! How are you? Call me Doc Boy. Sure is peaceful here. Yup, always has been. Always will be. Nothing moves fast here. Nope.
- Oh, bys! Dinner!

- Mind if I join you? Not at all, dad.
- You boys gotta lose some weight. Okay, dad. Garfield, this is a pig.
- Pigs are used for food. I know that.
- Your people root for truffles, don't they? Look at those pigs, Garfield.
- All they ever do is eat and sleep.
- GET OUT OF THERE! ""Oink,"" I say. Sit on that egg for ya, lady?
-
- Hey, Odie, guess who's going to the vet today?
- Poor Odie.
- I had an uncle who went to the vet once...
- While he was there, they removed his brain and replaced it with the brin of a chicken.
- He spent the rest of his life breaking into grocery stores so he could sit on the eggs.
- Let's go, Garfield. Me?
- You heard me. Give me a minute to preen my feathers. I did it!
-
- I got an entire loaf of bread in my mouth! Congratulations, Garfield. Z
- Z
- BONK! Z Well, well, well. I see you're going bird-watching.
- You have your field guide, your binoculars and your frying pan. Have fun!
- Frying pan? I'll save you a drumstick.
- Lunch, Garfield!
- Don'T touch him or you'll lose my page. Z

- * How'd you like to be bitten by a doorstop, fella? z

- For those of you wondering, I'm only half asleep. I'll gladly pay you tuesday for a cheeseburger today.

- Hello?
- AYIEEEE! Definitely worth the quarter. Let's see what the forecast is today...
- ""Saccharine with occasional coyness""?
- I wonder what that means? Well, if this isn't Nermal, the world's cutest kitten. In Person.
- Tell me...how is it you've uh, you've... I've stayed the same while you've withered like a two-year-old cantaloupe?
- ARRRGH If you nail'em hard, there's plenty of time for a getaway. Gee, I'd love to be in a cute cat calendar someday.
- That could be arranged. Really?
-
-
- How's it going? Haven't quite got the hang of it. Worried about wrinkles, Garfield?
- Just remember, wrinkles only exist to show where the smiles have been.
- You life must be a laugh riot. Oh, shut up. Z
- STOMP ZINNNG!
- He didn't even say ""goodby"". Garfield, these rice cakes are nutritious and low in calories. Bingo! The two magic words that make me retch! ptoo
- Odieee. Oh, Odie!
- Odie! I'm stuck up this tree! Go get help!
- What a guy.
- What the...?
- A bowling ball? What good is this?
- CRACK! I hate dogs. I'm beginning to think there's a bigger world out there...
- A sixty-fourth of an inch last night, Garfield! Congratulations, Jon.
- Those toenails are really growing now. Garfield, I can't scratch you any longer. My hands are cramping up. Fine.
- POOK!
- I love gourmet cooking, Garfield. If it doesn't move, I'll eat it.
- cReativity is the key. If it moves a little, I'll eat it.
- I just can't get the meat loaf inside the Danish. Heck with it. If I can catch it, I'll eat it. I enjoy sophisticated humor.
- Fetch, Odie!
- BONK! Like watching a dog run into a wall. Garfield? Do you think I'm overweight?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I needed that. Good morning, fellow food freaks.
- Dining etiquette rule number one...
- Never stand in a warm pizza. That's right, kids. It's always nice to share. Soda pop.
- *
- Rats!
- I just can't get comfortable.
- If I can't get comfortable, I'll never get to sleep!
- Wait a minute...maybe if I raised my right arm and leg and laid my head back and got my tail out of the way...
- Z I don't even wanna know.
- What the...?
- Penthouse. It can't be time to clean uot the refrigerator again. The meat loaf has toadstools.
- These leftovers haven't been IN there that long. The baked beans need a trim.
- Thy couldn't POSSIBLY be that old. There' an arrowhead in the guacamole. C'mon, Garfield, let's exercise to music.
- * I got rhythm, I got rhythm. *
- Come on, Garfield. * I got a hernia, I got a hernia. * I droipped your bed and broke it, Garfield. I'll fix it tomorrow.
-
- I'll fix it today. Whenever. Like my tie, Garfield? Well, I...
- You in the house...you are surrounded!
- Oh no! It's the geek police! Throw out the tie! Ha-ha, Odie. I'm inside and you're outside, and you can't come in!
- SLURP!
- I THOUGHT this window seemed awfully clean. To eat or not to eat, what a silly question. Certainly 'tis nobler to clean thine plate to maketh room for more.
-

-
-
-
- It's monday. What an ugly day.
- Hey, Garfield. We're going camping!
- Maybe if I die, I won't have to go. Great day for a camping trip, right, boys?
- Yessiree, families should do stuff together.
- Good idea. Let's all get carsick. Hmm...what's this little handle for?
- SCREEEEEEEEEE THONK
- Leave the parking brake alone, Garfield! Looks like we can't stop for lunch, boys.
- I can't find a restaurant.
- HEY! I'm on the scent! Isn't this fun, boys? You know, I have a feeling nothing's going to spoil this camping trip.
- BUMP!
- Congratulations, you just ran over a cow. Let's get out, get some fresh air and stretch our legs, boys.
-
- Odiue likes it. Leave the keys so I can listen to the radio. I think there's something wrong with this lasagna recipe.
- Watch ad learn.
- Survival is my life, Garfield. Watch me set up camp.
- First we unpack our food, then roll out our sleeping bags...
- Build the campfire... rub rub rub rub
- And finally set up the tent.
- Let's see now...what have I forgotten? To notify your next of kin? Well, here we are camping, boys. Isn't this perfect? I disagree.
- The tent is perfect, the view is perfect. Everything is perfect. It's not perfect yet.
- NOW it's perfect. This rain will end someday, Garfield. WE just gotta have a sense of humor about this. I'll never be dry again.
- HEY!
- THERE'S A CARP IN MY KNAPSACK! Where's your sense of humor, Jon? Uh, Garfield...we have some snacks in the car. What are you trying to tell me, Jon?
- Go get 'em for me, will you? Sure. No problem.
- The firewood's getting wet, Garfield. Go get it. No way.
- I SAID, GO GET IT! Okay! Okay!
- Your firewood, Bwana. Oops. Go outside and see if it's still raining, Garfield. Yes, sahib.
- Good news! It's stopped raining!
- It's snowing. Hey! It's stopped raining!
- Let's go hiking, boys!
- See what happens when you don't have sidewalks, Odie. Here we are, boys. Out here with mother nature, no cars, no clocks, no stress. ...no TV, no microwave, no refrigerator, no indoor litter box.
-
- Grrrrr
- Odie! Did you hear that? That sounded like a bear!
- LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!
- Whew! We made it! We're safe!
- Maybe we should've warned Jon. I can't beluieve it. Two weeks cooped up with Jon and Odie in the middle of nowhere.
- If I don't get to visit with some rel humanity soon, I'm going to go starkers!
- So...rock, read and good books lately? Go outside and check for bears, Garfield. Sure, why not?
- No...there are no bears out here...
- Just pumas. Here, Odie, have a toasted marhmallow.
- SLURP!
- I really do hate camping. Okay, so it rained for two weeks. We still had fun, didn't we?
- GOOSH!
- Okay, so I forgot to roll the window up... Do you know what I'm looking forward to after camping, boys?
- A nice hot shower.
- And from the smell of things, you guys could use one, too. Camping was sure fun, wasn't it, boys?
- Gee, I wish we could camp just one more night. That can be arranged...
- CLICK Enjoy! ...and I have a hundred more pet stories. I guess the party's over.
- Ye-ha! Whoopee!
- * Party! Let's have a party! Yee-ha! I hate fleas.
- Ya-hoo! This spray should do the trick.
- Gas! Hit the deck, boys! PSSST! Ack! Cough, cough. Medic? They got Sam! Speak to us, Sam!
- Wheeze...cough...come closer, boys. I gotta say one thing...cough...
- What is it, Sam?
- * Paaarrty! Let's have a party! ** Yee-ha! This stuff is worthless. Okay, campers, it's time to exercise! Let's start with some leg lifts...ready, begin!
- Annnd ONE and...
- CLICK two. ARRRRGH!
- I'M BEING CHASED BY A SNAKE IN A FUR COAT.
- Something wrong with your tail? Tail? I knew that. I can't see! I can't see!
- Garfield, your blanket is over your eyes.
- I knew that. Sometimes I worry about that boy. Jon put a bell around my neck.
- He thinks it'll keep me from catching birds.
- He's probably right. Art is my life.
- Voila!
- I think I'll call it, ""squirrel-tracks leading from empty lasagns pan"". It's five A.AM., Garfield. A great time to jog.
- YAWN
- Z I knew that nonsense wouldn't last long. I say, ""why diet?"" I say, ""why don't the do something about gravity?""
-
- This is it, Garfield! I've made up my mind! I'm throwing them out!
- Attaboy! Go get !em!
- CLICK Okay, time to go!
- HEY! WHAT'RE YOU DOING?!--
- WHA...WHOA...-WHA?!...HEY! ...WAIT A MINUTE!!
- YAAHH!!! OOF! THUD SOCK POUND POUND
- YEOOOWCH! OW! OW! OW! GAAAAAAAG...YAAAAAHH!! POW! CHOKE BIFF BIFF BIFF
- When leftovers get real old they can turn mean. Sigh...monday.
- It's dreary and pouring rain.
- What could be worse? There's a motorcycle gang in the driveway. Should I be mean or lazy today?...
- Or, maybe a happy medium...
- I'll just lie here and bite anyone who trips over me. This day is the dullest...
- Things can't get more boring than this...
- Any more stamps around here? Bingo. Hey, Garfield! It's hot and humid today! The conditions are perfect! Let's go!
- I'm getting a front row seat.
- Silence please, we're watching the linoleum curl. Wanna spice up those dull meals?
- Just dumb your food on the table...
- and make it dance! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! You need help, Garfield. When people get bored they change things.
- For instance, look at Jon here.
- That'll tech him to take a nap. Kids...please don't try this at home.
- YAWN
- I'm bored. I gotta find a purpose in life.
- FOOF!
-
-
- FOOF
- Can I try that? Find your own feather. I wonder what time it is?
- Hmmmmm
- Feels like breakfast time. CLICK
- WHOCK!
- Stupid garage door opener. Garfield, is this your box? Yeah.
- It's full of mailmen's hats! I'm collecting them.
- Where are the mailmen? THEY'VE ESCAPED! And now a scientific experiment to see if dogs can land on their feet.
- BLOONG
- I hate eating in bed.
- There must be some deep psychological reason for that...
- Or maybe it's because I'm lying on my fork. Sometimes it's good to get up early and do chores.
- AARRRGH!
- Like moving the litter box to the side of Jon's bed. My mind says ""get up and get active,"" then my body begins to laugh.
- Here, boy!
- There's something very special about Odie...
- CRASH!
- That wasn't it.
-
- CRASH!
- Now THAT was special. My, my, what's gotten into you this morning? It's what's NOT gotten into me. I'm on a diet, you freak.
- I thought fat people were supposed to be jolly. They're ecstatic they're not on diets.
- Come on...cheer up. Oh, very well. A carrot stick, all I get on my diet is this stupid carrot stick.
- Jon says diets are supposedto be pleasurable...
- Unless this thing starts tap dancing, I'm gonna be real disappointed. Remember, when preparing chicken...
- ""Waste not, want not""
- These beaks make lovely wind chimes. This show's great for the diet. How does the diet go, Garfield? Uh, okay.
- I'm really proud of you. Yeah, thanks.
- Uh, what are you doing in there? Licking the oven grate. Garfield, you've dome so well on your diet, I've decided to let you cheat a little.
- Here's an extra carrot stick!
- Now why nid you noo nat? I'm hungry. I need an appetite suppressant.
-
- Jon's leftovers always so the trick. It takes years of practice to get this depressed.
-
- Cement
- !
-
-
-
- Garfield, I think we should dispose of all our high-cholesterol foods. Good idea.
- ZIP
- You ate everything in the refrigerator! No need to thank me, Jon. I'm just a civic-minded kind of guy. Jon's starting to worry me.
- He's so desperate for companionship he'll talk to anybody...
- Even answering machines. My, you have a lovely beep. Some tasteless people wear clip-on ties.
-
- Jon wears clip-on SUITS
- Here's your dinner, Garfield. How about service with a smile?
-
- I hope the food is safe to eat. ...where's my toothbrush?
- Thank you.
- BRUSH BRUSH BRUSH BRUSH These are the memories that last a lifetime. I wonder if it's time for my midnight snack?
- Hmmm...eight P.M.
- Close enough. * Oh, mouseeeey! Why don't you come out and see me? * I can see you fine from heeeere *
- Get out here, mouse, or I'm coming in after you! Ha! You couldn't even get your fat head through the hole.
- Oh, yeah? Well we'll just see! About that, gorgonzola lips!
- UHNNGGGHHH! ERRRGGHHHH! HUURRRRRRP!
- AHA! Now where's you go? POP!
- I'm stuck.
- What the....?!
- I think I've been had. Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane!
- No! It's... WHOP!
- SUPER POOKY! Pooky makes me feel safer at night...
- That's because he's so soft...
- He also has a black belt in Karate. ZIP GULP!
- WHANG! WHAP!
- ZIP Pooookeeee!
- Just right!
- sniff sniff sniff sniff
- PLOP
-
- VERY FUNNY, GARFIELD! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME THINK YOUR TEDDY BEAR CAN SKATE!
- Say again? This is all part of the joy of having pets.
-
-
-
- ZWIP!
-
- It's all in the wrist. Z
- Asleep again, Garfield?
- Define ""again"". Garfield, have you seen the mousetrap I baited with gouda cheese? Nope.
-
- OOHK ARRRK EEHHK URRRK Jon and I make a great team.
- He likes to cook, and I like to eat.
- Want some ketchup on that armadillo?
- I'm breaking up the act.
- GOOSH!
- Garfield, I put. The water in my food bowl. I know. Seeing a magnificient universe such as this makes me feel like an insignificant speck.
- How about you, Garfield? You're right.
- I think you're an insignificant speck too. Delbert's doughnut shop...hello?
- YOU WANT DOUGHNUTS? WE GOT CREAM FILLED DOUGHNUTS, CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS, JELLY FILLED DOUGHNUTS, HELLO? ANYBODY THERE? CLICK!
- I like staying in touch with my loved ones. sniff sniff sniff sniff The mighty hunter.

- GREEEEEBELNICK NICK NICK NICK . Hm...it's not working.
- Maybe I ""nicked' when I should have ""greeeebeled"". Brrr, there's a chill in here this morning.
- What an eerie sensation...
- This doesn't feel like mxy home. To be continued... Jon? Odie?
- Anybody home?
- I'm alone. You have no idea how alone you are, Garfield. Steady, Garfield, there must be a good reason why the house is empty.
- Jon must be at the grocery.
- For Sale My home has been abandoned. No one has lived here for years!
- But that means...I haven't lived here for years!
- WHAT'S THAT?!
- Jon! Odie! You're home! Hello, Garfield. Have some food.
-
-
- Locked fast within a time when he no longer exists, Garfield grapples with his greatest fear. ...loneliness. After years of taking life for granted, Garfield is shaken by a horrifying vision of the inevitable process called ""time"". He has only one weapon...
- DEnial... I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE
- Want some breakfast, Garfield?
- Who needs it? I need you!
- An imagination is a powerful tool. It can tint memories of the past, shade perceptions of the present, or paint a future so vivid that it can entice...or terrify, all depending upon how we conduct ourselves today... End SCOOP

- Mornings. Boo
- Huh? Boo
- Oh...right. Not the scariest ghost movie I've ever seen. Guess what, Jon! I can hypnotize myself!
- I am getting sleepy! Verrrry sleepy!
- Z The Amazing Garfield. KICK! Don't worry! I have this flawlessly calculated.
- TWANG! See? A 25-foot leash.
- Oh yeah...and 2-foot arms. Garfield, do you realize I probably saved you from a life of living in the streets? scratch scratch scratch
- And now I spoil you rooten. Bless you, Jon. scratch scratch acratch
- Now let's get that backside, shall we? Thirty days without food or water, lost in the burning desert! I can't last much longer...this is it, men...
- SPLOT! GASP...farewell!
- Garfield, what are you doing? Dinner theater. Next to lasagna, I must have another favorite food.
- GULP!
- It's a never-ending quest. Oh! I see that you've found my rubber mousey.
-
- SWOOSH
- THUD!
- Ouch! whimper whimper
- poke poke
-
- Thanks, buddy. Hey, Garfield! We're going to the farm today! Well, shut my mouth and paint me red!
- Well, shoot the horse and slap me silly!
- Now, cut that out. Well, stomp on frogs and shove a crowbar up my nose! There are so many great things to do on a farm.
- Yup
- Eating and leaving come to mind. Farms are so dull.
- Maybe there's something exciting in here...
- AIIIYYYEEEEEE SPLOOSH! Come on, Garfield. Dad's gonna take us into town to see the new stoplight.
- I've had all the excitement I can stand for the day, thanks.
- After this morning's tour of the new indoor plumbing. MOM! THERE'S A WHITE MOUSE IN MY ROOM.
- DAD! DOC BOY! COME QUICK!
- It's white, all right! Must be one of them albinos! They're very rare! These people need a TV. Thanks, mom. We really ha
- How about taking some food with you?
- Wel...maybe just a... DAD!
- Hey, Doc Boy! I think that side of beef will fit in the trunk! Anything else you'd care to fix, Jon?
-
- zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Hello there, little housefly.
- Wait! You're not a housefly!
- You're a Zordogian Sun Sponge, sent here to rob the planet earth of all its sunbeams!
- But wait! They get their energy from the sun! If I close the drapes, I will deprive it of its life-giving sunlight.
- ZIP! DIE, SUN SUCKER!
- HA HAAA! IT'S ALREADY DISINTEGRATING INTO A HIDEOUS, GREEN, STEAMING GELATINOUS MASS! I hate being left out. Gee, I can't seem to wake up this morn... Z
- Oh. Z
- POP!
- Much Better.
- Tag! You're it! KICK! CRASH!
- Dogs certainly are playful! The weather today will be partly cloudy with a chance of rain.
- If you need me, I'll be out from rotating the tire on my unicycle.
- And the owner today will be partly dippy with a chance of stupid. BURRRRR
- RRRRRRRP! CLICK!
- You're disgusting. 43 seconfd! A new record! Heeeeey, kids! Wanna see Binky do a magic trick?
- Well, forget it! I'm not speding another minute in this supid clown suit!
- A am an actor! But, noooo...too short they said!...
- Third time this week. He's lost it. YAWN
- What a great nap.
- Maybe a tad long, though. Just think, Odie, our lives are in his hands.
- THUNK!
- This chair isn't level. thunk thunk
- That's easy enough to fix.

- FWIP FWIP FWIP
- YEEEK! C'mon down, spider.
- Looky, looky, looky!...
- Do you like chocolate milk shakes? Sigh.
- Sure is a quiet, lazy sunday afternoon, isn't it, Garfield? Sure is.
- Kinda makes me feel like singin' the blues.
- * Ain't got change for a nickel, ain't got laces for my shoes, now my baby's left me... ** ain't got nothin' but the blues. *
- HEY THERE, GOOD-LOOKIN', I GOT THE BLUES. WANNA CHEER ME UP?!
- You?! The blues?! Ha! There you sit in your powder blue Oxford shirt in your own home in a middle-class suburb. You don't know nothin' 'bout the blues!
- WELL; EXCUSE ME FOR SUCCEEDING!!! It WAS a quiet, lazy sunday afternoon. YAWN . Erk!
- This is known as ""cold-floor shock"". Garfield, you have no self-control. Oh, yeah? Watch this!
- Down, boy! Down! Atta boy! WHOP!
- Pathetic. Go to sleep, boy! Good boy! Ah, there's my first cup of coffee for the day.
- And my first doughnut for the day.
- HEY, WHERE'S MY BREAKFAST? And my first joke on Jon for the day. My, you're looking pleasant today!
- I'm making a conscious effort.
- I tied my ears behind my head. I have the last of the ice cream, Garfield. Fine.
- I'm going to eat it, and you not. Enjoy.
- I replaced it with lard. This is a flea collar, Garfield.
- And do you know what we do with flea collars?
- Noooo...guess again. I could have sworn I left my secret formula here somewhere.
-
-
-
- click Heeey, kids! 5-4-3-2-1
- ARRRGH!
- The old ""cat-hair-in-the-toothbrish"" gets him every time. Note anything different about me, Garfield? Hmmmm?
- Could it be the clown faceI put on you while you were asleep?
- I got a new shirt! I guess I'm not very observent. No mail again today?
- Garfield, have you been harassing the mailman again? Hey, relax.
- He'll be back for his pants. You're an animal. Garfield, have you seen my striped tie? I can't find it anywhere!
- Oh well, I guess I'll just have to wear my polka dot tie instead.
- * Now he's a dip coming AND going. With dogs it's easy, but it sure is hard to tell your moods, Garfield. Not really.
- This is happy.
- And this is mad. GARFIELD! WAKE UP! Z
- Oh, no. I slept in the corner again.
- Oh, sure, laugh. And I suppose this has never happened to you? Insomnia claims yet another victim.
-
- BARK! SPLAT!
-
- SLAP! boink boink boink
-
- reek reek reek
- I saw nothing. BIFF! POW! BAP! What do you wanna do today, boys?
-
- Wanna decorate the tree? That would be nice. I'm home with the tree, boys! And I can't put presents under a tree that' not decorated.
- WHOOSH
- You missed. More the right this time, Odie! And hurry! Time's a wastin'! Jon's gonna put my present right there. It's gonna be big and real expensive, and...and...
- Hmm...big.
- It's gonna be big and...
-
- I haven't bought you a Christmas gift yet, Garfield.
- Then how am I supposed to find where you hid it?
- AH-HA! SWIPE
- I still haven't bought your Christmas gift. I knew that. I love the Christmas season.
- Call me sentimental...
- But, the greed just rips at my heartstrings. Okay, okay, no more Christmas carols.
- My public awaits. jingle jingle jingle
- jingle, jingle, jingle
- Season's greetings, holiday revelers. How do you get to the north pole?
- Why just go to the south pole and head anywhere!
- Why do Santa's reindeer fly?... It's faster than walking!
- How many elves does it take to make a bean bag chair?... Six if you stuff 'em in real tight!
- And ho-ho-ho, boy, it's Santa Fat. Okay, Garfield, I have finally bought your Christmas present.
- I have, however, hidden it.
- In a SFAE place.
-
- He'll never find where I hid his Christmas present. I'll bet Jon ahid my Christmas present under the couch.
-
- Nope, not there. Odie, you're a dog, right? I want you to track down my Christmas present. Arf!
- sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff He's hot on the trail now, folks.
- Odie, Odie, Odie.
- You're not even close, Garfield.
- Boy, cah that guy hide a Christmas present or what? I give up!
- I have looked everywhere for my Christmas present...
- That sucker is nowhere to be found! I feel festive!
-
- Garfield, what do you really, REALLY, want for Christmas? What I really, REALLY, want is...
- ...uh, I guess it's hard to gift wrap sleep, isn't it`
- And food, I get food all year 'round.
- Got my teddy bear and my bed and this house...
-
- And my friends.
- What I really want is a second helping of everything. Okay, Garfield, open your gift!
- SURPRISE!
- It's family! Bearing food! You know what I like! I love the holiday season...all the family together, sharing holiday memories. I almost hate to see new year's come.
- BOOGIE! BOOGIE! BOOGIE!
- And then there are those of us who live for the moment! Why aren't you wearing the Christmas present mom made you, Garfield? It looked better on Odie.
-
- GARFIELD! For the new year, I resolve to be more polite to dogs.
- KICK! CRASH!
- Excuse me! I wonder what this next year will hold for me?
- I'll probably slip through the year in a half-conscious, sleep-induced state, overeating and being rude to Odie.
- Just a wild hunch.
- HONK! SPOOT!
- What are you doing?!! Practicing for tomorrow night! You know, Garfield, it's tough being the life of the party. You couldn't be the life of the party at a morgue.
- Stand aside, Garfield. There's a wild and crazy new year's party out there with my name on it! Can I go, too?
- Now while I'm busy being the life of the party, you sit in the corner and do whatever it is cats do. Yes, sir.
- Hey, hey! Here comes ""Mr. Party Animal""!
- Hey, everybody!
- Did anybody here order 2000 pepperoni pizzas?!
- Who am I? And where did I get this rubber chicken?
- Water balloons are four o'clock.
- I love the way this chip dip squishes between my toes! Hey! Turn down those chain saws!
- Are you here for the human sacrifice? We love your cat! Want him? Here it is, new year's day.
- Time to celebrate, Garfield style!
- Z DOOF!
- Garfield, what made you do that?!
- I think it was the earflaps. Welcome to ""Truth is Stranger Than Fiction Theater"".
- The following story you are about to see is absolutely true.
- Except, of course, for the stuff we made up to make it more interesting. I love television. What's new, Garfield?
- Well, King Kong is on the roof batting down airplanes. The entire planet is being ravaged by brain-eating aliens...
- But more important, my dish is empty. Do you want the rest of that cereal?
- Garfield, you've just had a dozen doughnuts, six pancakes, a pound of ham and a quart of milk.
- So, what's your point? Look, Jon! I cleaned my bowl!
- I ate every bit of my dinner! Aren't you proud of me?
- How about the fact thet I ate your dinner, too? Does that impress you? Hey, guys, let's make snow angels. Nah, let's make Odie lick more bumpers.
-
-
-
-
-
- pat pat pat pat pat pat
- Time for bed!
- CRACK!
- It's diet time. Rats. I have a new diet for you, Garfield. sniff sniff Smells great!
- There you go. I can't wait!
- Oh no! You can't eat it. Oh no! Not the AROMA diet?!
-
- How goes the diet? Oh...you know. For your diet, I expect you to drink 12 glasses of water a day. Got it.
- GARFIELD!
- What's that slice of pizza doing in your glass?! Pizza?! I thought that was a water spot! Diets stink.
- Here's your boiled cabbage, Garfield.
- I rest my case. Hey, c'mon, fella. I'm just a bathroom scale.
- I don't do livestock.
- EEERRRRRRGGGGG! What happened?! Odie was just showing me his impression of a chihuahua.

- ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!! I'LL FIX YOUR BREAKFAST!!! I've painted eyeballs on my eyelids...
- ""Why?"" You ask?
- And when I was three, I remember mom coming out to the chicken coop saying, ""Jonny, Jonny, Jonny, where have..."" Boy, what a great nap! scratch scratch
- STRETCH
-
-
- I have hair in my ears! I sensed an impending crisis. Z
- WHIRRRRRRRR
- GARFIELD; HAVE YOU SEEN MY PENCIL SHARPENER? Life sure was great on the farm, Garfield. Here we go.
- Soft summer breezes, golden fields of wheat...
- Then, came the locusts. Good, a happy ending. Jon thinks he can trap me into going to the vet using a grilled cheese sandwich as bait.
- What kind of gluttonous idiot does Jon take me for anyway?
- What, no picle? The brownie troop strikes again.
- Z
-
- pant pant pant pant
- I'm trying to take a nap. Odie. Now scram! pant pant pan

- shake shake shake
- tock tock tock tock tock tock
- Here, Jon! Have a bon.
- Where did you get this? Jon, I have good news and bad news.
- The bad news is, that Odie got his face stuck in the vacuum cleaner.
- The good news is, I think we solved our ant problem.
- HA! BEAT YOU TO IT!
- Uh, Garfield. Would you mind taking your claws out of my hand? Give me a good reason. Your dinner, sire.
- He's finally learning his place!
- I was being sarcastic. Don't ruin the moment for me, Jon.
-
- Is this a new dish, Garfield? Nope, it's your old wading pool. Never ask others to help you diet.
-
- grinka
- ?
- grinka grinka
- grinka grinka grinka grinka grinka
- Stupid recliner.
- WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! Forget it, Garfield. C'mon, Jon!
- Go on a diet! Please?
- I refuse to describe your feet! Just tell me ig they're happy! Packing on a little weight there, aren't you, Garfield?
- Absolutely not!
- And by the way, your TV tray's sitting on my stomach. Ah, here it is.
- They say wearing vertical stripes makes you look thinner.
- Or, in my case, like a water melon. I'm too fat.
- SCRIK!
- Now I'm too tall. What a great idea!
- I've never looked thinner.
- Maybe this recliner will press me out thinner...
- Hey! It works!
- Just call me ""Slim Jim"". Garfield, you wouldn't know what happened to my fern, would you? Who, me?
-
- Sigh.
- Jon's not home...
- Odie's taking a nap... Z
- And Pooky's being cleaned.
-
- Sigh. YAWN
- I wonder what time it is?
- Let's see...the big hand is on the floor, and the little handis unde rthe couch in the living room, so... Here's something you'll enjoy, Garfield. We'll see.
- A beautiful sunset...
- And a cookie. You're right.
- Ever had a night when you just couldn't get comfortable?
- So has Jon. Look, Garfield, a lion! My great uncle was a lion.
- King of the jungle! Yup, he was a big shot.
- The mighty hunter... Then, one day, he ate a sick monkey. Garfield, there was a pan of lasagna here.
- Where's the lasagna? Resting comfortably.
- Where's the pan? Resting not so comfortably. Garfield! What have I told you about climbing curtains?
- I'm not climbing curtains.
- I do, however, have a real bad case of static cling. Vacancy--> Hungry, Garfield?
-
- The mighty lion lies in wait...
- He spies a herd of eggs over easy!
- They become skittish, sensing danger...
- HE STRIKES!
- The village dam bursts, sending orange juice gushing through the melee!
- Can't I have a normal breakfast? Sometimes he hears the rustling of toast in the bush! Okay, heads I watch TV, tails I stay in bed. ting!
-
- HEYYYY! Kids! I'm helping Jon with the housecleaning.
- Here, Jon. I cleaned the candy out of the box.
- Now I'll see if there's anything cluttering up the cookie jar.
- Nobdy can relax like you, Garfield. How do you do it? -Slipping while swinging from the light fixture halps.
-
- I'm being ignored. May I have a lock of your hair?
- SNIP!
- I'll keep it as a memento of how stupid you look right now. A funny thing happened to me on my way to the fence tonight.
-
- Z
- Z
- POINK!
- STRRRETCH
-
- SNERK!
- PLOP!
- Z False start. I only know two things about life...
- I love my teddy bear and my teddy bear loves me.
- Simple truths are the most profound truths.
-
- Here you goo, Pooky.
- Hang on tight, now.
- Sniff, they grow up so fast. Wanna go jogging? I'm busy.
- Honestly, Garfield. I have the feeling you think more of that teddy bear than you do of me!
- Pay no attention to ol' what's-his-name, Pookie.
-
- Gave your bear a bath? How'd you guess? Why is that teddy bear of mine always getting lost? Why can't I ever find him?
- POOOOOOOO-KY!
- And why am I cupping my hands over my mouth? Plastic birdbaths require a less direct approach.
-
-
- PHOOT!
-
-
- PHOOT!
-
- Oh, Garfield! Breakfast!
- CRACK! CRACK!
- You wouldn't perchance, know who nailed my blanket to my bed, would you? snick snick snick snick Odie
- GULP
- Stop, Vermin. Eek.
- You'll never escape. Help, help.
- One of the great chase scenes. Z z What are those, mommy?
- Well, the cute one is a cat, and...uh, the other one appears to be some kind of fat weasel or something.
- Are you going to let her talk about you like that? I adore you! I worship you! I love you more than life itself! I can't live without you!
- Uh...Garfield? Yes?
- Why are you talking to my popsicle? Some flowers for you, my dear.
- Gee, I'll bet they used to be lovely.
- And tasty too. I'll just have a drumstick.
- digga digga digga digga digga

- Uh, Odie. DIGGA DIGGA DIGGA DIGGA DIGGA Garfield, life is like a festival.
- You have to get out there and enjoy it! That's what my uncle Arno said.
- You're not moving. He was run over a parade. What a beautiful day!
- A day that says, ""come outside and enjoy me!""
- I prefer a day that says, ""stay inside, relax, watch some TV, grab a nap."" I'm depressed, Garfield.
- And do you know what I do when I'm depressed?
- I play the BONGOS! Now I'M depressed. I'm bored.
-
- Wanna look at my tongue and guess what I've been eating? Go away.
-
- Thanks.
- FOOF
- And the crowd goes wild. Keep flapping, Odie. We want all the little birdies to feel welcome.
- cheep cheep cheep

- Odie and I are going to play on the roof.
- Roller skates?! Look out below! I'm turning the tables on Garfield. I'm stealing HIS dinner.
- I HAVE GARFIELD'S FOOD! I HAVE GARFIELD'S FOOD!
- What's all the commotion about? Ever notice how other cats scamper around, Garfield?
- YOu never scamper.
- You sort of ooze. I have bad knees. I've lengthened my name...
- And I do believe it will serve me well.
- Garfield Horatiq III, Esq. Embellished our name, did we? Fill 'er up! We're going to the lake, Garfield! I hate the lake.
- Boating! Last time I ate a toad.
- Fishing!
- Came back with the tongue warts Now this is my kind of refrigerator magnet.
- Z
- Hmmm, the stare'im-in-the-face-till-he-wakes-up-routine isn't working. Z
- Z WHAP WHAP WHAP And the slap'im-silly-with-the-tail routine isn't either.
- Z It's time to call in the heavy artillery.
- Oh, Odie!
- You know what to do, boy.
- Yes, it's the cold-nose-in-the-middle-of-the-back routine. Yeeuck! A spider!
- This can of bug spray ought to do the trick.
- KRONG KRONG KRONG Do you realize I'm your best friend, Garfield?
- OH, NO!
- What happened to the pizza delivery boy?! Ha ha! You look like an Eskimo, Garfield.
-
- GET OUT OF THE FREEZER! Garfield, have you seen my shoes? Many times.
- And, by the way...
- Have you seen my new flowerpots? Garfield, you eat enough to eat three cats.
- I know, Jon, and I'm so ashamed.
- Now be a good boy and fetch dessert. I'm glad we had this talk. Fascinating.
- You know, Garfield, people should read more books.
- I thought so. Hold this for a minute.

- And Jon's nowhere around...
- Looks like I'll have to serve myself.
- TUG
- Couldn't wait, could you? tap tap tap Look Garfield. I've had my portrait done!
-
- I'll get the darts. Should I tell Jon there's a spider crawling up his leg?
- Should I tell Jon there's a spider crawling up his shirt?
- YAAAAAAH! I guess that little dilemma took care of itself. Whew! Boy, I ate too much. Know what I mean?
-
- NO, I guess you wouldn't. Aren't you going to lick your plate? What's new, Garfield? I'm teaching Odie to fly.
- THUD!
- Homework. I've carved this lovely statue.
- Using only my claws.
- And the sofa. Here, Garfield!
- Good boy! You came when I called!
- Are you talking to me? Now, there's a face that would make even a mother scream.
- coo-coo coo-coo
- Garfield, I could sit here and pet you all evening.
- But it's almost seven and I have to get ready for my date. You'll have to get down now. I like it here.
- C'mon, Garfield! She'll be here any minute! Get down! But I'm warm and cozy!
- DING * DONG! Oh, great! There she is now! Garfield, get DOWN!
- OW! HEY! NO CLAWS! STOP THAT! DOWN! DOWN! GET OFF! OW! STOPPIT!
- My, don't you look lovely this evening. You know, we're both getting pretty porky lately, Garfield. Oink oink
- I think we should diet together. Diet together by yourself.
- After all, ""misery loves company"". Is your family coming for a visit?
- Garfield, we're on a diet. Leave Odie's food alone!
- growll
- ROAARR
- Dueling diets. I won.
-
- AHA! AHA! Not enough to eat, Garfield?
- Let me take care of that.
- Garfield, this diet is one of the healthiest we've ever been on.
- It only lacks one thing.
- Food. I concur. I'm suddenly feeling very sympathetic to cantaloupes.
- Z
- Garfield, breakfast! Z
-
- SLURP
- SHOOF! Take that stupid blanket off!
-
- SLURP Garfield will get a kick out of this apron! Kiss The Cook
- Oh, Garfield!
- Never mind. Feed The Cat. What? Good morning, Garfield.
- GOOD MORNING!
- You gotta cut down. YES, THANKS! I WILL HAVE AN 11TH CUP OF COFFEE! Poor Jon.
- He was hoping to win a marathon...
- But he passed out lacing his shoes. I sent Garfield out for the day.
- Maybe this will get his mind off food for a change.
- Big cupcake spill on the highway! Figures. You know, Garfield, sometimes I think my life has been a failure.
- ...that I'm a loser and a bore.
- But, then I get out my lint collection and I know it's been worth it. Z Viewers, are you lethargic?
- Let us help you. No thanks.
- I wrote the book of lethargy. SEE The World's Fattest Cat Tickets I'd be very upset about this if I weren't getting 10% of the gate.
-
- Jon says I'm not pulling my weight around here.
-
- So there are a few mice around. Big deal.
-
- And one or two squirrels, so what?
- I think the armadillo herd pushed him over the edge. My old school chum is coming to visit, Garfield.
- * DING DONG ** There he is now!
- Wheezer! Carp face! I'll find a motel. Wheezer this is my cat, Garfield.
- Looks just like you, carp face! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW!

- Yeah, too bad we couldn't find dates.
- That strapless chiffon gown was you. Do you think the tiara was too much? I think I've heard enough. Hey, Garfield, here's your owner's senior picture. Uh...
- Jon Arbuckle ""Carpface""
- This explains a lot. Hey, carp face, remember the reptile? That dance we used to do on the floor? What a hoot! Let's do it!
- * Yeah, let's do the reptile ** The ** Rep-rep-rep-rep-reptile.

- What worries me is that JON isn't worried. I worry when Jon goes out.
-
- I worry he'll come home. Garfield, do not eat my doughnut.
-
- Your lips said ""no"", but your eyes said ""yes"". Huh?! What's that noise?
- CLICK! Sounds like it's comingfrom the kitchen.
- Now when did I get that ugly centerpiece? ice cream Kinda gloomy out there this morning isn't it, Garfield?
- Well, not to worry, I have an antidote!
- Good morning, sunshine! The sad part is, he was up all night making these. Jon loves the works on his hamburger.
- It has lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, mustard, catsup, onions, cheese,

- My dear, sweet mother, ""make 'em laugh, sonny,"" she used to say.
- GET HIS MOTHER! YEAH! Tough crowd. There's something special about getting mail, Garfield.
- It's nice to know someone's thinking of you.
- Dear deadbeat, send a payment or I'll repossess your teeth. From your brother! How sweet! Good evening, Monsieur.
- For your pleasure, I have prepared dinner.
- And, for your convenience, I have eaten it. I'm going to get some honey as soon as I clear these bees out of here.
- Fore which I have a plan.
- Okay, Odie. Make a sound like a daisy. Garfield, that's a silly hat.
- But, then, you ARE eccentric.
- Cunning, too. I hear the mailmen are really biting around these parts.

- Hi, guy! What are you doing up here? Look, Garfield! A kitty treat!
- Oh boy! Oh boy! A kitty treat! Ha-ha! Boy howdy. I'm going crazy here.

- CHONK! Ahh...I guess the beach isn't so bad.
- SLOOSH!
- It's worse. Oh, Garfield.
- Garfield, I'm going to teach you self-control.
- This is a box of kitty treats...
- Do not take the kitty treats.
- I'm leaving the room now. You are not to take the kitty treats.
- Okay! I'm coming back to it now! The kitty treats had better be there!
- You didn't eat your vegetables. What are you going to do? Tell my mother!
- I think I will.
- Look! I'm eating 'em! I'm eating 'em! Tell her he ate his dessert first! Cookie time!
- Jon's so easy to fool.
- Liver Ordinarily.
- Was that an eclipse?
- Oh, it was just Garfield walking past the window. Shaddup. It's impossible not to enjoy the playful nature of a cat.
- Hey, Garfield. Let's have some fun!
- Do you have an appointment? I CONFESS!
- I'VE BEEN PLOTTING TO STEAL YOUR CANDY BAR!

- Hey, look, Garfield! A seed in a a seedless grape! Don't ask. WHAT A DISASTER! CHOCOLATE SYRUP AND NO ICE CREAM!
-
- Okay, so it's not a disaster. What do you think of my new curtains, Garfield? They're pre-shredded so there's nothing you can do to them!
-
- Ha! Ruined them! Guess what, Garfield?
- Your life is hopelessly pointless?
- I think my bunny slippers are in love! I stand corrected. Did you know you can harm planty by talking to them?
- Observe. Then I got into stamp collecting. I liked to stick them to my forehead...
- I had red ones, and green ones, and blue ones, and pink ones... Not a pretty sight. DING DONG *
- The mailman's here. Good, I haven't had a bite in weeks.
- Garfield, meet my new assistant, Waldo.

- Yup. I was discovered and brought to civlization. And when was that?
- Last friday. That explains a lot. What a weird date. I took out this lady who was raised by wolves.

- Garfield! Ther eisn't a speck of food left in the house!
- That's what I just said. Yessireebob
- What an exciting friday night... SNAP!
- Fun with tape. Brrr...it's cold this morning.
-
- KONK! Turn up the heat! Ohhhh, Garfield. Sigh
- Let's look at the old family album, Garfield.
- Here's a picture of my uncle Waldo.
- He lived on a ranch.
- Had one of the latest warthog herds in the country.
- Of course, that was before he was arrested.
- He was accused of selling ugly bacon. I ignore him, but he never goes away. Starting today, I no longer recognize mondays!
- ZWOOP SPLAT!
- Unfortunately, they still recognize ME. Z
- Z Dinnertime.
-
- The mailman already came today, Garfield.
- He did? You know, Garfield...
- Sometimes I get the feeling you don't respect me. Really?
- What brought this on? Darn! T stubbed my toe.
- Hey, it's no big deal.
- Thanks for caring, Garfield. It's not like it happened to me.
- trop SPLAT!
- Dogs are nature's way of telling us we could be worse off.
-
-
-
-
-
- ALL RIGHT!!! ALL RIGHT!!! I'LL FIX BREAKFAST!!!! Do you think I'm boring, Garfield?
- Z
- Oh, great. Now I'll never know. ROWWWRF! GROWFF! SNARL SNARL WOOF!
- BARK! BARK! ROWRFF! SNORT SNORT WOOF!
- ROOF! ROOF! ROWF! Have you had your blood pressure checked lately? There's nothing to do.
- BOOT!
- Okay, NOW there's nothing to do. That mouse has stolen a cookie!
- Go get it, Garfield!
- Got it! Garfield, do you think this needs salt?
- GULP! Just a little. Catsup on your eggs, sir?
- YEEUK! GARFIELD!
- Gee, I must be the only one who likes them this way. Z GNAR-FIELD!!!
- Z
- Oh, Gaaarrrfield... Oh, nooooo...
- Guess what Iiiii've got?... An annoying personality?
- TAH-DAH! A BALL OF YARN!! Good for you.
- Aw, c'mon, Garfield! All cats like to play with yarn! poke poke Not when they're sleepy they don't.
- C'MON! C'MON AND PLAY WITH THE YARN! If you insist shake shake shake
- He's right. That was fun. Garfield, what are you doing? Pretending I'm on the ""Animal Kingdom"" show.
- You just lie araound! I've been hit with a tranquilizer dart.
- You're lazy! Soon I'll be tagged, so they can study my migration patterns. My pet spider, Renaldo here, can do a trick!
- WHAP!
- Of course, he can only do it once! Garfield, come here! He think I'll come running whenever he calls.
- Garfield! What am I, a dog?
- I have donuts! Arf, I say.
- TOUCH MY FOOD AND DIE!!
- Oh, come on, Jon. You're not THAT bad of a cook. What is life all about? Eating and sleeping.
-
- I'm hungry. Z Garfield! I'm home from the store!
- Cany search!
- It's in the sack! Who turned the lights out? Oops!! Sorry, wrong strip!
-
- That's driving me crazy!
- ODIE, STOPPIT!!! grab
-
-
- AAARRRGGGGHHHH! whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr I think I came in late again. Jon, if you can guess how many cookies are in this jar, you get the entire contents!
- You ate them all, did you?
- WE HAVE A WINNER!
- WAH-HA! HA! HA!
- Boy, haircuts are deceiving. Ball of yarn.
- Here, Jon.
- You know, I have a sweater this exact same color. Not anymore. Perhaps I shouldn't steal Jon's food.
-
- Then again, he doesn't seem interested in getting it back... If I want something exciting to happen, I can't just sit here.
- I have to MAKE it happen!
- I'm wearing knee pads on my elbows! You're a wild man, Jon Arbuckle! Hey, Garfield. How's the weather down there?
- HA! HA! HA! HA!
- Drafty.
-
- I'll fix this.
-
-
-
- Shnall I call a TV repairman? Thank you. click
- This looks like an intelligent and informative program.
- CLICK Fortunately, there are other things on. Quick! Turn to channel five! It's tie for ""Gone Fishin' with Billy Bob Beauchamp""!
- What's the deal, Garfield? Here, read this!
- ""This week Billy Bob removes a hook from his neck"". They've been hyping it for weeks! ...and so we end another programming day. Until tomorrow, good night.
- Z
- TURN THE SET OFF!!! Arf! What is it, boy?
- Arf! Arf! He says he's hungry.
- You say Timmy fell down the old mine shaft? Arf! He wants pizza. Let's see...nine o'clock, channel six...
- Movie: ""The Mummy's Curse"".
- ""Mummy rises only to be hit with five thousand years of back taxes"". This show is really dull.

- There's nothing like a warm teddy bear on a stormy night.
- Just ask anyone. Sigh.
- Teddy bears aren't very good huggers...
- But they're sure great HUGGEES!
-
- What mice? Garfield, has it ever occured to you that I may have better things to do than scratch you?
- YOU? HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- Just thought I'd ask. More to the left, please. GARFIELD! Hark! The Caped Avenger's super hearing detects a voice in distress!

- BARK! SPLOT!
- Stop that, both of you!
-
- BARK! SPLOT! Sniff-what's that smell?
- AH! FRESH AIR!
- It'll never catch on. A few sit-ups a day, and I'll have a flat stomach.
- You should be doing the same, Garfield.
- I'm satisfied with a flat back. Jon has taken up weight-lifting.
- He's been at it quite while now.
- I didn't know you could lift weights with your throat.
- What is this, a laziness contest?
- I win. SLAP! Z

- You gonna date for a while, or marry and start a family right away? ""Time flies when you'r ehaving fun"".
-
- Are you saying this day will never end? Here's another one...
- RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP
- Now that we're done reading our newspaper, maybe we can scratch our tummy.
-
- Garfield... What broken lamp? Thie wimpy little dog could use a twangling. Z
- TWAANNNNG!
- Talk about your unpleasant surprises.
-
- * *
- Birds in the mouse hole? **
- Something weird is going on here.
-
- This time-share thing is really getting out of hand. Cats are the world's greatest tree climbers.
-
- Altough I personally never work without a net. Z
- Z Only Grafield. Z Ethel, look at that.
- Wow!
- That's gotta be the fattest orange I ever saw! Hey, Arbuckle, your cat's in the tree...
- And you'd better pick him? He looks a little to ripe!
- HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! Step under me and say that, fella! Odie! You got a ladder! You finally did something right!
- Now get it up here!
- I suppose I should just let go and drop to the yard below.
- YEEOWCH!
- What a STUPID place to put a statue of liberty lawn ornament.
- Sigh...
- There's ""Dry-Skin-Itchy""...
- There's ""Wake-Up-First-Thing-In-The-Morning-Itchy""...
- And there's ""Fleas-Itchy"".

-
- Sigh...I abdicate. Tell me, Jon.
- How's life treating you?
-
- Garfield... What sparrow?
- GOOSH!
- From now on, let's be putting water in the water dish, and food in the food dish, okay? This bulletin has just been handed to me!
- Police report that someone is going around handing bulletins to newscasters!
- ...and here's another bulletin! I like to check on Garfield and Odie to make sure they're playing nicely.
- I'm measuring Odie to make sure I use just the right amount of concrete.
- How nice.
-
-
-
-
-
- Some people have exciting lives.
- Some seek adventure and romance.
- And some stay home and tease their eyebrows.
- Garfield, I need a hobby. They should give out awards for dull days.
- Hey, Garfield, I'll bet if I connect all the splattered bugs on my car windshield I can make a picture!
- We'd have a trophy case the size of Canada. Sigh.
- I found a snake in the backyard. I'm bored.
- Every day, the same old stuff. I put it in your underwear drawer. Our lives are dull with one exception.
- Pass the coconut monkey head, please.
- Our snack life is pretty exhilarating. I feel like I could conquer the world today!
-
- I couldn't get the front door open. My hero. Say! Aren't you... I'm a bird.
- Right! I'm a big fan of yours! I'm flattered.
- How about autographing my tongue? I'm suspicious.
- **DING-DONG * That must be the mailman. I'll get it.
-
- Jon's sure been gone a long time.
- WAIT A MINUE! THIS IS SUNDAY! THE MAIL ISN'T DELIVERED ON SUNDAY!
- You two-timer! That was the pizza boy! I was saving half of it for you, honest, Garfield!
- STOMP STOMP STOMP Weird. Guess it's true what they say about a cat scorned.
- No fair!
- You got a head start on the goofing off! SMACK!
- Fill it up.
- Having a bad day, Jon? Meow* *Cats of the world unite!
- Meow meow* *Scratch the furniture!
- What are you watching, Garfield? CLICK! Nothing! See that, Garfield?
- Do something about it!
- Hey, I'm a CAT, not a carpenter! Blindfolded taste test!
- GULP!
- I hate you. Thank you for your opinion, sir! Let me hold the door for you, Jon!
- Farewell, and return safely, dear friend!
- Grocery shopping. YAAAHHH!!

- GARFIELD!!!
- Stop scaring the goldfish! RATS!
- A WRINKLE!
- And that's not easy when you have fur all over the body. Oh, no! A wrinkle!
- OH, NO! A GRAY HAIR!
- OH, NO! A WRINKLED GRAY HAIR!! AAAAAHHHHHH!!
- YAAAHHHHHHH!
- AARRRRRGGGHH! Found his fiorst gray hair. Rats! Another grey hair!
- Maybe hair dye will help.
- aaah. Wow! What happened to you?! I found a ghray hair and used hair dye, okay?
- That looks weird. I know.
- You look like Mickey Mouse! I KNOW! They say rubbing lemons on you is good for your skin.
- rub rub rub rub
- I fail to see the improvement. pat pat pat
-
- Now for a nice nap in the sun.
-
- Age must be catching up with me.
- Where has all my vitality gone?
- Wait a minute! I'm not getting old.
- I never WAS vital. You get slower as you get older, Garfield.
-
- That's your opinion.
-
- Make my birthday cake this big. Hapy birthday, Garfield! What would you like to do today? Oh, considering my age, not much.
- GULP!
- Perhaps a nibble and a nap. click clickety clickety click Why is that you always have to be the center of attention, Garfield?
- What?
- That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. All I want is to be treated fairly!
- Is that too much to ask?!
- So now, how come you have two cookies and I have only one?! Dinner, Garfield!
- ZOOM! GULP!
- Ha! You missed your dish! Then why am I full? Z

- Now the Amazing Lardo will make this bowl of food disappear!
- DRumroll, please! Are you picking on me? Garfield, you must weigh as much as Australia!
-
- One of the smaller continents. Garfield! Look at that stomach!
- You must take your health more seriously.
- It's hard to be serious while staring up your nose. From now on, I'm keeping track of the calories you take in!
- POW!
- My calculator blew up.
- I hate it when I can't see my feet.
- I could be wearing weird shoes and not know it. Blindfolded, I shall now identify things I cannot see.
-
- FOOD!
- I hate you. Who's that?!
- Okay, I'll take your order now.
- Oh, and here's your balloon. My balloon?
- We're trying to create more of a happy family atmosphere.
- We even have pony rides out back. That sounds like fun!
- Now, what'll you have? I'll have a hamburger.
- Well, there goes the pony ride. I'll be waiting in the car. Ready or not, here I caome!
- I see you, Garfield!
- I gotta go on diet. Garfield, I bought you a diet book. I know.
- I've already lost two pounds!
- To be more specific, I lost the book. Today is the first day of your diet, Garfield. Promise me you won't cheat.
- C'mon, promise me! Oh, very well.
- I promise. Job's got me on a grapefruit diet. How silly...
- KAWHANG!
- ...yet effective. Here you are, Garfield. As per your diet, a small salad.
- Hey! Where's the French bread?!
- Needed a crouton. Gee, Garfield. I feel terrible eating in front of you, what with you on your diet.
- Here you go, Felly.
- Sigh
- Jon's had me on this diet, like, forever.
- Hey! What the...?!
- YAAAAHHHH!!!
- YAAAH!!! YAAAHH!! What is it, Garfield? Something wrong with your feet?
- Feet?...Feet?...Those are feet?!
- Hey, and I bet those wiggly things on the end are toes, right?
- YEEEK!!!
- I HATE cold feet! I'm depressed, Garfield. Just look at this gut.
-
- Thanks. Anytime, Skinny. Cats like to survey their territory.
-
- My territory has dandruff. Sleeping makes me hungry.
- And eating makes me sleepy.
- Life is good. Coming up next, ""The Cat Nature's Smart Aleck"".
- What's on?
- Nothing that would interest you, bean brain. I should stop picking on Jon.
- I sure do enjoy breathing!
- How nice. He has a hobby. RRRIIIINNNNGGGGG
- Sigh
- Do you know why I love you, Garfield? You're so unpredictable.
- RIP!
- SPLAT!
- ZIP
- BOOT! WHAM!
- Me and my biig mouth. Garfield, I really don't enjoy looking at your grumpy face every morning.
- You should start each day with a smile. That's a pretty tall order.
- Couldn't I start with a smirk, and work my way up?
- FISSSS zit zit zit zit FISSSS zit zit zit zit
- Stupid automatic sprinklers. It's noon, Garfield. You've got that big hand, little hand stuff down cold, don't you?
- Do you realize you slept the entire morning? I did?
- Thank goodness it wasn't wasted. ?
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for the pancake to come off the ceiling. Should I kick Odie off the table, or shouldn't I? What do you think, foot?
- BOOT!
- I'll take that as a ""yes"".

- Uh-oh...here it comes!

- Oh, no! I'm trapped! There's no escape!
- AAARRRGGHHH!
- Garfield, what happened?! Morning found me again.
-
- Get off my lap, Garfield. I never get to drive. Garfield! See that seat belt?
- We're not going anywhere until you use it! Yessir.
- Let's hit the road. There, Garfield, Don't you feel safer now?
- I guess the seat belt is okay.
- But this shoulder harness... Hey, kids, don't forget to buckle your seat belt when you get into a car.
- And once you've mastered that...
- Don't forget to unbuckle it. I need more legroom.
- CLICK-CHUNK
- Put the seat back up, Garfield. Hmmmm...
- My seat belts need tightening.
- Oops. This is yours. HICCUP!
-
- DINNER!
- bonk! bonk! bonk!
- toink! toink!
- DONK!
- wooga wooga wooga wooga wooga
- Some assembly required. A letter from mom, Garfield!
- Nothing like news from home to lift our spirits!
- Dear Jon, the chicken died. Probably from boredom. Boy, am I bored.
- Hey, Garfield, let's go the the store and try on socks!
- Every time I think I've hit bottom, somebody throws me a shovel. Odie is a mixed breed.
- His mother was a beagle.
- And his father was a brick. Want to hear about my nap?
- Z
- Z It may be boring, but it's all the world to him. What would you say is my best character trait, Garfield?
- Your ability to order pizza.
- And I'm not just saying that. pat pat We're out of cat food. You'll have to eat dog food, okay?
-
- I suppose you know I'm outraged. Poor little fella.
-
-
-
-
-
- Are you boys quite done? In the interest of national security, I'm afraid I'm going to have to confiscate that hamburger.
- Yes, there is a top secret formulain here which I am going to have to memorize and eat.
- You live in your own little world, don't you, Garfield? There's nothing little about it. Here we are overlooking the Grand Canyon.
- nudge
- We lose more tourists that way. Garfield, I'm home!
- SLAM!
- Was that the refrigerator door? Sure, greet me with accusations. Garfield, how do you explain this?
- When I was young I swallowed a basketball.
- You're a pig! It's been digesting for years. Jon bought me a new diet food.
- Looks like serious stuff.
- It's called ""Hey, Fatso. Eat this!"" While people sleep, cats are busy.
- Prowling, singing, hunting...
- ARRRRGH! ...painting the kitchen. SIGH
- It's no use.
- I can't sleep.
-

- Z I spent our vacation money, Garfield. It had better been on something edible.
- SOOOOooooooo
- LET'S POLKA!! Now I know what ""justifiable homicide"" means. And now, a traditional folk song.
- * Oh when I'm gone...bury me deep... **
- ** 'cause there's wolverines reported in the area... * The accordeon dies tonight. See, Garfield, I roll all my socks into little balls!
- Now they can be filed according to the color, length, material and pattern.
- You just don't care, do you? Beware Of Fence
-
- You're one of a kind, Garfield.
- Why, thank you.
- At least that's what the entire human race is hoping. I hate you. Hmmmmm...I wonder what's in this bowl?
- BOO! YAAHHH!
- The tuna surprise.
- Okay, what would you turkeys like tonight? Shall I sing?

- *
- It's so high it can shatter paper. Hey, what an audience! You've been good listeners, good sports...
- SPLUT!
- And good aims... What a night! Was I ever on a roll!
- I must have had seventeen curtain calls!
- According to the shoe count. Si-gh.
- We had a cat back on the farm. Here we go.
- He was a good old cat.
- And a great hunter.
- Whenever he caught a mouse, he'd bring it to the house.
- Sort of an offering from pet to master.
- I miss those days. Garfield.
- GARFIELD!
- I'm not in right now. If you'd care to leave a message, wait for the beep... Welcome to ""Cats Watching Television"".

- Boys! Boys! That chair is big enough for both of you! Now share!
- He's right, Odie. Let's stop bickering. We can each use half of the cushion, okay?
- I'll take the top half. You never do anything, Garfield.
-
- But, I never get a day off either.
- Tweet?
- It was worth a shot. Garfield, you should cut down on between-meal snacks.
- That won't be easy to do.
- Primarily because I don't know what ""between meals"" means. There ought to be a prize for eating every scrap of food in the house.
- Oh well.
- I guess a job well done is its own reward. I'm going to take a little nap.
- No, make that a long nap.
- Heck with it, wake me at the turn of the century. Garfield, how could you?! My sincerest apologies.
- I'm very disappointed in you. I'm so ashamed.
- Have you no respect for decor?! You eat one doily and you're marked for life. Wait! Wait! I'm not ready yet!

- I'm guessing you don't think we need wallpaper. Picture it! Cupcakes as far as the eye can see! My, my. There's something you don't see much these days...
- A mannerly young man and a well-behaved cat.
- I've had a bad day. Mee to.
- It's been one disaster after another. For mee to.

- Nobody listens to me. Yup, it's right here in the trash compactor.
- Nobody respects me. Right next to your dignity and intelligence. Jon! Jon! The TV just said that giant mutant spiders are crushing the city!!
- And that five thousand foot tidal wave is headed directly our way!! And...and...

- What a great day to romp in the grass! Z
- And for climbing trees! *
- Z Race you home!
- How exhilarating! We should do this every day. Z
- It's off to the shower! I just dreamt I was Fay Wray! Hey, Garfield, I know what we can do!
- Let's sit in this chair and vegetate! Okay, but only for a little while.
- I'm scheduled for a nap in the sunbeam this afternoon. New mailman, Garfield.
- You might have trouble with this one.
- You mean the guy with ""I hate cats"" branded on his forehead? YEOOOOOOW!!! CRASH! UGH BAM!! CRUNCH OOF THUMP THUD!

- Ah
- Ah...AH...
- AH

-
- CHOO! Garfield, I need some female companionship
- Okay, Jon.
- You realize I'd only do this for you. Would you go out with me, doc? Mr. Arbuckle, I'm single, not desperate.
- Well, I'M more complex than that...
- I'm single AND desperate. You talk to him. I'm a cat, not a psychatrist. You know, doc, you could do a lot worse than go out with me. You're right there, Jon.
- I could grow facial hair, or misplace my elbows...
- Or, get a rat in my boot. ...FOR EXAMPLE! Doc, will you go out with me?
- Open wide and say ""ahh"". Ahh.
- No. You know, doc, there's a lot of things about me you don't know.
- I know you have four pens and three paper clips in your shirt pocket. How do you know that?
- I can see right through you, Arbuckle. So, doc, how about dinner with me? NO. Lunch? No. Brunch? No.
- How about sharing a sack of honey.roasted nuts from the machine in the hall?!
- Look, Arbuckle, what do I have to do to convince you that I don't want to go out with you? Anything short of a death threat is wasting your breath. I * My Food
- * I hate this part.
- So, doc, how's Garfield? Fine.
- And how's Odie? Fine.
- And how are you? Fine.
- Okay if i pay by check? Fine.
- How about a date? Fine.
- YEEESS!! YEEESS!! THAT'S CHEATING! If you can't attract 'em, trick 'em. bzzzzzzzzz

-
- YAAAHH! MY TIE'S ON FIRE!!
- Would you like another drink, my dear? No, Jon, if I'm in the mood for another Shirley Temple, I'll suck it out of your tie. I don't believe I just flushed one of my contact lenses down the toilet! Somehow I do.
- And th eonly glasses I brought are my sunglasses. That's okay, Jon. They'll make you look continental.
- Kinda like a french dweeb. I am afraid I must ask you to leave, sir. What?! Did I offend someone or something?
- No, sir. Then what did I do?
- Sinc you've been here, you've slipped beneath the dress code. May I stay?

- WHOP
- Oh, yeah. Sigh
- Life has passed ma by.
- Of course, I had to hide a few times. I won't be home for lunch.
- I'll be working as a towel boy at the birdbath.
- It's times like this I'm glad he can't talk. I think all the creatures of the earth should try to get along, don't you, Garfield? Absolutely.
-
- COUGH I wish I had a little piece of land...
- Abot a mile long, and an inch wide.
- Yessir, my very own spaghetti farm.

- Thought I heard a doughnut.
- RING***
- * RRING! *
- Meow?
- Meow meow meow
- Here, it's for you.
- Meow?
- Which way did the mouse go? He went that way!
- Just curious. Guests are a pain.
- First they defile my water dish...
- Then they want a tow.
- Never fear, Jon, no mouse will ever get your cheese while I'm around!
- No siree. Sigh
-
- You would be more convincing if you were moving. He's onto us. Watch out for the mouse. Riiiight.
-
- You know, Jon, Brazil must be lovely this time of year.
-
- I see the ""strange mice"" are back.
- You lunch looks better than mine.
-
-
- I want to sit there!
- Your end of the couch looks more comfortable than mine.
- Oh, sure, hog the floor! Boy, do I need a shave.
- BZZZZZZZ Wait a minute!
- Whaaa?I forgot I was a cat, okay?
- Enjoying the fire, Garfield? Yup.
- Kind of makes me wish we had a fireplace there.
-
- ? Z
- I thought you were cutting down on your naps! I am!
- I'm taking two four-hour naps instead of four two-hour naps. Ah, the industrious ant...always working.
- SPLAT!
- Take a break. Today on ""Animal Kingdom,"" we go in search of...
- The house cat.
- Heeere kitty, kitty, kitty... There's nothing worse than a low-budget animal show. Ahem... Z
- This is a dog. Z
- And this is a dog whistle. Z
- Observe. Z
- fffff
- It emits a sound discernible only to lower life forms.
- Now this...is a dog trumpet. poing! Garfield, why aren't women attracted to me?
- HEY! THAT'S MY BINKY THE CLOWN CUP! SNATCH!
- MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! I think I've isolated your problem. I remember my first kiss.
- Edna Radsnick...we were on her front porch. The moon was full...the moment had arrived...we embraced...
- Our braced locked...she screamed... That's more like it. Cindy, this is Jon, your blind date for tonight. Anything special you'd like to know about me?
- Uh, six feet, brown...one hundred seventy.five pounds. Red...decaffeinated...chocolate chip...unleaded...
- My dental records? Whatever happened to ""What's your sign""? *
- I have a date.
- With the bearded lady, or the alligator girl? I read the most fascinating article the other day... Good, Jon! Appeal to her intellect!
- Did you know there are microscopic crawly things living in your eyebrows?
- I have to go home now. Take me with you. Your hair is like a field of golden wheat in the sun...your eyes are like limpid pools of blue...
- Your nose is like an ice pick stuck in a barn door.
- Rats.
- Should've skipped the nose and moved right to the lips. tap tap tap

- Meet the next best thing! And now the continuing saga of Jon's diary.
- Monday: ""Dear Diary, The dawn of a new week. The possibilities are limitless.""
- Tuesday: ""Dear Diary, Today I got my lips stuck in the blender."" Why was I created, Garfield?
- What is my purpose in life?
- SPLOT! To give other shope? Welcome to ""Lying around with Garfield"".
- Today's topic, the joy of ceiling watching.
- You are worthless. Now, let's stare at a light fixture. Garfield, we're going to the park. Whoopee
- You know the rules. No flower stomping...
- And... Yeah, yeah, no swan maiming. I'm depressed, Garfield. I need something to lift my spirits.
- BOOT!
- GARFIELD! HEY! IT ALWAYS WORKS FOR ME!! Ahem.
- I am honored to address this assembly of the United Nations.
- And the millions watching by television.
- I am Jon arbuckle, and I can't get a date to save my life. I also forgot to wear pants.
- YAAAHHH!
- Garfield, I just had a terrible nightmare! Not the one about the rubber pizzas?!
- You're a wild man, Garfield!
- New blanket. Everybody has a hobby.
- Some race cars, some collect art...
- And others, make toast. BWONNG! YEE-HA! You know, Garfield, the brain is a muscle. Give me a break.
- Know how I keep my mind sharp? A wood rasp?
- Connect the dots! You're a real intellectual. Sometimes I feel like a laughingstock, Garfield.
- Look! There he is! HAW! HAW! HAW!
- I'll be in my room. Big crowd today. Notice anything new, Garfield? Give me a hint.
- Don't you think this pipe makes me look more sophisticated?
- Sadly enough, I have to agree. Jon is deep in thought.
- I wonder how they get those peanuts inside the shells?
- Relatively speaking. YAWN

- Garfield, Santa brings toys to the little boys and girls who've been good all YEAR, not just the last two weeks.
- THAT'S EXTORTION! I tell it like it is, baby cakes. Hey, Garfield! Now THERE'S a Christmas tree!
- Just look at the trunk of this baby!
- That's a telephone pole. Tis the season to be dippy. I did it! I fainally got a great looking tree!
- And I got it half off!
- What do you think? I think it's priced right. Okay, let's decorate the tree, Garfiedl.
- THEY'RE ALIVE! THE DECORATIONS ARE ALIVE!
- SLURO! Ha ha, Odie.
- Okay, boys! Let's corate the treeeee! I'm hungry. Let's eeeeat.
- Each icicle must be carefully placed. I subscribe to the school of ""throw and go"".
- Odie, don't chew on that cord! Yeah, Odie, save room for the bubble lights.
- We can't have a blue bulb next to a blue bulb, can we? Anything that doesn't get the tree on fire works for me, pal.
- One thing I'll never understand, Garfield, in spite of all the chaos, the ugly tree and the the old decorations...
- Everythig turns out perfectly. One of the mysteries of the universe. This is a mistletoe, Garfield. Watch, and I'll show you how it works. * DING DONG
- SMOOCH
- You make a lovely couple. Garfield will never find his present in this closet.
- Thank you.
- Waaaait a minute... CLICK! There's a present under the tree. I wonder who it's for?
- Garfield
- OHHHHH YEEEESSS! Could my present be a pony? Or, could it be my own TV? Or a new bed? Or a blanket?
-
- Or a cheese grater? Or silk pajamas?... thump thump thump thump thump thump
- thump thump thump thump thump
- Garfield! What are you doing to your gift? Just seeing if it's ripe. I wonder what my present is? I'll bet it's wonderful!
- rattle rattle rattle
- YES! THA tIS DEFINITELY A WONDERFUL SOUND!!
- Time to decorate the house, Garfield!
- Put the ladder there, pal.
- Yessiree, we'll just get the old lights out, and...
-
-
- How cute. Garfield fell asleep hugging his present. I'll put him to bed. Z
- Z
- Z Are you boys going to bed, oar are you going to wait up half the night on Santa?
-
- Could it be that I've built my expectations too high for what's actually in my gift?
- Should I never open it in order to preserve the hope and magic that is the true gift of the Christmas season?
- NAAAAH! How do you like your Christmas gift, Garfield? It's perfect!
- It's beautiful!
- It's me! I called to thank you for the Christmas gift, mom.
- You really outdid yourself this time.
- I didn't know you could crochet a suit. Someone should stop her. Guess what, mom...
- I think Garfield actually likes the sweater you made him.
- The shoulder pads won me over.
- Sigh
- Christmas is over, and new year's is almost here.
- Sigh.
- So it seems appropriate at this time to stop and reflect...
- To reflect on those three words which represent the true meaning and spirit of the holiday season...
- BOOGIE! BOOGIE! BOOGIE! My foot's asleep.
-
- And I'm jealous!
- ABANDON SHIP!!!
- THUD! Oops. Tide's out. That's enough tummy scratching for one day.
- You mean I should turn over so you can scratch my back?
- GET UP! You mean I should stand, so you can scratch my tummy AND my back? My legs!
- I can't feel my legs!!
- MEDIC!!! Very funny, Jon. The mailman is here!
-
- The mailman and his big dog are here!
-
- Beware Of Dog

-
- Hey! The first snowflake of the season!
-
- ...followed by the first freak blizzard of the season. Garfield, take a look outside and see what the weather is like, . Did it snow last night?
- Yes, it did. Ah, winter...the snowflakes gently falling...
- The hills blanketed in white...
- The cat's face frozen in the birdbath. Just get the ice pick. DOOF!
- DOOF DOOF doof doof doof DOOF DOOF DOOF DOOF DOOF DOOF DOOF DOOF
- Might we have a word with ""The Mad Doofer""? Garfield, hurry up! I'm getting tired! gripe gripe gripe

- Big deal. I've done that.
- Not all at once, but over my lifetime that sounds about right. The fair thing would be to split this cookie in half. What do you thik, Garfield?
- I can't make decisions on an empty stomach.
- That's better. Let's seeee... You're right. We should split it. Garfield, don't you think the mice in this house are getting out of hand?
-
- Define ""out of hand"".
- Finally, a nice, peaceful meal.
- CRUNCH! Have you seen my lucky rock?
-
- Yes, yes, the excitement level of this room rose dramatically upon my arrival.
- RIP ACK!
- GARFIELD! Call me ""Spot""!
-
-
-
-
-
-
- HELP! CHAIR! HELP! CHAIR! Never seen a chair go bad like that before. Back in '39 I had a hassock with an attitude. Know why I'm wearing a suit, Garfield?
- All of your other clothes are dirty?
- I'm going out! To buy another suit? I have a date with the most beautiful woman on the planet tonight!
-
- And which planet would that be? I heard that! Jon has a big date tonight.
- He's choosing his wardrobe very carefully.
- Garfield, should I wear the squirting of the exploding tie? We wouldn't want to make the wrong impression. Last night's date was like a fairy tale, Garfield.
- At midnight she ran out of the restaurant.
- She left one of her steel-toed work boots behind. Let's go to the foundry and find who it fits. I give up, Garfield. Depression.
- Women are all alike. Anger.
- To them I'm just another cute guy ion a great suit. Hallucinations. Did you know that pets are good for exercise?

- Or we can stay up and watch ""Revenge of the Killer Worms"".
- ""Bait store owner learns not to tease the inventory"". I'll make the popcorn. Hmmph, another movie about the heroic feats of a kind-hearted, lovable dog.
- Why is it you never see anything like that about kind-hearted, lovable cats?
- Move or die, bean brain. Only an idiot would watch a show this bad.

- I think you know what I mean. Yes, I do.
- Hey, mouse! Your mother dresses you funny! Here, Garfield, lure the mouse with this cheese.
-
- It doesn't seem to be working. What's this in my water bowl?
- It appears to be an inner tube.
- Is the pool closed? I'll never drink water again. A mouse, Garfield! Get it!!
-
- The mighty hunter. I think I strained my shoulder. Do we have any Liniment? It's been nice chatting with you, but now it's time for my lunch.

- Which is why god made the water balloons. Z SWAT!
- I've invented the dogswatter!
- With the help of my local assistant here.

- BOOT!
- It's also quite elusive. Garfield, don't you think you're a little too self-centered?
- Me? Self-centered?
- Get real.
- CRASH!
- Aim a little off today, Garfield? This takes like linoleum! Eating right is easy.
- Each day I eat from the four basic food groups.
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. I am starving.
- I wish I had a pizza.
- WHUMP!
- My wish has been granted!
- Gee, what should I wish for next?
- Some after dinner music would be nice.
- We're a bit slow today, hon.
- Our cook went home sick. Flu?
- Anthrax. This is where I run screaming into the street. Irma, do you give free refills on coffee?
- Interesting question.
- No one's ever asked for a second cup. Antidote, please. What's good today, Irma?
-
- What's edible today, Irma? Try the meat loaf. Uh, Irma, I don't mean to complain...
- But, there's a hoof in my meat loaf.

- Hey, wait a minute! Garfield, there's a cat hair in my food!
- I know how you feel.
- There's food in my cat hair. I seem to be shedding a lot.
- I wonder if Jon has noticed.
- Probably. Cats are so vain.
- Garfield's been preening all day.
- How you doing? These curlers are killing me! Deep down inside, the domestic cat remains a primal beast.

- DINGLE DINGLE DINGLE Hey, Odie. I have an idea.
- Let's put on a disguise and sneak up on Jon's lunch.
- Nice try, guys. Oh, well, at least we can eat the costume. Watch this one, Odie!
- TOING THOCK SPLOT Let's go see what we hit.
- Here, Odie! Take it! Take it! Take it! Having a dog can provide a sense of security.
- I sleep better at night having Odie around.
- Yeah. He bores me too. Meow meow. Bark bark bark .
- HEE HEE HEE HEE
- SPEAK ENGLISH! GIANT RAT!
-
- Did I mention I shaved Odie? Watch this, Garfield.
- Shake, Odie!
- Isn't that great?! Big deal. Get me a pen and I'll give you an autograph.
-

-
-
- Good morning, Jon.
- YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!!
- Having a little paranoia for breakfast, Jon? Somebody ate the piece of cake I was saving.
-
- Any suspects, Sherlock?
- The soup is too cold.
- But I wouldn't cry about it. Here's a story about some lost explorers. They got so hungry, they resorted to cannibalism.
-
- Stay away from me. Just keep the bowl full. woob woob woob woob woob
- SCHLOPP!
- woob woob woob I ATE TOO MUCH! I'M GOING TO EXPLODE!!
- Burp.
- Thank goodness no one was harmed. You can all go back to your homes now. There's nothing more to see. Sniff. Gesundheit.

- ONE MORE TIME!!
- Z Hello there, Mr. Lazy.
- Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.
- Hog dandruff! My lawyers, however, feel otherwise. z
- You need to add more excitement to your life, Garfield. Z! Garfield, when it comes to doing nothing, nobody can outdo you.
-
- I hope you're not waiting for a response. How'd you like to be a bear, Garfield? Every winter you could sleep four months straight.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE CUTTING BACK, WOULDN'T IT?! Z You may think of food as just something to eat.
- But it's more than that.
- It's nap fuel. I'm a simple cat...
- I really don't want much for my birthday..
- Just a simple cake.
- A two layer cake with strawberry icing...
- And a cherry on top. PING!
- That's all...
- Just a siomple cake. So, Garfield, you're going to be fourteen this week, huh? Thank you for reminding me.
- Four-teen...wow-tee. Fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fouuuuuuur-teeeeeen.
- A teense sensitive, are we? Mom made you a tie for your birthday, Garfield. A TIE?!
- Oh well, I guess it's the thought that counts.
- And these cuff links. I must remember to send her a thank-you bomb. Happy birthday, Garfield!
- By the way, may I borrow your golf clubs? Sure.
- RIGHT AFTER I'M FINISHED WITH THEM! A birthday card! How nice!
- Happy birthday, you big nut. Open this card and get a...
- SPLUT! Happy birthday, Garfield! Ready for your cake? Just a minute!
- Okay!
- Bring that sucker on! It took all week.
- But I finally got a birthday gift I like.
- Racing stripes on my bed! Z

- You're not laughing. I went for a physical today, Garfield.
- Guess what they found?
- LAST NIGHT SOMEONE PAINTED MY TOENAILS! Let me see the face you made. Boredom inspector!
- Hmmmm.
- Keep up the good work. pat pat
- SNIFF
- You're weird! Checking his breath for candy.
- There.
- I can always sense when Jon is going away for the weekend. Watch how Jon's face lights up when I enter the room.
-
- Okay, maybe ""lights up"" was a poor choice of words.
- CLICK!
- fluff fluff fluff
- YAWN
- FLOP!
- GOOD MORING, GARFIELD!!! TIME TO GET UP!
- I'd like sleep even better if I were awake to enjoy it. Have you ever noticed how quietly cats can move about?
- CLOMP! CLOMP! CLOMP! CLOMP!
- I certainly never have. Garfield, fetch m yslippers. Sorry, cats don't fetch slippers.
- I will however, fetch the fetcher. Ah!
- It must be fulfilling to have a warm, loving cat on your lap.
- I've lost the feeling in my legs. You're welcome. Did you know cats can talk? We just don't choose to.
- Garfield, I'm home! Who cares?!
- If we did, NOBODY would like us. It says in this cat book that cats are sleek, svelte animals.
-
- What happened to you? I can't read! Okay?! Garfield, how come you rarely meow? That's silly talk.
- Other cats meow. They have no dignity.
- C'mon, meow for me. First you goo-goo for me.

-
- C'mon, jump! I just did. Yes, I glued Jon's finger up his nose. Z
- Yes, it's disgusting. Yes, I'll regret it. Z
- YAAAH! But, for now, let's enjoy the moment. I remember the day I picked you up, Garfield.
- It was a tough decision. Really?
- It was between you and the iguana. I could have lived the res of my life without knowing that, Jon. click
- How do you like this suit, Garfield?
- click I interrupt your meaningless life for this important announcement.
- My dinnertime is in 20 minutes. Don't be late.
- I now return you to your regularly scheduled doldrums. OK, Odie, let's check the list to make sure we've got everything.
- Turkey baster, bubble gum, feather duster. arf arf arf
- ...raw liver, rubber bands, duct tape. arf...arf...arf
- ...moth balls, a nine iron, and the live trout. arf arf arf
- Great! That's all of it! Let's go! Z
- I'd explain this, but it gets kind of technical.
- Z
- YAAAHH!! OKAY! OKAY! I'M UP!!! Remember, you stupid talking scale, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
-
- I can't win. I wonder how I'd look without this stomach.
-
- Give me some good news for a change.
- Congratulations!
- You just gave birth to another chin! Garfield, your stomach is disgusting!
- You can't even see your feet! Oh, yes I can.
- There they are!
- You've gained weight, but, hey, who hasn't?
- These new talking scales with the sympathy chips are great! The batteries are low. Looks like we'll have to weigh you another day.
- Whew! A reprieve!
- Whew! A reprieve!
- DINNER!
- FLOMP!
- Hup!
- EEERRRRGH
-
- It's diet time. Are you speaking to me? Z
-
- I know! I know! Diet time You know, Garfield, dieting is psychological.
- I have something to help you.
- Why is it I have a sudden craving for corn? You may have a salad.
-
- Pork chops aren't considered a salad! I have much to learn. COOKIE CRUMB!
- BANZAI!
- COME TO PAPA!
- Diet getting to you, Garfield? I'm proud to report I've gained only one pound!
-
- With Garfield, the goal of a diet isn't losing weight, it's slowing down the gain. Here's a diet quiz, Garfield.
- Would you turn in your best friend for a jelly doughnut?
- I'd visit you on weekends. I think I know the answer to that one. beep beep boop gurgle urgle urgle
- Okay, Garfield, I figured it out, you may go off your diet. REALLY?
- YAAAH-HOO...
- YES!! YES!! YES!! YES!!
- WHOOPEE!! WHOOPEE!!!
- ALL RIGHT!!! ALL RIGHT!!!
- It would be a good idea to exercise though. What?! Are you crazy?
- GET UP! GET UP! GET UP!
- You have a problem, Garfield.
- Well, wake up, sleepyhead! Ah, nature!
-
- Needs vacuuming. You should exercise more.
-
- More than that?
- We're out of cookies!
- And I think that last one was a coaster. Giant scorpions!
- The wolfman is headed this way!
- King Kong has a head cold and wants to borrow your handkerchief! I'm not moving till I finish this sandwich.
-
- I hate birds. RAH
-
- Hi, Garfield. Yo.
- Whew. Oh, no!
- He's been waiting for this moment.
- Look at him...like a snake ready to strike.
- What's he waiting for? Why doesn't he just say it and get it over with?!!
- Hot enough to fry a cat on a sidewalk. AARRRGH! So, doctor, are dogs more intelligent than cats?
- Well, dogs scored very high in testing. ...and cats?
- Well, they wouldn't take the test. We have nothing to prove.
-
- WHAP! Pretty good hang time on that kick. Garfield, that woman is winking at me!
- It's love at first sight!
- Dust in her contact lens. I ate your dessert. This should keep those mice out.
- They'll never steal my lunch now.
- Unless they charter a plane. I'm going to open my fortune cookie now, Garfield. Go for it, big guy.
- Ah, what good news awaits? crik BURP
- ""A runaway hubcap from a speeding car will lodge itself up your nose"". Promise you'll wake me. Well, Garfield, for dinner you ate all the food in the house.
- That's poor planning! No, it's not.
- What are you going to do in the morning, huh? I plan to sleep through breakfast.
-
-
- CRASH!

-
- Is this a hint? You're getting dangerously close to lunch time. You are watching the National Dog Channel.
- And now the headlines...
- Cats spread disease! I hate biased reporting. Watch it, cat! I have Fido with me today!
- Well, bring on this Fido * Heere, Fido!

- Go back to your homes! Mr. Excitement has spoken! Today on ""Wildlife,"" my assistant, Bubba, will ford this river.
- AIEEE!!
- My, aren't those piranha busy little fellas! I never liked Bubba. Billy writes to ask Professor Astronomy, ""how many stars are there in the universe?""
- Excellent question, Billy!
- Let's see...one...two...three...four... I hope this isn't one of those two-parters. Remember Cindy? The girl who said she couldn't go out with me tonight? I just saw her at the store.

- Heey! She didn't have brain surgery after all! A dim bulb brightens.

- This tastes funny. If you add water, it makes its own gravy. I'm so dull, I'm almost invisible.

- Who said that?
- Garfield!
- Garfield!
- GARFIELD!!
- GARFIELD!!
-
- supper time.
- ZIP Jon! My favorite person!...
- In this room...
- ...at the moment. He's crazy about me. There's no place like home.
-
- We can only hope. My wallet!
- What would a cat want with a wallet?
- Genuie cowhide. Oh, Garfield.
- What happened to my chair?
- Well, first of all, I don't think ""chair"" is the correct descriptive term anymore.
- YOU'RE STANDING ON MY FOOT!!
- My, we're rather self-absorbed today, aren't we? I'm watching television with a cat.
- It's saturday night. I'm watching television with a cat!
- And reality rears its ugly head. I'M WATCHING TELEVISION WITH A CAT!! Z

- BRIIINNG!! Garfield, my high school is having a class reunion! Want to come along?
-
- There'll be a buffet. Oh. Okay. All the guys on the team had nicknames.
- ""Flash""...""Bruiser""...""Rock""...
- Here's me. ""Zit""? This is Harold Melsnick.
- He used to call me a loser!
- This is me at the prom.
- Lovely dress your mother is wearing. Did you bring your wife to the reunion, Arbuckle? Nope.
- Girlfriend? Actually, I brough my cat.
- HEY, ARBUCKLE BROUGHT A CAT! I sense hostility. Wait till you meet Drizella Skagway. She was alittle skinny but she had a crush on me in high school!
- Hey, Wheezer, have you seen Drizella? Yeah. She's over there.
- Where?! Right there. You hung your coat on her. Gary Barker! How about this reunion? Ha ha ha!
- HAW! HAW! HAW! HA! I could always crack Gary up.
- HAW! HAW! Gary...uh Gary? We need a net over here. ""Garfield"" Mmmmh
- There's only one reason I came to this high school reunion, Garfield.
- ...Jennifer Hamilton!
- I worshipped her she thought I was a nerd. Go figure.
- Wait 'till she sees how suave I've become.
- There she is! I've dreamed of this moment for years!
- Hi, Jon. Remember me? stomp stomp stomp GAH GAH GAH Some things never change. Yes, Jennifer, since high school I've become somewhat of a sophisticate.
- I've matured in
- HEY, CRAPFACE!
- REMEMBER THETIME YOU BLEW YOUR NOSE IN THE SCHOOL FLAG? Later, wheezer. Hey, Crapface, sure is a great class reunion, huh? Sure is, Wheezer.
- Remember the time I threw your pants into the girl's locker room? Yeah, you were young and crazy then.
- NOW YOU'RE JUST CRAZY! I love nostalgia. ELMO! AFTER ALL THESE YEARS! GOOD TO SEE YOU! My name's not Elmo.
- Oh, of course...GEORGE! Nope. ED! Nope. FRANK! Nope, it's Jon.
- RIIGHT! JON! WHY, YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT! Who the heck are you? Mrs. Fronzak, my old English teacher!
- What are you doing at the class reunion? Waiting for that overdue term paper, Jonny.
- My, uh, cat ate it! Leave me out of this! Mrs, Fronzak, I didn't know teachers were invited to the class reunion. I'm here on official business.
- I'm the chaperone. The what?
- HEY! HEY! CUT THAT OUT, YOU TWO! Mrs Fronzak, they're married. Watch this, Garfield! I'll show my old classmates I still have all the moves!
- BOOGIE! BOOGIE! BOOGIE!

- Ha! The batteries in the remote control must be dead!
- Is it possible you just might have to walk across the entire room to change the channel?! Heave forbid!
- So what are yougoing to do now, huh?!
- I had to ask.
- Have you ever wondered why pets will suddenly run from one room to another?
- That ought to keep him wondering. Now all my kite needs is a tail.
-
- Is it raining? Nope. It's drooling. Garfield! My shaving cream!
- We're playing ""Rabid Coyotes"".
- What am I to do?! Find us some sheep!!
-
- CRASH! I tampered with his brakes. I've been a good influence on the boys.
- Thy've become very cultivated.
- However, I'm getting sick of ""Swan Lake"". Okay, Odie, let's try out this new flea spray.
- It says here to shake well before using.
- SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE munch munch munch
- Sit, Odie!
- Shake, boy!
- Sit up!
- Lie down!
- Roll over!
- Good boy! EEEEEEEK!!!
- That sounded like the mailman.
- You're weird. That's no way to talk to a person in uniform. From now on, call me ""Mister Fun""!
-
- ""Mister Fun"" is sorting his socks. I don't feel like cooking tonight, Garfield.
- We'll have spaghetti and meatballs from the can.
- In some cultures they eat cats. Not from the can, I'll bet. I think that cloud looks just like a cloud.
-
- Which one? I'm leaving.
-
- But I'll be back. Rats. I'm sleepy.
- And hungry.

- I hate you. Sir, I'm picking up some hostile readings. Garfield, do you know there's a mouse in the garbage? I think so...
- ** Oh, there's a mouse in the garbage, and I don't caaare... *

- Am I boring you, or are you boring me?
-
- That's the biggest slingshot I've ever seen. Cheer up, Garfield! Let a smile be your umbrella!
- That's what my aunt Edna used to say.
- Till a bolt of lightning blew her dentures clean through the garage door. A beautiful evening, Garfield.
- Full moon...warm breeze...
- The neighbors taking sledgehammers to the lawn ornaments. Get away from there!

- That eerie, low lament of some lifeless demon bent on entering our house and dragging us into the dark night.
- ARROOOOOOOO
- Now what's THAT sound? Oh, shut up. Think about it, Garfield...
- Where would you be without me?
- More toward the middle of the chair.

- You're collecting dust.
- And does anybody say ""thank you""?!
- Get up, Mister Lazy.

- I need a new look.
- That's not what I meant. Garfield, I'm changing my image! You have one?
- I'm going macho! Please, I just ate.
- Maybe I'll get a tattoo. How about ""born to whine""? You know, Garfield, a macho man has a trophy wall of wild game. That's not an animal.
- I bagged this Aussie Jackrabbit at 200 yards in the outback. That's your old bunny slipper.
- At no small risk to life and limb. ""In loving memory of Lefty"". Notice anything different about me, Garfield?
- You put your nose drops in your eyes again? I'm squinting! All macho guys squint!
- THUD! Dumb place for a coatrack. My hero. Maybe if I use a blow-dryer and styling mousse, I can make my hair more mach!
- VOOOOO
- Well? It's a start. I know! I'll turnup my collar!! snap!
- All macho guys turn up their collars!
- now I can't breathe. That's a small price to pay for machohood. psssst
- Let's see now...got my macho leather jacket, got my hair combed...macho style...
- Got my macho shades, got my macho gold chains...
- Got my macho cowboy boots, and got my macho wheels!
- Okay, Garfield, let's go! You pull, and I'll pose!
- Ladieeees. They always come out on warm days. Y'know, Garfield, the more zippers a man has, the more macho he is!
- Take a gander at this outfit. It has six gajillion zippers!
- pat pat pat pat Now where did I put my keys? This could take months!
-
- Nope, I still feel depressed. Can we take the hats off now?
- YEEOW!
- Hot zipper. I look back on my life with regrets.
- All those wasted years.
- All that time spent awake. fluff fluff fluff

- I TOUCHED SEAWEED!!
- And sand dweebs. YAAAAAAHHH!!!
- SPLOOOOOSH!
- So, how was bodysurfing? Do you think I'm getting a sunburn, Garfield? Only one way to tell.
- SLAP!
- YEEEEOOOOW! You're getting a sunburn.
- Burying people in the sand is fun, huh? Yup.
- What shall we do next? Wait for the high tide. Sigh
- I don't like this beach, Garfield. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I hate my swimsuit. But, the knees were worn out of your old one.
- The lifeguard kicked sand in my face. I'll have a word with her.
- Those people told me to put my shirt on. Well, they were eating.
- The I went swimming and got seaweed up my nose. It was pretty funny when the kids ran away screaming.
- Let's go home. As soon as Odie finishes rolling on the dead fish.
-
- I TOLD you not to eat your ice cream all in one bite. Do you thin it's easy being a cat?
- WELL, DO YOU?
- Yeah, you're right. BEWARE OF DOG
- BEWARE OF DOG
- And now for a twenty hour nap.
-
- Remember, I'm a professional. Don't try this at home. When Garfield is awake, he's a fat disgusting pig.
- But when he's asleep, he looks just like an angel.
- A fat, disgusting angel. Z

- I'm getting organized. To Eat Eaten GASP!
- HO!! NO!!

- WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?!! C'mon Garfield, let's play! Play?
- Play, as in to exert energy for no apparent reason?
- Is that a ""no""? Sweat is sweat. Poor Jon...
- Outside...with no umbrella...
- BAM! BAM! BAM! And the doors and windows all locked. Odie looks good in a hat.
-
- Lookin' good there, fella.
- You're big, you're beautiful, and people love you.
- I'm a popicle with hair. You are lazy, Garfield, and you can't deny it!
- I can so deny it!
- I just don't feel like it, that's all.
-
- I have a hair dryer, and I'm dangerous! Z
- Z Ahem
- YAHHH! Good morning, Jon! Guess what? It's the Christmas season!
- And I'm gonna be nice to you...
- So that Santa will bring yours truly lots of stuff!
- Here's breakfast in...oops!
- Uh, let's keep this our little secret, okay?
-
- Christmas is coming. We're looking for a Christmas tree. How about an artificial one?
- What's the difference? You don't have to water an artificial tree.
- So? We don't water the real ones anyway. Let's see now...where should we put the tree?
- How about over there, where we put last year's tree?
- Sounds good. * Ah, the traditional ""bringing the Christmas decorations down from the attic"".
- *
- Along with the also-traditional ""finding of the big, hairy spider in the box"". Join us now, won't you?
- In our traditional holiday search...
- For the one bad bulb in a string of five zillion that makes the others go out. Christmas is a time of traditions.
- Some old, some new, some universal...
- And some from the lunatic fringe. C'mon, Garfield! Put yours on! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
- RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
- RRGGGGGGGGGGGGG
- GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Look, Garfield!
- A Christmas card from mom and dad! I could have guessed that.
- You don't see many cards with Santa in bib overalls. What could be more traditional than the hanging of a Christmas wreath on the door?
-
- Santa shouldn't have any trouble at our house tomorrow night!
- I'll turn on the Christmas lights so he can see our roof...I'll leave out milk and cookies in case he's hungry...and...oh, yeah.
- I'll grease the chimney. No way I'm gonna miss seeing Santa this year!
- If I have to, I'll stay...awake...all...
- Z SSSMM
- MAACK!!
- Gotcha! Merry Christmas! Jim Davis. So, Garfield...
- How do you like the turtleneck sweater mom made you for Christmas?
- Too much neck, not enough turtle. *

-
- Let it go, Garfield. I was thinking about mortality. Oh, great.
- What would I ever do if Garfield passed on? Gee...
- Then I started thinking...lawn ornaments. I'll outlive him if it kills me. Tonight I'll be miming the news!
-
- What the?... Either aliens have landed or the aarvark's pants are too short. Jon got another fern.
- You have to admire his perserverance.
- And pity his stupidity.
-
- What are you waiting for? Midnight. This year I resolve to sleep no more than eight hours a day!
- So let's see...eight hours a day times 365, divided by 24...is...121 and 2/3 days!
- Going to bed? Yup. Wake me on may third. It's a beautiful morning!
-
- Wake me in the ugly afternoon. Have A Nice Day Shut Up And Pour
-
- Yes, stamp collecting can be very rewarding...
- EEEEEEEEEEEK!!!
- HELP! HELP! MY DATE IS TALKING ABOUT STAMPS!
- There, there dear...you can sit at our table. Oh, thank you!
-
- I collect bottle caps. OH SHUT UP! I'm tired of scratching you, Garfield. scratch scratch scratch
- Fascinating.
- scratch scratch scratch
- bonka bonka bonka bonka bonka bonka THUD!
- Odie can make good time down the stairs now that they're buttered. Yesterday I filled the cookie jar. Now there's only one left.
- So what's your excude, Garfield?
- No excude. I just missed it, that's all. Oops! I dropped my sandwich on the floor.
- Well, ALMOST on the floor.
- Nice diving catch, Garfield. Thanks! This is The National Cat Network
- Now back to our feature presentation...
- ""Lassie Crosses the Freeway"". I'm rooting for the trucks. An unguarded hamburger!
-
- Cat food! Gotcha. Oh, Gaaaarfieeeeld!
-
-
- scoop scoop
- pack pack
- Okay! Your
- turn. Garfield, what do you think of our refrigerator? It keeps the food off the floor.
- Do you think we should get a new one? Do you think air will catch on as a breathing medium?
- What say we go shopping? Jo, you don't ""shop"" for a refrigerator, you make a commitment. I'm looking for a new refrigerator. I see. Anything specific?
-
- Do you have any with alarms and a time lock? I love refrigerator shopping!
- I wonder what this lever does?
- How convenient. I don't know, Jon.
- As refrigerators go, I guess it's okay.
- But, don't they have anything bigger? For the dieter, here's a fridge with a full-length mirroe. Absurd.
- For the indecisive diner, this one features a peephole. Silly.
- And for the cat owner...a pet door. Practical. Now this fridge has a 19"" TV installed right in the door.
- And for the hopelessly decadent...
- A roll away bed! What? No hot tub? Attention! Attention!
- This meeting of the Loyal Order of Dog Haters is now in session!
- First, a special thanks to Lily for bringing the rats and milk tonight. CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP
- Now let's recite our oath. ""Do unto dogs...then run!""
- Old business: Let's hear it for Roscoe, who sat on a chihuahua last week! clap clap clap clap
- New business: Dog joke...how many dogs does it take to replace a light bulb? One...if you screw him in real tight! ...meeting adjourned! HAW HA HA HAR HAW HA HA
- Who says cats aren't civic-minded? Monday check.
- SPLUT! HA!
- FOOLEd YOU! I am the master of the house due to my superior intelligence!
-
- Your pants are on backwards. I'll get it!
- Hello? ...sorry, he's eating. He can't be disturbed.
- That was rude? Tell me about it. They always call at mealtime.
- SWISH!
- hop hop hop hop Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Jon had a new shirt.
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- He's always like that till he finds all the pins.
- WELL, I THINK I'LL EAT A BIRD!
- I gotta stop talking to myself.
- Hey, Garfield. Yo.
- Do you know that easy chair we have? You mean that big purple scratching post in front of the T.V.?
- Well, mom thought it looked a little threadbare... It's just starting to get some personality.
- So, she made a slipcover for it. Uh-oh.
- The daisy queen strikes again. We could move. This house is full of memories, Garfield.
- Yup, if only these walls could talk. Yup.
- They'd say, ""get a life"". Ever wake up feeling depressed, Garfield?
- Maybe it's my uneventful life.
- Or maybe it's because you glued my hand to my face!! Sure, blame me. Garfield, have you noticed how dull and repentitive our lives are?
-
- Garfield, have you noticed how dull and repentitive our lives are? Sigh.
- Let's do something. I thought we were.
- Something where we move. You lost me. My life stinks.
-
- Your life isn't so hot either. Better than yours! I feel blue, Garfield.
- You doo look depressed.
- I know! I'll treat myself to a new pair of sweat socks! Oh no! He's contagious! Z
- Go get the ball, boy!
-
-
- ?
- PTOOEY! OH, NO!
- Forest fires! Pestilence! DRought!
- Earthquakes!--
- This won't delay lunch, will it? You get the house filthy, and I clea it!
- You get the house filthy, and I clean it!
- Ah, the delicate balance of nature. Join us again next time for ""Macrame and You""! Z
- Z
- GARFIELD! Z Good boy. pat pat
- Hey, who's the master around here?
- If you have to ask, it isn't you.
-
- Show-off.
-
- Am I in your chair, Garfield?
- You wouldn't believe my day, Garfield.
- First, I tripped and fell down six flights of stairs.
- When I landed, I got my head stuck in a bucket of pork chops.
- Then, a roaming pack of hungry wolves mistook me for lunch...
- ...and chased me into an open elevator shaft, which wouldn't have been so bad had it not been for the rabid shaft badgers.
- And then I... Hey, Mr. Motor Mouth, don't you want to know how MY day went? Why do cats climb trees?
- For a number of reasons.
- Tweet tweet There's one now. Chirp. Ready or not, here I come!
- POW! BIFF! BOP!
- He was ready. Chirp.
-
- Much better. LET GO, GARFIELD! I HAVE A NET!
- BOING!

- Arleeeene, babeeee! Hi, Garfield.
- Uh, don't you have someplace to go? And miss seeing how long you can hold that pose? Are we ever going to have a relationship, Garfield? Nah, we're different, you and I.
- You're neat, I'm a slob. You're refined, I'm just a regular guy. You're generous, kind and giving...
- And, you don't want to share your dinner dish... Bingo, baby-cakes. Arlene, do you mind if I do something impetuous? Go ahead.
- Bark! Bark! Bark!
- Your key or mine, Arlene?
- Mine. Of course, my dear.
- ROWWRRRR Who's that? That's Odie, Arlene.

- AYIEEEE!
- I see you've met my Mongolian screaming carp. You're going to have to sleep sometime. Nice space helmet, Garfield. Thank you.
-
- Where's my goldfish? Exploring (burp) new frontiers. Two astronauts hovering above a hostile planet.
- BOOT!
- One opts to stay aboard while the other beams down to the surface. On your mark, get set, go!
-
- And don't come back. Jon gave me this turtle to keep me amused.
- I'm taking it for a walk.
- Woah! Slow down, boy! Tag! You're it! WHOP!
-
- SLAM!
-
- CREEEK
- Are you going to lie around all day? Of course not!
-
- I was planning to sit up for a few minutes this afternoon. You're a worthless lump of blubber, Garfield.
- That wasn't very nice.
- Lumps of blubber have feelings too. Life is ugly.
-
- Though not as ugly as the underside of a dog's tongue. Garfield, you're lazy!
- I am NOT, Jon!
- Thanks. You ought to tone up those muscles, Garfield! huff huff huff
- Yeah, right. huff huff huff
- How fit do you have to be to goof off?

- That should keep him busy for the rest of the week. Z Wake up, Garfield.
- The early bird gets the worm!
- ...the late cat would prefer coffee, pancakes and a side of bacon.
-
- Z
- He thinks it's night. This is my uncle, ""Tough Bob"".
- He once had surgery with no anesthetic! That IS tough!

- Look out!
- SLURRP! Don't look at my food like that!
- How about like this?
- Or myabe this? Now I've lost my appetite. Garfield, stealing my lunch wasn't nice.
- Not nice?
- NOT NICE? OH, NO!!! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!
- You're cold. What if I shaved my head as penance?
-
- GARFIELD! SPEAK TO ME!
- Hmm, my decoy sprung a leak. Garfield, I have to admit you tenacity.
- You've pulled some dumb stunts.
- But this is the worst. Feed the teeth! I like to eat from each of the three basic food groups: what's in my bowl...
- What's on Jon's plate...
- And what's left over. GARFIELD! I'm tired of having the same thing for dinner every night...
- GLUP!
- Nothing? ...nothing. DRIP Z

- POOMP!
- DEATH TO THE DINGLE BALLS! This is called a ""cat's cradle"".
- It's amazing what one can do with just a piece of string in a few short minutes.
- Help. Simply amazing. Well, Garfield glued me to the chair again.
- When will I ever catch on to his tricks?
- Probably never. Jon doesn't suspect a thing.
-
- It makes me wish I was up to something. Jon! Jon!
- Jon, that's not a tongue!
- It's an alien parasite from outer space!
- It attached itself to Odie, and sucked out his brain!
- Jon, do you hear me?! We have to do something! Jon?!
- YAAAAHHHHH!! Z Garfield, for every man, there's a woman. Spare me.
- Mine is out there somewhere. Probably in hiding.
- I just gotta keep looking. I'll check under a rock. Hi, this is Suzy. I'm not at home, but please leave a message at the tone...
- Unless you're Jon Arbuckle, in which case the machine will automatically hang up. ...beep!
- This is, uh, Ed Smith. CLICK-bzzzzzzz Just amazing. After dinner we can come back to my place, my dear...
- Then we can put on grass skirts and carve monkey heads in coconuts.
- CLICK! Hello? Hence the moniker, ""Mr. Dial Tone"". I have a date!
- A date with a beautiful woman!
- DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT THIS?! Let's drink out of each other's glasses.
- How romantic!
- Actually, my last date tried to poison me. Waiter, have you seen my date? She left, sir.
- She said if you followed, I should call the police.
- Well, I guess a good night kiss is out of the question. That depends on the size of the tip, sir. Z
- Sigh
- Cloudy days are so depressing.
- Ah, there's the sun.
- There it goes again.
-

- I hate mornings. They start too early in the day.
- I hereby declare that mornings shall not start until noon. scratch scratch
- Lunch time. Take that away and bring me breakfast. BOOT!
- HEY!
- Get out of my food! You can't have this chair, Garfield. I'm not moving...no matter what!
- GREAT!
- What are you up to?! Odie, you don't like your attitude.
- It's too...dog-like.
- That's better. Now let's hear you meow. Uh, Garfield?
- Have you seen my new fern?
- Burp. Briefly. Greetings, earthling.
- I come to your planet in peace.
- Take me to your cook.
-

-
-
- So, Odie...
- Did you enjoy your bath? Looks like a good audience out there tonight.
- SPLAT!

- Meow meow. Okay, I'll bite. Meow.
- I've communicated with a lower life-form! I've been doing that for years. Garfield, this is for you! For me?!
- This is an empty box!
- Cats like to play in empty boxes. Get an empty cat. Here, Garfield, a ball of yarn!
-
- You're supposed to chase it. What's my motivation? I've never understood why cats like balls of yarn so much.
- I can't speak for other cats.
- Personally, I sell them and use the cash to buy candy!
- Isn't it cute the way cats like to play with a ball of yarn?
- Where's the spaghetti? Cat's are fascinating.
- Like the way they ash themselves with their tongues.
- Actually, I'm trying to get spaghetti sauce off my arm. Z

- Uh-oh.

- You sure do...
- Now, how does this door work? Large and unwieldy.
-
- I assume the electrified cookie jar was your idea. Hey! I found a dollar!
- I found another one! And another!
- Jon has a hole in his pocket. And another!
-
- So, how'd the date go? Here we are at the amusement park.
- Those rides were sure scary. We got thrown out.
- I couldn't stop screaming. He spooked the ponies. WHAT?!
- Oh, come on! I can't be THAT fat! Sorry, it's true.

- Okay, Odie. Now get on my shoulders.

- I think you have mice confused with tuna.
- See? All gone. Garfield, a mouse just stole some cheese!
- Should I be chasing this mouse or something?
- I mean, what kind of cheese are we talking about? Squeak!
- Fine! Just let him walk by!

- So by ""cat treat,"" you don't mean a a car? Do you have to stand there and shed while I'm eating?
- Not at all.
- You shed, I'll eat. No! No! I won't eat your food! You can't make me!
- Oka! Okay! Have it your way!
- Bully. If anybody needs me, I'll be in the next room.
- Sound asleep.
- In other words, if anybody needs me, though. Has it occured to you that I want to be alone?

- I take it this tickling thing is meant to be of the amusement persuasion? Ah, the traditional, ""Family Around The Hearth"".
- YAAAH!
- Followed by the traditional, ""Flaming Socks Dance"". Ooh! Ahh! Oooch! Yah! Quiet day today.
- Did I mention I rolled Odie up in a blanket and stuffed him onto the top shelf of the hall closet?
- Very quiet. Quiet indeed...

- No, wait! Vanilla! no, peach! ...strawberry!

- We're going to a fancy restaurant.
- How do you say ""chocolate milk"" in French? Le Geek. My date is very sophisticated, Garfield.

- I'll go with that.
- Feed me.
- SLASH!
- Thinking of you. Who ate the lasagna?
-
- Sometimes I worry about you, Jon. That was a rhetorical question. Jon, I want you to know I'm trying to cut down on my insincerity.
-
- I think he bought it. There's a real information explosion going on, Garfield.
- So many new things to learn!
- You no doubt are referring to the fact that the pizza delivery place has a new phone number? I've achieved ""exasperating,"" and I've achieved ""eye-popping"".

- This summer. AWWWWW. There's something special about Christmas on a farm.
- Something unique, that you can't get anywhere else.
- Such as Christmas cookies shaped like farm implements. We're visiting Jon's family for Christmas.
- It's peaceful here on the farm.
- C'mon, Garfield! We're going to play ""touch the udder"". And weird.
- Okay, you hold that steady, and I'll go up. Wait a minute!
- Why do I always have to hold the ladder? Why don't YOU hold the ladder?! Because I'm older, that's why!
- Oh, yeah? Well, I'm old enough to go up now, too! Move over! Hey, lookout! Ow! Stoppit!

- Bears! Bears! Bears! Bunnies! Bunnies! Bunnies! Tell me they were adopted. I don't know. I was out at the time. Hey, everybody, I'm back with a Christmas tree!
- Did you chop down a good one, Doc Boy? You bet! And it was eeasy to find!
- Gee, son, that looks just like the tree in our front yard. I get the feeling that's what made it so easy. Attention! Dad is going to give his annual holiday reading of ""Binky, the Clown wo saved Christmas!""
- So everybody gather around real close!

- An I macho? He apparently doesn't notice I have a mouthful of food. I really need to change my image, Garfield. I fully agree.
- Change can be a healthy thing. You couldn't be more right.
- We could both stand to improve our looks a little, right? Speak for yourself, donkey face. Women like men who are tall, dark and handsome.
- Do you think I could be tall, dark and handsome? You sure could.

- CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH
- I've secretly developed a taste for bricks. GARFIELD!
- FIX IT! Oh, all right.
- Jon says I'm not cheerful enough.
-
- Is this cheerful enough for you, bone brain? Get ready for a fancy gourmet meal, Garfield.
- VOILA!
- A hot dog dressed in a little tuxedo?
- Hey, Garfield, watch me impress the chicks with my mime act. You look like a kitchen match.
-
-
-
-
- Ow. Ah, ah, aaah...you're not supposed to talk. Life is funny.
- Ha! Ha! Ha!
- For some of us. Jon has thrown caution to the wind.
- He has the crazed look of a manliving on the edge.
- He's wearing his undershirt inside out. Jon's out frolicking with mother nature.
- RABID MOTH!
- I warned him...the woman's a maniac. Feeling dull? Want to seem more exciting?
- Hang out with someone even duller!
- What is it, Garfield? ** ** *

- He's never happier then when he's wearing his musical socks. Jon and I had a little disagreement this morning.
- But I handled it in a mature manner...
- You broke my crayons! Considering what I had to work with. cheeerip cheeerip
- cheeerip cheeerip Night sounds don't have to be scary. For instance, that's the sound of a cricket...
- CREEEEK That's the house settling.

- And those...
- Are Jon's glow-in-the-dark boxer shorts. Jon, you look like you're in a bad mood.
- Was it something I've said?
- Or was it several things I've done? By golly, I'd like to see less indifference around here!
-
- What do you think? Up to you. BARK! BARK!
- BARK! BARK!
- It's no use. We'll never catch that ice cream truck. I have my eye on you.

- ...on ""Science Fiction Theater!""
- Weird. click Kill the mouse!
-
- How about if I get him interested in bungee jumping and hope for an accident?
- Look at that cat.
- Too bad old Bowser isn't here. He was a good dog.
- Old Bowser would have made an orange hat out of him.
- Old Bowser would have made a cat taco with him.
- Yep, too bad old Bowser isn't here. He was a good dog.
- I hope they buried him deep. Every time I look at you, you're either eating or sleeping.
-
- I'd be happy to choose one and stick with it. Garfield, you weigh too much. I hear you, Jon.
- I want you to lose weight, and I mean now! Yessir.
- Where are you going? To a planet with a weaker gravitational pull. Odie! I have a treat for you, Odie!
-
- Nice try, Garfield. Garfield? I'm not Garfield. Dessert!
-
- The son of dessert: part two! Linda, I'll bet there's nothing you'd rather do than go out with me tonight.
- Uh-huh...
- She'd rather swin in piranha-infested waters dressed as a meat loaf. I'll bet you were a close second. Well, mister eating machine.
- Thanks to your six-hour lunch, you missed dinner.
- I'll starve!
- BEWARE OF BOOGA
- ""Beware of Booga""?

- BOOGA! BOOGA! BOOGA!
- You should exercise, Garfield.
- I'm already so tired, it doesn't seem necessary.
- Any chance you might actually move today?
- An earthquake is always a possibility. I wish something exciting would happen.
-
- Not to ME of course. Always think before you act.
-
- How about if I think and then just lie here? I'm thinking seriously of going into the next room.
-
- Unless you'd like to bring the room in here. You're worthless. Sigh.
- Every day is just like another.
- If you're doing things right. GAR-FIELD!
-
-
-
-
- SPLOT!
- Impressive. Did you catch the triple lutz? Well, look who finally got up.
- Is it Garfield, or Mister Grumpy?
- We don't like Mister Grumpy. And Mister Grumpy doesn't like you.
- BIBUU BIBUU BIBUU BIBUU
- I hate that, you know! I know. I go to the pet store to buy you something nice.
- But do you appreciate it?!
- NOOO! I'M WEARING KITTIE SHOES! So, Linda, I'll meet you there at seven.
- Me? ...oh, I'm tall and handsome with rippling muscles.
- I love blind dates! I'll get the inflatable biceps. Hey, Odie, I bought you an automatic doggie door.
- BEEP ZIP!
- And I installed it. This looks okay, doesn't it?
- ""Okay"" doesn't do that outfit justice.

-
- I think I just zinged myself. C'mon, Garfield, snap out of it. Birthdays aren't that bad.
- After all, aging is all in the mind. Of course it is.
- And the mind is the first thing to go. Here, Garfield, you got some mail. Me? Really?
- It's from my mom. How nice.
- She chrocheted me a birthday card. Garfield, have you though about what you want for your birthday? A gazillion slave dogs!
- Since you're turning sixteen it should be something special. World domination!
- How about a large pizza with everything? Even better! Garfield sure has been upset about getting a year older.
-
- Z It's true! I AM getting old! I'm losing my hair!
- Oh, no! Are you shedding AGAIN?!
- Oh...yeah.
- WHAT A SURPRISE!
-
-
- WHAT A SURP
-
-
-
- SURPRISE!!! Exercise would give you more energy.
-
- Thanks for the warning. I bought you a seafood lunch, Garfield.
-
- They had a special on ugly fish. Quick, I'm losing my appetite. I honestly didn't think you could get any fatter, Garfield.
- But noooooooo. I was wrong.
- Don't be so hard on yourself, Jon. This is a funny book!
-
- Well? Garfield, I bet you're bigger around than you are tall!
- Hey! Hey!
- I can't help if I'm short! This has been a pleasant day.
-
- No need for Jon to know.
-
-
- All right, Garfield. Let's have it. Spit it out!
- PTOO splat!
- C'mon, the rest of it!
- PTOO tap tap tap It's nice to see you, Garfield.
- Really?
- I feel safer whan you're in plain view. Staying cool during the summer is all mental.
- If you just THINK ""cool"", you'll BE cool.
- Of course, others may use different approaches. Do we have any more tape? AH
- CHOO! snif Odie is thrilled to see me.
-
- Okay, he's just thrilled. Uhhh...

- And here are the holes I cut in it! I just wrote a poem!
- I just tore up a poem! rip rip rip rip rip
- I don't do enlightenment. knock knock

- You're not very patient, are you? Not when I have to wait. Bad news, Jon.
- No matter how many times I run your blazer through the blender, it just won't make a decent milk shake.
- Sorry. Why, thank you, Garfield. What's this brass button doing in here?
- Hm...the little light in the refrigerator has burned out.
- Thisdinky thing was never bright enough anyway.
- Better.
- A snack should help me sleep.
-
- GARFIELD! Well, well, well. Keeping busy, I see.
- That's right.
- I'm collecting sarcastic remarks! Mailman's here.
- AIEEEEEEEE!
- What was that? Well now, possibly there could be a large, unattractive insect in the mailbox...maybe. I'm going to the store. Is there anything you DON'T want?
- Uh, no.
- But, thanks for asking! SPLAT!
- Coffee? Please.
- Service is getting very slack around here. As far as you're concerned, all I'm good for is feeding you.
-
- You say that as if it were unimportant. Boy, am I depressed.
- I know! I'll invite all my friends to a party!
- Gee, I was hoping for a bigger turnout. Then next time invite your enemies. rattle rattle

- Hi.
- By the way, we're out of garlic. What's for supper, Jon?
- CAT FOOD!?
- Life is full of surprises! Nobody likes a sarcastic pet. Poor Jon...
- He's the kind of guy who'll give you the shirt off his back.
- And there are no takers. Garfield, I have a date tonight! I'll alert the media.
- I have to make a good impression. Then stay home.
- Should I wear shoes? Been a while, hasn't it Jonny boy. I like to think of myself as a role model for you boys.
-
- Urf? Yes, that means we get to blame everything on him.
-

-
-
- klack! Garfield! You ate ALL cupcakes?! You're a greedy pig! You're right.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Like it? It's called remorse without guilt. I love chocolate cake!
-
- Love is fleeting. PURR PURR PURR
- Garfield, are you purring?
- No, but I think there's something wrong with my chain saw. beep beep boop This phone bill says it all.

- Earth's orbit around the sun is slowly deteriorating. One day we'll fall to a fiery demise!
- Not that truth. Your sister has mange? Hack! Cough! The weight's too much! I'm a goner!

- Don't answer the door. When shopping for a Christmas tree, there are two things to keep in mind...
- One: look for a tree with soft, supple needles.
- And two: your ceiling is never as high as you remember.
- GARFIELD!
- Spread those around! Okay, Garfield, the lights are all hung! Plug 'er in! This is the moment I look forward to every year.
- FZZZZT
- The annual blowing out of the neighborhood power grid. RATTLE RATTLE RATTLE Hmm...a nice loud rattle.
- That's a good sign.
- That means it's no underwear. Look, Garfield, we got another Christmas card!
- ""Merry Christmas, you sow.huggin', cow-kissin', sissy, city boy"".
- I think it's from Doc Boy It must be. He spelled his name wrong.

- AhHA!! NOG breath! Curses. You know, Garfield...
- Santa KNOWS whether you've been good or bad all year.
- Does he give points for being ingratiating? What did Santa say when he got stuck upside down in the chimney?
- !OH !OH !OH
- Ow! No hard candy! Ow! Ow! Sigh...I love the holiday season.
- The lights, the presents, the caroling...
- GARFIELD!!! The (burp) Christmas cookies... I know how excited you are about Christmas, Garfield...
- And I know it's Christmas eve...
- But it's only noon! Quiet! The sooner I get to sleep, the sooner it'll be tomorrow! Sigh
- What a great Christmas, Garfield.
- The tree is beautiful, the ham was delicious...
- And the presents were terrific.
- But the best thing about Christmas is being together.
- If I could only find you. Who said that? Urf? Christmas is over.
- Better change into something more appropriate.
- That sweater mom made you for Christmas looks good on you, Garfield. So what's the catch?
- And it fits good, too. There's gotta be a catch.
- And it's 100% cow. There MUST be a catch. Next year I resolve to grow chest hair!
- Ahem.

- TALLYHO!!
- New year, new start, new world, same Jon. You know what the world needs?
- More sugary treats!
- Love! What are you? Some kind of a nut? Bad news, Garfield. I forgot to buy cat food!
- Oh, no!

- I don't know.
- Before I could taste it, it got up and walked away. Be careful, Garfield.
- That coffee is hot.
- Thanks for the warning. One more sip of coffee would probably be a mistake.
-
- I know my caffeine. Jon says if I run fast, I can avoid exercise!

- He moved his family thousands of miles across uncharted territory.
- They were very brave. ""I hear a can opener,"" he kept saying. Jon, did you say I should, or should NOT stop bothering you?
- GO AWAY!
- Not until you answer my question. Oh, great. A new mouse hole.

- What's that? Standard lease agreement. I'm improving my mind.

- And spies a diet on the horizon. You have a bad attitude about this diet, Garfield.
- To successfully diet, you have to want to diet.
- It's hard to find a reason to diet when your wardrobe always fits. Jon's right! I'm going to approach this diet with a positive mental attitude!
- With a smile on my face.
- And a frown in my stomach. Don't eat those doughnuts! You're on a diet, Garfield!

- So I sent him out for a nice walk...
- Which seems to have done some good! I maimed three squirrels. Hello, fatso.
- Hello, shredded shirt.
- I've never been in better shape in my life!
- *I* have!
- I guess I topped him! You're lazy, Garfield. I happen to be conducting a scientific experiment, thank you.
- Lazy, lazy. I'm testing the first law of physics...
- Lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy! ""Bodies at rest tend to stay at rest"". Woof woof Meow meow Blah-dee-blah-dee-dah

- You never hug ME like that. With all due respect, you're no teddy bear. Sigh
- HUGGG
- Thanks. No problem. How was your meal, Garfield? Fine, thanks.
- And how about you, Pooky? Are you STUFFED?
- I'm not even going to dignify that with a grin. That concludes tonight's program.
- Next on ""nature world""...
- The bear...friend of man? Or vicious killer? What do you want to do today, Pooky?
- PLOP

- Are you packed yet, Garfield?
- All set. As usual, Garfield, I'm going to have to dress you up to take you on the airplane.
- Well, I guess this outfit isn't so bad...
- Considering... Where's Odie? I hop he's okay.
- Relax, Jon. How much trouble could he get into on a plane? I wonder how you make these seats recline.
- Maybe this little button does the trick.
- Nope. That's not it.
- The captain apologizes for the slight turbulence.
- This also concludes the meal portion of your flight.

- Sorry, we don't allow pets.
- Very well, he'll sleep in the car. Hey, where's the bed in this room?
- SLAM!
- Here it is, Jon. ...Jon? Let's hit the beach! What the?
- Natives here wear palm fronds, so I'm going to blend right in!
- When in Rome, do as the Romans do! So this is dorkland. You going to a costume party?
- I thought people from Guano-Guano wore palm fronds. Not since the investation of leaf weasels.
- WOAH! HEY! WOAH! MUNCH CHOMP MUNCH Kind of sad, isn't it? Not ot mention indecent. Look, Garfield, a sheell. Jon.
- If you put this on your ear, you can hear the ocean! Uh...Jon?

- Isn't this exciting? A real tropical restaurant! Ahem.
- Uh, the only thing on the menu is ""unguah"". What's that? You don't want to know.
- Not even a hint? Trust me. You don't want to know.
- Okay, we'll take three orders. Excellent choice, sir.

- Oh...never mind.
- Walk into a closet again? Smart guy. It's time for the weather!
- But, there was no weather today!
- Hey! This job is easy when you don't get out of your chair. Tell me about it. Jon's mother made him a new sweater.
- And he looks great in it!

- How can I chase him if he isn't moving? Can you reach the mouse, Garfield?
- No.
- But I can reach his refrigerator! Jon, I'm circulating a petition asking that the mouse move out.

- I'm just calling to confirm the appointment for your cat's booster shot...
- PANT PANT PANT PANT
- The shot will be worth it just to see him try and explain that. Today I'm going to share with others!
-
- As soon as I find others with things I want. Today is Odie's birthday, not that you care!
- Hey! I care!
- There's a cake here somewhere, right? Great to see you, Odie!

- Boys, it's a beautiful day! Why don't we drive out to the beach?
-
- Besides, the TV is broken. Surf's up! Well, I guess I'll get undressed.
- ZIP I planned ahead and wore my swimming trunks under my pants.
- EEEK! YAAAHH! SHRIEEEK! Gee, nobody can wear a pastrami on rye the way you can, Jon. Garfield! Odie!
- C'mon now...I don't look that bad...
- Do I? C'mon, Garfield! Let's play with the beach ball!
- C'mon, it'll be fun! Let's play! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
- Hey, that WAS fun! What was it that I liked about the beach so much?
- Oh, yeah...I remember.
- Absolutely nothing. Say, how about you and me doing some boogieboarding?

- I met the worst bully ever. Yeah?
- He made me throw sand in my face. sounds like one bad dude. tap tap
- SHRIEEK!
- WHAT?! Are you over that sunburn yet? I awoke to songbirds outside my window, Garfield.
- Serenading me with sweet song.
- Welcoming the morning. Tomorrow we should be able to sleep in... Jon wanted to mow the lawn.
- I wanted to sleep.
- We reached an agreement. I shouldn't kick Odie. BOOT!
- CRASH! I really shouldn't.
- You shouldn't eat all the ice cream. I really shouldn't. Z

- So, scare me. I hate that sign. click click click click
- Nothing good on.
- Dogs are stupid. Hold on. That's odd.
- I'm having trouble getting a date.
- Shut up! I made one little gagging noise.

- THIS DOES NOT WORK!
- NOW I'M SITTING IN THE GLUE!! So much for model building. Hmmmm
- I haven't purred in a long time.

-
- You're not supposed to like it! You can tell a lot by observing people, Garfield.
- Take Mrs. Feenie for example.
- She seems stressed. He has a bat caught in her hairnet. EEEERRRRRGGHHHH
- NNNNGGGGHHHHH
- Hey! Pickles! Help yourself. I'm too tired to eat. There are a few things about you that could use improvement.
-
- When did Jon start talking to himself? Like my new suit, Garfield? Define ""like"".
- I have a special date tonight. Define ""special"".
- She loves how I dress. He's dating a clown!
-
- There's something wrong with the freezer. And we're out of ice.
- Call the rescue squad!
- Jon! It's Odie!
- He's trapped up a tree!
- He can't get down!
-
- Odie appears to be tied to that branch. Do you suppose the rescue squad could pick up a pizza on the way over? Oh boy, here it comes!
- ** I love a parade! *
- Look mommy, a marching band! I hate you. Garfield, when you and your stomach won't fit through the door, what should you do?
- Make the doorway wider?
- Lose weight! Remodeling would be easier. The weight is eight ounces.
-
- You have gained one pound. Life's not fair. Garfield, I'm back!
-
- And you're back on a diet. Rats. Garfield is going to lose some weight. Hey!
- He's on a sure-fire diet. Yo.
- The ""too-fat-to-reach-food"" diet. How about a hand here? GEEZ You're fat!
- ""Geez you're fat""?! Is that ALL you have to say?! No.
- Your feet stink, too. Garfield!
- Dinner!
-
- CRUCH
- MUNCH MUNCH
- snif
- WAAHH! So, how goes the diet?
- WOAH!
- I guess THAT answers my question. Remember, Garfield, if you cheat on your diet...
- You're only hurting yourself!
- Ouch! Hold it right there! You KNOW what's going to happen...
- You're going to step on. I'll tell you youre fat. Then you'll loose your temper and stomp me flat.
- Well, shall we get started? Hop on, tubby. Garfield, I want to congratulate you on sticking to your diet.
-
- Mustard. This diet is driving me nuts! I've got to stop thinking about food! DING-DONG **
- Cookie Cookies Cookie
- EEEYAAHHH!! EEK! Cat, let's make a deal...
- From now on we'll be nice to each other, agreed? Agreed.
- OK. Now...slowly put the bowling ball down. It's an uneasy truce.
- SLURRP
- AAAHHHHH
- SLURRRRRRRRP AHHHHHH
- SLURR GARFIELD!!
- Do you realize what an annoying habit that is?!
- Yes. I flirted with a pretty girl today, Garfield.
- Our eyes met. She smiled sweetly.
- Then her boyfriend made me eat my socks. You'll always have the moment. What happened to the leftover meatloaf? It's no longer with us.
- Burp.
- I stand corrected. BARK! BARK! Nice collar.
- Do you really like it?
- I mean... BARK! BARK! BARK! Hi, Jon.
- What's with the feathers?
- Leftovers. I'm on my way to a party!
-
- To put a stop to it, no doubt. I know what you need, Garfield.
- You need to be reassured of my affection.
- You need a pat on the head. I need to know if I'm in your will. The fence for two please.
- Right this way, my dear.
- What's going on here?! You promised me a show and a dinner!
- Yes, I did.
- Here's your show. tappity tappity tappity tappity
- SPLUT!
- And here's your dinner. Do you know what I saw in the living room last night?
- A mouse! And do you know what that means?!
- Somebody's not doing his job! Am I really needed in this conversation? YOU are a cat!
- THAT is a mouse!
- Pleased to meet you. SLAP! YANK!
- GARFIELD! Hee hee hee.
- So I suppose you're going to blame the cat. Nature compels me to chase that mouse.
-
- Taxi!
-
- This has gone too far! This mouse call drives 'em nuts.
-
- It sounds like swiss cheese aging. blah blah blah blah
- We'll be right back after this message.
-
- ZOOOM!!
-
- SHOOOM!
- And now back to our show. The moon is full, and an eerie creaking is heard as a coffin lid slowly opens...as..
- COUNT CAT once again stalks the night!
- GARFIELD! BRING MY BATH TOWEL BACK! Count Cat steals through the inky night...
- Searching for a fresh neck to bite...
- Or maybe a nice tongue. Count Cannie! How good to see you again!
- Come, we must dine together.
- I'll split a neck with you. Count Cat's ghastly reign of terror continues!
-
- It's midnight.
- Dark and stormy.
- And I'll bet there's a full moon. Where do you keep the livestock? Do not resist me!
- There's no such thing as a vampire cat!
- It's just as well. Cakes don't have necks anyway. Hmmmm...
- It's that time of night.
- Time to sneak out to the fridge for a midnight snack. SNEAK SNEAK
- SNEAK SNEAK SNEAK
- CLICK
-
- AAARRRRGGHHHH!! Hee hee hee
- What are you plotting, Garfield? I'm not plotting anything.
- I already did it.
- Why don't you two cheer up?
- Much better. ""Look, Suzy, here comes Mister Mailman.""
- That reminds me, I have to check the traps.
- "" MISTEr MAILMAN IS OUR FRIEND, SAID SUZY!""
- Keep reading.
- I'm practicing looking innocent.
- Garfield, would you happen to know who emptied the refrigerator? With a face like this? I remember the glory days of my youth.
- Saturday nights cruising the main drag...
- 'course I had to have the tractor back by ten. Sigh. I have a new, positive outlook on life!
-
- Which is no doubt doomed to failure.

- Hmmm...definitaly the polka dots.
- It's almost new year, Garfield, and you know what THAT means...
- We get to hang up a NEW calendar!
- Not since the heady days of the sock drawer reorganization has this household witnessed such excitement.
- You know, Garfield...
- With a new year up to us, it's good to sit and reflect.
- To talk of what was, and what can be. Just you and me, pal.
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, you're saying we didn't get invited to a new year's party! HAPPY NEW

- Depends on where you're sitting. Garfield, I'm coming in now! Boy, am I in trouble.
- You'd better not be in my chair! I'm scared.
- I'm coming in now! Wake me after the beating.
- Garfield, I think you're a bad influence on Odie.
- Prove it. Meow. Just look at that beautiful day out there!
- Okay.
- Now what? A lack of communication...there's the problem, Garfield.
- THUMP THUMP We must reach out to touch others.

- Garfield, my fish is gone!
- And there's a potato in the fishbowl!
- You must think I'm stupid1 He's been feeding that potato for two weeks. Jenny, this is Jon. Wanna go gout tonight?

- Suppose someone else wanted some of that cake?
- Duh! ...that's why I ate it so fast. Lassie, come home!
- Make me.
- The true story. It's friday night, Garfield.
- This weekend I'm going to let it all hang out.
- I'm going to play the accordion wit hmy feet! Let's talk quality of life here. I resolve to be more decisive!
-
- Have you decided what you wanted for dinner last night?
-
-
-
-
- Only one cookie left.
- Do you know wht that means? That I get to eat it?
- That YOU ate all the others! Oh, well. That too. One last cookie.
- One last rock-hard, bottom-of-the-pile, ten-week-old, stale, crusty cookie.
- You're going to take it, aren't you? Indeedy-do. If you take that last cookie, I'll be very sad.
-
- pat pat there, there. The last cookie.
- You know you could be a real great guy and let ME eat that.
- Or, you could be a cat. Once, just ONCE I'd like to get the last cookie!
- Why, thank you!
- Sucker. One last cookie.
- I swa it first.
- You also saw it last.
-
- BONK!
-
-
-
- SPLAT! Want something from the store, Garfield?
- A rubber mouse? A ball of yarn?
- ...a satellite dish? A blue one! Uh-oh. I was touching my toes, and my back gave out.
- Do something, Garfield!
- Ow! I cut myself!
- Ouch! I burned my finger!
- I think I'll order a pizza. ""Cooking for Klutzes"". Garfield, may I have a word with you?
- Can you explain this? This is a wild guess, but I'd say you're on the phone.
- Have you been playing with the glue again? WHOA! You gotta show me how you do that! Garfield, meet Darla. Hi, I'm Darla.
- Finally, my intellectual equal.
- Hi, I'm Darla. Don't flatter yourself, Jon. People ask me why I play the accordion.
- Know what I say?
- Because I was born to boogie! He was abandoned as an infant and raised by nerds.
- click
- Jon! This is Harold, your rare and expensive talking parrot!
- The cat is stalking me!
- I'm making this tape to...NOOOOoooo!
- AIEEEE!
- GARFIELD! Burp! Garfield, I just saw a mouse!
- It's in the kitchen!
- It's pushing a tiny shopping cart! Is this going to involve getting up?
- How come I just saw a mouse running across this table?! Normally you wouldn't.
- But Fat Eddie's pretty slow. There are mice running all over this house, and there you lie!
- ...and you call yourself a cat!
- Moo. This mouse will die!
- Which stands to reason.
- I mean, he's not getting any younger. Hey, mouse. The mouse doesn't live here anymore.
- Then who are you? I'm a saber-toothed screaming lemur.
- Okay, good news-bad news time... Your owner doesn't seem to like us.
- Well, he's got this thing about mice...
- You mean the part where he stands on a chair and screams? That too.
-
- SMACK!
- Garfield!
- Give me that comic book!
-
- YAAAAHH! Here's my sixth-grade report card!
- My parents were so proud.
- ""Jon hav not shoved any crayons up his nose this term"". Garfield, my hairline is receding.
- But it really isn't noticeable.
- HEY FOREHEAD BOY! Just a lucky guess. The National Cat Channel presents...
- Ed The Wonder Cat, in the action adventure...
- ""Hairballs From Outer Space!"" Not every cat can wear tights. This book contains many great insights into life.
-
- And when you connect the dots, it forms a picture of a bunny! That was a terrible date.
- We went to the circus.
- A clown accuesd me of copying his suit. How low can a clown stoop? A letter from home!
- Your family never foregets.
- ""Dear Ron..."" Ouch.
- Odie, can we talk?
- You always have that one stupid smile on your face.
- Give me something new.
- Nope.
- Nope.
- Nope.
- And, hope.
- Who am I to mess with imperfection? ""Sleek and streamlined...""
- ""The cat's lighning reflexes make him a formidable hunter"".
- It's the off-season, okay? It's cute the way a cat will playfully bat a ball of yarn around.
-
- BAM BAM BAM BAM Maybe ""cute"" isn't the right word. ""When agitated, a cat will arch its back and hiss"".
-
- Yeah, right. Iusually send a stern fax.
- STROKE STROKE STROKE STROKE STROKE
- PURRRRR How to start a cat. Here, Garfield, for you.
- A catnip mouse!

-
- Not yet. Here, Garfield, try this coffee. It's espresso. Why the dinky cup?
- SLURK!
- Well, what do you think? I'll let you know as soon as my back teeth stop wiggling. The adventures of Ed the Wonder Cat!

- The view at the top is spectacular. Nope. No way.
- Did I mention I've installed a cappucino machine? This tree is good. That's it! This is the last tree I'm ever going to climb!

- How long have you been hangig up here? Two hours. And you?
- Three weeks. Ready, boys?
- Time for the ""Rite of the Daisy""! Spare me.
- We dress as daisies to be one with them. Yeah, don't want to stampede them.
- Ode to a daisy, by Jon Arbuckle. (ahem) ""The noble daisy makes nary a sound. It doesn't fly, it's stuck in the ground...
- But for such a thing that grows in the dirt...it sure don't make mine own eyes hurt""
- Well, what do you?...
- Oh, no! What did I do? Just promise me you won't write a poem about pets. Look, Garfield. There's Mrs. Jones.
- Good morning, Mrs. Jones. tap tap
- She hates to be disturbed. Especially when she's walking her brick. Spring is here, Garfield!
- Bringing joy to the world!
- Even you are smiling! I ate a robin. Odie and I are going to be more friendly.
-
- Not with each other, of course. Today I'll be preparing my special ""soup surprise"".
- People ask, ""what's so surprising about soup""?
- You see, there's a little man inside the pot... Guess who's been hitting the vanilla extract` Sorry, I don't take bribes.
-
- Now THREATS, I take. Hop on, skinny. The sun has failed to rise! The earth is plunged into darkness!
- The temperature will drop! PLants will wither! We shall surely starve!
- YAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!! Some days I'm soooo happy he can't talk.

- Jon, meet Clive, my invisible friend.
-
- Clive thinks you're boring. Invisible friends like Clive are great.
- They're always there when you need them.
- Uh...I think. So. Clive, where were you born?
- Invisible county hospital? Never heard of it.
- Yeah, right. Never seen it either. Odie, this is Clive, my invisible friend.
- SLURRRP!
- Here Clive. Have an invisible towel. My invisible friend Clive and I are going to play catch.
- KONK
- Bad hands, Clive! Invisible friends can come in handy.

- STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- You stomped on my ""Crispy Crunchies"". Jon, I am not a morning person.
- Is that book doing you any good,Odie?
- ARF! I thought so. You dropped something, Garfield.
- Oh, you mean the secret plans for world domination by cats?
- Uh...I mean. Meow. My credit cards are missing.
- Garfield, have you seen my credit cards? No.
- And, nice suit. It's Italian. Nancy, I'm having a party...
- Of course, I'll be there.
- CLICK Hello? I had a pet named Henry back on the farm.
- Then one evening, there was Henry on the dinner table.
- I loved that snake. Times were tough.
- ?

-
-
- MOUSE!
-
- CHAIR! Garfield, can I talk to you about the mice?
- Mice?
- Ohhhhh...THOSE mice? Get the mouse!
- How's your schedule for the 25th? Say, late morning? I'm out of town. How about the 27th, around 2ish?
- Works for me. I'll have my people confirm with yours. Sigh
-
-
- Atta-boy, Garfield! Way to go!
- Same time next week? Sure, but do something about that breath, will ya? GARFIELD!
- You're a cat...why don't you chase mice?! It's too noisy.
- All that creaking, and gasping, and wheezing, and painting, and...
-
- URK!
- COUGH COUGH COUGH HACK
- HAAACK
- All right! A Coupon!
- Well excuse me for being thrifty! Here comes Jon.
- Watch me pretend to be interested in what what he says.
- You're pretending to be interested in what I'm saying, aren't you? Fine, thanks! And you? THUD!
-
- ""Bouncy"" would not be a good nickname for Odie. And now to discuss man-eating plants, our gardening expert, Steve!
- HELP! It's got me! rustle rustle rustle
- burp That should help the ratings. Everyone should have a cat like you, Garfield. CHOMP SNARF
- GOOBLE GULP CHOMP SNARF SNARF
- Why should I be the only one to suffer? Hey! I have a blind date tonight, Garfield.
- Know what that means?
- HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP! You haven't seen your date yet. One last cookie...
- We've been friends a long time now, right? Wait! Before you try to lay heavy guilt on me.
- Okay, go ahead.
- Jon's building a ship model. I shall narrate.
- BLOOP First, he spills the glue.
- Then, he makes a hopeless mess.
- YAAAAAAH! Then he freaks out.
- CRASH!
- You are fat...
- And ol.
- And touchy. *beep* One...two...three...
- What is this? Special feature.
- The automatic chin counter. You have lost five pounds.
- Hey!
- Pay up, pal! One last chance, scale.
- I'm going to weigh myself, and I want to be accorded some respect, okay? Sure, hop on.
- You are fat, siiiirrrr. Tell me I'm not fat!
- O.K., you're not fat.
- Thank you. Sigh...I'm a disgrace to household appliances everywhere. The pizza was delivered by a woman.
- A pizza woman?
- MARRY HER! munch munch
-
-
-
- Pretty lame attempt, Garfield.
- If you want to put one over Ol' Jon, you'll have to do better than.
- ZIP There goes old man Higgins
- They say he's the meanest man on the block.
- I think he's misunderstood. The man has a clown strapped to the hood of his car. We're going to change the way we do things around here!
- Whoa...
- We do things around here? BURP!
- Garfield, yould you mind eating a little more delicately? burp burp burp burp burp burp burp A letter from dad! Whoopee-do.
- The crops are fine. The cows are fine. Yeah, yeah.
- Mom got a nose ring, and plays drums for a band called ""Electric Dentures"". Same old, same old. Jon, I ate too much.
- I need something to settle my stomach.
- How about some dessert, Garfield? The man's a miracle worker! Garfield's tongue is burned.
- How did that happen?
- He was licking a waffle iron. I saw crumbs.
- * BOOP Hey!
- * BOOP BEEP BOOP This sthing plays little notes!
- **BOOP BEEP BOOP BOOP BEEP BEEP BOOP BOOP * I can play a song!
- Garfield, what are you doing?
-
- ***** Are you packed for the fishing trip, Garfield? Yup.
- Got everything.
- Cornmeal, butter, eggs, tartar sauce, buns, deep fryer and 200 miles of extension cord! Okay, Garfield, we're going to back the boat into the water.
- W'wan back. Let me know when to stop.
- That's good. Let's see...which lure should I...ah...AH...
- CHOO
- YAAHH! How about the one in your left nostril? Watch the distance on this cast, Garfield! It's gonna be a new world's record!

- YAHOO! COME TO PAPA!
- GET THE NET, GARFIELD! GEt THE NET! For the fish, or for you? THAT is an ugly lure!
- GOT ONE!
- THAT is an ugly fish! Ugly in, ugly out. Sigh Sigh
- Y'know? Fishing's great, Garfield...the fresh air... I smell bait.
- The wildlife... Mosquitoes the size of canned hams. zzzzzzzz
- The solitude, the companionship. Stranded in a dhingy with Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
- Kinda makes a guy just wanna sing!
- * Fishing is my life...fishing is my life... ** CLONK!
- I'm attracting a more sophisticated audience.
- That was an Italian shoe.
-
- GARFIELD! See that woman over there, Garfield?
- She's flirting with me.
- I know that look. She's choking on a bagel. Here, spend some time with this rock.
- Maybe some of its charm and warmth will rub off on you.
- Heh heh. Hell, Nancy, wanna go out tonight?
- Well, does your mother have plans?
- Uh-huh...so tell me about your grandmother, is she...hello? Shot down by three generations. What's the matter, Garfield?
- Hey! Your birthday is next week!
- And that's a, uh, bad thing, right? So you're going to be eighteen soon, huh Garfield? Thanks for the reminder.
- I remember back on the farm, when I turned eighteen I really cut loose. Uh-huh.
- My buddies and I went out cow tipping.
- pant pant pant pant
- tip
-
- pant pant pant Huh? Huh? Was that fun or what? Whatever milks your guernsey. You can stop now.
-
- I told him to take it easy 18 years ago. Have you decided what you want for your birthday, Garfield?
- Try again, pal.
- What's wrong with wanting my own can opener?
- Come ON, Garfield...
- Make a wish! I'm thinking! I'm thinking! Now THAT'S a big tree.

- Okay, promise.
- STOMP! I bring you a message from the other spiders.
- phhhhht!
-
- Wait!! What?
- I've already seen that section. That's odd.
- A brown ring...
- Swat me! Swat me flat!
- I don't take orders from you!
- I guess I showed him who's boss araound...hey! Hee hee hee
-
- Cartwheels.
-
- Yikes!
- ZING! SMACK!
- Whew!
- That was close. SPLAT BRRIINNG!
- OK, I give up...you win.
- It's monday. Fine! Shoot your prisoner!
- GRAB!
- Where have you been all my life?
- I don't know, but I wish I were still there.
- Take me with you! This house is my castle, Garfield.
- My domain.
- Here, I am king. Excuse me, sire, whilst your local wretch ralphs on the royal rug. Hey there, bullet!
- Whooosh! There he goes!
- Slow down, lightning! The cat is not amused. I'm too tired to go on.
- Of course, I have no place to go anyway.
- That worked out pretty well. Man, I haven't had lasagna in, like, forever. RRRrrrrr
- What would you like for dinner? LASAGNA!
- Some steamed rice? NO! LASAGNA!
- Maybe peas and carrots? l-a-s-a-g-n-a...lasagna!
- Or, I could whip up a nice...
- Here! Noodles! Onions! Ricotta! Mozzarella! Tomatoes! Sausage!
- Or pupapth wathanya. Now you're talking. Cats are very possessive.
- We always mark our own territory.
- MINE Cats are fascinated by bits of string.
- And, I don't know why.
- If this string were a little longer, I could tie Jon up, and clean out the refrigerator. You're shedding.
- And you're watching me shed.
- Who has the problem here?
- Nice kitty, blah, blah, blah. Purr. Whatever.
- We're bonding.
-
- You are shedding a lot. Am not.
- PLOOP!
- As you can see, dogs aren't the only ones who can fetch slippers. I hate you.
-
-
-
-
- ALL YOUR MOTHERS WEAR FLEA COLLARS!
- I needed that. Garfield, I can't find my bag of...
- ZING ZONG ZANG
- Chocolate-covered coffee beans. Everybody's against me!
- SMACK SPLOT
- And I don't know why! Here comes the tickle bug!
- Tickle, tickle, tickle!
- Now, here comes the hug bunny! Pet abuse is an ugly thing. What is it, Odie? What are you trying to tell me? YIP! YIP! YIP!
- Uh-huh?...Yes?...Yes?...I see... YIP! YIP! YIP!
- Odie says he's a slobbering idiot who jumps around going ""Yip! Yip! Yip!"" I wonder if Jon knows he has something stuck between his teeth.
- YAAAHH!
- Maybe so... I'm going out to enjoy nature!
-
- Got attacked by bees and bitten by a badger. Personally, I would not have enjoyed that. Hmm...
- No...no, that's not the spot.
- No, not there either...
- No...nope...
- Nope...nooooooo...n
-
- There it is!
- Z Mice are disgusting.

- Rat hole. Manhole.
- Hey there. Buzz off!
- Oh, my! What a pretty bird!
- I like a man who loves birds.
- What are you and your bird doing tonight?
-
- Wanna pet my parrot? Does it talk? The stories I could tell, lady. You ate my food, you ate Odie's food. You ate your food.
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- What's for the dessert, dessert, dessert? Beware Of The Dog BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Beware Of The Even Bigger Dog
- Not my day. * RING RING
- Hello. May I speak with the head of the household? No.
- Cat's can't talk. Hello? Hello? I couldn't decide which one of these ties to wear.
- So I'm wearing all of them!
- Hey, hula hands! Put on some pants! This is boring.
- I know!
- This is boring with hats. A rare moment of lucidity. Anything worth having is worth working for!
- SMACK!
- So THAT'S why I don't have anything!
- rrrrrrrr
- Okay, boy, there's only one way to settle this...
- We take 10 paces, turn, and face for the food.
- Aand...one...two...three...four...five...six...seven...
- BLAT Eight...nine... I'm taking a dating quiz, Garfield.
- ""What do you look for in a date?""
- Must be same species. Except on new year's. I could get a date if I wanted. On this planet?
- I've had lots of dates! Mr. Arbuckle, time for your mediaction.
- Yep, I've broken a few hearts. That's because he showed up. Marissa! Jon here! How about going out with the King of Keen tonight?
- Jon, Jon Arbuckle.
- Yes, the dork you met in the park. King of Keen, Meet the Queen of Mean. These cellular phones are great, Garfield!
- Elle, guess where I am?...
- Uh...how far is far enough? Now he can be rejected from anywhere. I'm immature?!!
- WELL EXCUSE ME, MISS POOPIE HEAD!
- Your honor, the defense requests a recess. Another saturday night with no dat.
- Maybe I'll watch television.
- For about a year! He's working off a backlog of rejections.

- You can't sleep your life away! z
- Not if you keep waking me up! Odie! Someone has eaten your...
- Ooops. Hang on!
- Odie! Someone has eaten your food! Oh, joy. I get to spend another day with you. I'll try to control my excitement.
-
- So far, so good. That's it, Garfield.
- You've had enough.
- Just one more cup? No more coffee. That's three cookies for you.
- And a third of a cookie for me.
- Looks more like half a cookie to me. There's a cat in the neighborhood!
- Quick! Hide behind these two slices of bread!
- I gotta find a new line, or dumber birds.
- Odie! Little Timmy fell down the old well!
- Save him!
- SHOOM!
- The Old Well
-
- Odie! Now he's climbing up the water tower! Garfield, I was just outside!
- An insect flew up my nose!
- I'll be going insane any second now! How will you be able to tell? Okay, in this scene you play the part of a pitiful goofball!
- Action!
- My finger's stuck up my nose. Cut! Print! That's a wrap! You're beautiful! Garfield, some guy threw a rock through my window.
- There's a note attached!
- ""You seem boring"". We must remember to send him a thank-you rock. The fun never stops when I'm around!
-
- You cn't stop what doesn't start. Ellen won't go out with me.
- Says she has no feelings toward me...
- How about pity? I thought hitting bottom would make a louder noise. A good hat should make a statement, Garfield.
- A good hat should say...
- ""Hello, I am cool"". Or ""pity me"". Z
- Z
- RIIIINNG!
- Z
- RIIIIINNG!!
- All right! All right! You win!
- Z I hate it when you smile.
- Whenever you smile something bad happens.
- But, maybe I'm just paranoid. Release the anvil Odie suspects nothing.
- BOOT
- He still suspects nothing. Garfield!
- Did you shred the drapes into little bitty pieces?!
- Define ""little bitty"". I wonder what Jon is doing.
- RUNAWAY ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH!
- Same old, same old. You are the second most pitiful excuse for a man I have ever met!
- The second most pitiful?
- Yeeesss! I gotta meet this other guy! Cats are smarter than dogs!
- And nicer, too!
- So don't hurt me! We know here he lives.
- Sigh...
-
- Pretty dull, huh? Yeah.
- I'm gonna try another one.
- Any better? Not really. I am a poisonous spider. You are not.
- Am too. Are not.
- Here, drink this. Hmmm.
-
- Wipe your feet!
- SWAT!
- Hey, cat! I'm talking to you!
- Not so high and mighty without your newspaper, are you?!
- Would you like the rest of this sandwich? I represent the other spiders in the house.
- I've been sent to present you with an offering of peace and brotherhood.
- If you think a half-eaten fly will buy a cease-fire, think again!
-
- Help! You are pathetic.
-
-
- Don't move! We've got you surrounded!
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeaaaaah
- SMACK CLAP SMACK The Caped Avanger! Faster than a speeding delivery truck Tougher than Taffy!
- Able to eat a large pepperoni pizza in a single bite!
- ...with anchovies! Aha! It's my archenemy, the infamous Doctor Dweeb!
- Unhand that cheeseburger or receive a severe thashing!
- I hate it whe he does that. Life is a struggle between good and evil.
- Should I kick Odie off the table?...
- Or sorta accidentally bump him off the table? Hey! I can see the curvature of the earth!
- Hold it! That's my stomach.
- You're fat. Only one man's opinion. Well, Garfield, it's friday night and surf's up! Oh, no.
- You know what that means... Yes, I do.
- Beach party! He's filled the living room with sand again. How was your date, Jon?
- I forgot where we were supposed to meet.
- So, she had a relatively good time then? Boys, can we talk? Uh-oh.
- You've both gotten a little pudgy lately.
- So I'm both putting you on a fruit diet. Have fun. ""Have fun"", he says.
- The juggling Garbanzo Brothers reunite!
- * There's no business like show business ** KICK!
- FOOD FIGHT!
- Let me rephrase that...Yes, earth man? Here we are...
- ""Cat: see lazy"".
- Oh look. Here's your picture. I smell libel. Garfield, sometimes I have to ask the big questions. When's lunch?
- Like, what is my purpose? To buy doughnuts.
- Why am I here? To feed the cat. A cat's keen sense of hearing ca help him identify his prey.
- CRUNCH! munch munch munch munch
- Toast. ""Pet intelligence...""
- ""Cats do not score well on intelligence tests.""
- I'm surprised. We refuse to read the directions. Once, cats were fearless hunters...
- Independent, strong and proud.
- But, today... Could you get the plastic off this slice of cheese? Today they all stared into space for a while...
- Then they licked themselves and took naps.
- Cat news.
-
-
-
- GULP I saw that! Get up here!
- What have you got to say for yourself?!
- BURRRRRP I've been busy all day. Me too.
-
- Wait. Did you say ""busy"", or, ""sitting around doing nothing""?
- Get out of my way!
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- BARK! Would you please be quiet? BARK! BARK!
- Whoa! It never occured to me asking politely. There's a cat in the neighborhood!
- Quick! Hide in my mouth!
- Where is the trust? Where IS the trust?!
- I CAN GET A DATE ANYTIME I WANT!

- I love this time of the year.
- The colors...
- The crisp morning air...
- And the leaves...
- I love the sound they make as you walk through them. crunch crunch crunch crunch
- I love anything that reminds me of potato chips. Mr. Arbuckle, this is the ""Happy Day"" dating service.
- Well, we finally found you a date.
- Subject, of course, to her parole hearing. A career woman. Ruby, the dating service gave me your number.
- So, do you have a nickname?
- ""Widow maker"", huh? I'll be under the couch. Ruby, the dating service said we should get to know each other.
- So, exactly why were you in prison?
- Hide the potato peeler. Ouch. OK, Ruby, I'll meet you at seven.
- But how will I know you?
- I see, the tatoo on your forehead reads ""ybuR"". But, are there any distinguishing characteristics? Well, I had a pretty good time with Ruby tonight.
- She only had to be sedated twice.
- But it was hard to slow dance with that dart in her neck. That's just a little more than I wanted to know. Time to check the old mailbag, Garfield.
- *BEEP* ...you have no mail.
- *BEEP* You have also no life. Et tu, cyberspace? *
- Butter, Garfield? Yes.
- Horseradish? PLease. Mustard? Thank you.
- Anchovy paster? Just a smidge. Lard? Sure!
- Toaster crumbs? Why not?
- Garfiedl? Yes?
- YOU'RE DISGUSTING! Any sauerkraut? Catch a mouse. You didn't use the magic words.
- Catch a mouse, or you don't get dinner.
- Presto! Garfield, it's time you REALLY got tough with those mice! Right!
- BAM BAM BAM
- No video games for a week! What's the matter? My wife kicked me out of the hole.
- Why? Well, I ate this garlic bulb, and...
- There is a MOUSE asleep on my bed!
- You know what to do! z

- Hey, Garfioeld, check out my ghost costume.
- Very nice.
- Uh-huh...
- How cute

- Now where could Odie be?
- KICK!

- EEEK! Hey, Garfield, I got you an outfit for the costume party.
- What do you think? I don't know, Jon.
- I have this uneasy feeling.
- Oh, c'mon,,, that's not scary.
- Now, THAT'S scary. YAAAAHH!
- Boy, that's the scariest mask yet!
- An empty supper dish.
- You're lazy, Garfield.
- You're as limp as a rag!
- FLOP
-
- FLOP
- Although, not without entertainment value. Oh sure, humiliate the cat. Ah, monday...where is my sting?!
- WHAM
- Ah...THERE it is... I find your presence unpleasant.
- You possess many shortcomings also.
- No one is perfect. Let's go back to bark and hiss.
- You're a lazy pig!
- How did he know it was me?
-
- I hate it when he acts goofy. That was ferocious! Ann won't go out with me.
- But there areplenty of fish in the sea, Garfield. How do I say this, Jon...
- I'll just cast out another line. There's a hole in the boat, and the bait's dead. What did I tell you the last time you threw a rock in the house?!
- Lessee...don't help me...I can get this...
- Oh, yeah! It was ""YEEEEOW! Boy that hurts!""
- Would you like to hear about my day, Garfield? Rub my tummy and I'll listen to anything.
- Well, first, I went for a walk in the park, I fed the pigeons and smelled the flowers...
- Then on the way home I was nearly run over by a cab.
- I yelled at the driver, ""Hey, you! Watch where you're going!""
- Then he jumped out of the cab and grabbed me by the neck and started...
- Let's go back to the park part. I'm not going to climb you, tree.
- I don't care what you do.
- Now THAT'S unfair.
- Hey, you! Scram!
- This is MY tree. Being stuck in a tree isn't so bad.
- I'll just sit here and enjoy the view.
- ...for the rest of my life. I've been up here a long time. I wonder if I'm setting any records? Hey Ethel! Looky up there!
- That's gotta be THE stupidest cat in the whole world!
- A record! I'm drawing a crowd.
- Those people down there look like ants.
- Garfield, what are you doing? I guess they are. Stupid tree...may all your stupid branches fall off!
- CRACK
- Nice curse, Garfield.
- This meeting of the Brotherhood of Household Pests will now come to order.
- Now, this week's assignments: Jreome, you'll pester the big, dumb human... No proooblem.
- And Charlie, being a flea, you naturally get the dog. Can do, boss.
- I'll take the cat...he hates me anyway. Any questions?
- Good! Meeting adjourned!
- WHACK! Monday, I'm not afraid of you!
- In fact, I laugh into your face!
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! zzzzzzz Does that look crooked, Garfield? No.
- Now it does.
- Thanks for your help! I do what I can. Oops.
- ssssssss
- Bottom of the pot again! So, Ellen, I hear you have a party.
- Gee, my invitation must have been lost in the mail.
- She said no. And to make sure, she shot the mailman. I'll ge the checkers. Garfield, this must be an invitation to Ellen's party!
- Oh, yes, it's PARTY TIME ** ** ...it's PARTY TIME...
- It's a restraining order. Aw...and you just bought a new whoopee cushion. Sigh .
- I'm not actually bored.
- I'm just practicing. Jon's hamburger!
- I'll just eat Jon's pickle.

- That one either. Rats. Garfield, you ate the whole box of doughnuts.
- Yet you seem depressed.
- Could it be guilt?! They were my friends. Coffee, Garfield?
-
- It's a little string. It's winking at me. What are you so happy about?
-
- I was being sarcastic. This IS happy.
- Let's see now...the perfect spot...

- I'm trusting you not to peek. You have my word of honor.
- Uncross your toes. You little finks. Garfield, are you peeking at your present? No, I'm not peeeking...
- I'm taking a big fat look! Try and stop me!
- Hey! There's nothing in here! I put out a decoy. You tricked me! there's nothing in this present! You promised me you wouldn't peek.
- That's what you get for peeking.

- Thanks.
- And here's your look of disgust. *YAWN*
- You slept through breakfast... Whoop dee-doo

- I'm going to call you ""Bingo""!
- Bad Bingo! It's sounding better already. You must be one of those cats I've heard so much about.
- Am I supposed to be barking?
- Ahem...bark. First day on the job. I don't want to be disturbed!

- Say yes and I'll be happier than a hog with a mouth full of slop.
- Hello?... Platitude Man strikes out again. Think of this way, Julie.
- Going out with me is better than a stick in the eye.
- Put the stick down, Julie. Never give'm options, Jon. I'm going to impress my date, Garfield.
- She'll see how neat and organized I am.
- I'm taking my sock drawer. The Binky the Clown socks should stay home. My date is in show business, Garfield.

-
- Wiggling your ears doesn't count. Then YOU think of something. This book is about faithful pets, Garfield.
- Pets who risked their lives to protect their owners.
- You wouldn't be interested. What about the time I ate that hot pizza to save you from burning the roof of your mouth? Garfield, I'm home!
- Some pets scamper to greet their owners.
- But, not yoooou though. I believe the keyword is ""scamper"". Here comes Jon. I'd better look busy.

- Not really.
- Let's ask Jon. Maybe he knows. Those mice are too much, Garfield.
- Either they go, or I go!
- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! What's that noise? That's twenty mice dragging your suitcase down the stairs. I came within an eyelash of catching that pesky mouse today.
- I'm back from Hawaii!
- Okay, maybe it was several eyelashes. The mouse escaped.
- I mean, the mouse escaped.
- You're not fooling anybody. How about this? The mouse... Don't come out here, mouse, or you'll regret it.

- I'm pulling out all the stops.
- Yessir, I'm using the drive-up window tonight! Well hello, Mr. Snooty. Harriet, if you ever leave, I'll pull myself out by the roots!
- GULP
- Did I say ""roots""? mmmmm
- AHhhhhhh
- There's no better feeling than lying in cool grass on a warm summer night.
- Garfield, time for bed! Rats.
-
-
- Put it back
- You didn't do anything remotely resembling work today, did you?
-
- Well, dinner was kind of cheway.

- He doesn't drink it. He just spreads it around the house. Z Z
- PA, THE CHICKENS ARE DROWNING!
- Z Recurring farm nightmare. Do you know what's fun?
-
- Me neither. A rare moment of candor. May I speak to the man of the house?

- FOOF!
- Now pitch it out and order a pizza.
- Beware Of The Dog

- Was that before or after she pointed an laughed? Chicks likeintellectual guys.
- So I'm boning up on classic literature.
- ""Here's Mr. Butterly, visiting Miss Daisy...."" The man's reading a coloring book. Hey there, chicky-boo, chicky-boo-boo-boo.
- Tell me, are you obnoxious, or just plain stupid?
- That's for me to know, and for you to find out. Today we're stupid. So, Sarah, you don't care for my personality?
- Well, the joke's on you, Sarah!
- I don't have a personality! He's got her there.
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
- I have a brick in my purse. Must be a code. Sigh...
- Garfield, what is my purpose in life?
- To make others feel superior?
- AHHHH

- AHHHHHHHHHHHHH See the lazy cat.
- See the lazy cat take a nap in the road.
- See the steamroller... WAKE UP, CAT! Hey...this isn't water...
- It's CHICKEN STOCK!
- There goes my sparrow gumbo. I'm training Odie to be a watchdog.
- Now Odie, if a burglar broke into the house, what would you do?
- That is correct! Make me a ham sandwich! Got my beach ball, got my fins, got my surfboard.
- EEK!
- I'll get your trunks. This lotion is supposed to prevent sunburn.
- Want some, Garfield? Nope. Don't need it.
- I could use some eyeholes, though. What do you think, Garfield?
- You're asking the wring guy, Jon.
- To a cat, a sandcastle is nothing more than an outhouse with turrets.
- What a great day! I hate going to the beach with Jon...
- HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT!
- SHARKS!
- RIPTIIIIIiiiiide

- GARFIELD! That's it, Garfield. I've asked every girl on this beach out.
- And they all said no.
- Even the one with the hairy back? Even the one with the hairy back! This whole trip to the beach has been a complete failure!
- I didn't meet a single girl! pat pat There, there...

- Bye!
- And don't change the locks again. Sure, blame the cat! Isn't nature thrilling, Garfield?
- Nature is boring.
- You're staring at the wall. Then your wallpaper is boring. I'm in a bad mood.
-
- Relatively speaking. Look, Garfield, I made a cheese sculpture!
- Very nice.

- Oh, wait. That's MY ad. What the heck. Call. Maybe you'll get lucky. My car won't start.
- Of course, that's better than yesterday, when it wouldn't STOP.
- You say that as if I could have been the only cat who could have tampered with your brakes. All dressed up and no place to go.
- Mommy, look! It's the circus!
- No, dear. But that man is dressed like a clown!
- And there's one of those trained pigs!

- ""I wish I had a motto"". Catchy. Don't throw that brick at me. No problem.
- And don't drop it on my foot. NOW we have a problem. I worked hard all day and now I'm tired.
- Poor Jon.
- You know, it's possible to get tired without all that hard work.
-
-
-
-
-
- ALL RIGHT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! At the moment, making you nuts. Just look at you.
- Life is passing you by, Garfield.
- Make sure it shuts the door on the way out.
- FIRE!
- Every cat has two sides...lazy and spunky.
-
- Sadly, ""spunky"" is no longer with us. You haven't moved for hours.
- At least give me a sign that you're still breathing.
- Z Garfield, why don't you get up and do something?!
- YAAHH!
- Don't ever do that again! I can't win. squeek squeek
-
- I get it! Ha, ha, ha! Hey, you!

- Woo! Woo! Woo! Pretty scary, huh? Uh...yeah.
- Why don't you just percolate on along now? Oh, a wise guy, huh?!
- O.K. Mugsy, rough him up a little! Mugsy?
- You want a piece of this?! Huh? Huh?! C'mon! From now on it's a glass of warm milk before bed for me. Carlotta the crazy cow! That's your cue! I have something for you, Garfield.
- It's the Golden Slop Through Award!
- Congratulations. I'd like to thank all the little slobs. Odie was chasing his tail.

- It's better company than you are.
- You two have more in common. I'm wearing a new cologne, Garfield.
- It's called ""Canadian Love Call"".
- They say it really, really works. But, did you read the fine print? I think I'll take a walk. Me too.
-
- Well, let's go. I thought we were just thinking it. No, I understand...get well soon.
- Ever girl I've asked out is sick.

- Are you coming along? That won't be necessary.
- I'm sending nature a postcard. Would you like to go on a nature hike?
-
- Couldn't we get flowered wallpaper instead? Garfield, we're going outside. No way.
- We'll walk in the woods. I SAID I'm not going.
- We're going bird watching. I'll get my dart gun. Hello, good-looking.
- She called me good-looking!
- Hello, good-looking. Now she's talking to a tree. Look over there, Jon!
- As you can see, there are cats much fatter than I am.
- Oink. I'm sure he meant to say ""meow"". You can't improve on nature.
- You're right, Jon.
- Unless we put a hot dog stand right over there.
-
-
- Uh, Garfield... Uh-oh, he suspects something.
- Quick, do something cat-like and endearing to distract him.

- Your chewing rhythm is way out of sync!
- Go away. No, no! The fork angle is all wrong! Garfield, it's not fair that I sit here tonight...

- So much for sparrow fondue. I'm going to stand motionless in the backyard.
- Until lunch.
- If you know what I mean. Get back here! I may look like a cat, but I'm actually a REALLY big sparrow.
-
- We must do a worm sometime.
- CHOMP
- Hey! Where's my rubber ducky?!
-
- Mrs. Feeney, I may have a clue to the fate of ""Mister Sweetywings"". May I please eat you for lunch?
- No, you may not.
- Civilty is overrated.
-
- Yeees!
-
-
- The ice cubes have hardened!
- Garfield! How many times have I told you never to make eye contact with tha tman?! I'm in good mood.
-
- I wonder if I'm up to something? Starting contest!
-
- At each other, you idiot! That's odd.
- Ever have deja vu? No.
- That's ood. My future is looking bright!
-
- CRAMP! CRAMP! Has the future started yet? Ever hear one of those voices inside you, Garfield?
- A voice telling you to do something wild and crazy?...
- I'm putting on a kilt! Obeying his inner nerd. Jon isn't speking to me.
- I think.
- I'm not listening to him. Hmmm...
- I feel like a snack...maybe that last piece of pie...
- BURP
- Or those two hot dogs... BURRRRRRP BURRRRRRP
- Or the three buffalo wings... BRAAP BRAAP BRAAP
- Or the six-pack of soda pop... YURP-YURP YURP-YURP YURP-YURP
- Is there ANYthing left? How about a nice refrigerator bulb? Catch the cat! Catch the cat!
- Say, isn't that a tail?
- Catch the tail! Catch the tail! Dogs...you gotta love 'em. Beware Of Dog What's this?
- This sign is past its expiration date.
- Hi! What a pathetic excuse for a dog!
- Grrr
- Check that... Hey, dog. Your x-rays are back.
- See that tiny dot? That's your brain.
- Why can't we all just learn to laugh at ourselves?! Beware of Insulting Dog.
- I wonder what that means?
- Excuse me, SIR. When is the litter due? Ahhh. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
- Grrrrr Are you going to bark or what?
- I'll get to it! Okay?! Well, I don't have all day. Yeeeeeeessss...
- * Hmm hmm hmmmm
- Mighty fine...
- Lookin' good, big guy.
- Whaddaya think, Garfield?
- Let me see...
- By golly, you're right! Jon! I just had a terrible nightmare!
-
- Although it wasn't nearly as bad as this.
-
- Did Odie give you my message? Plain popcorn, no salt, no butter.
- Sounds good.
- It'll go great with my plain salt, no butter, no popcorn, and plain butter, no popcorn, no salt. All the food is gone!
-
- Aand...you were going somehwere with this? It's a dark and scary night, Garfield.
- They say cats can sense when evil is present.
- So, is it? No, but my geek sensor just went wild. I've gotta be me!
-
- Couldn't you be somebody else? Z
- Garfield...wake up! tap tap Z
- It's me, the leftover dork chop from the fridge...
- You should have eaten me when you had the chance, fat boy.
- Because I've glued you to your bed, and have a one-way ticket to Aruba!
- So long, sucker! nggghhgghh Z
- YAAHH Sounds like the pork-chop nightmare ""yaahh"". You only date adventurous men?
- Hey, adventure is my middle name!
- I once inhaled a cheeseball. On purpose. I can tell how interested a woman is in me by the way she strolls by.
- ZOOM
- I don't know...she was a little to blurred to tell. Ellen, know what I'd like to do?
- Run over there and sweep you off your feet!
- She's nailing herself to the floor. Ouch. Hello? Yes, this is he...a date?...with me? This friday night?!
- Pinch me, I must be dreaming!
- AAAARRRGGHH! Garfield, I'd like you to meet my date.
-
- You don't have a date, do you? I'd sure like to meet her, too. Some days everything goes right.
-
- I read that in a book. The one that gave you the paper cut?
- Well hello, Mister Butterfly.
- How lovely you are...
- Your wings like beautiful paintings...
- Your graceful flight like.
- HOOO!
- Your feet like ice cubes. Sorry. Okay, what's the grin for?
- You did something, didn't you?
- Was there any property damage or loss of life? Define ""life"". Odie is guarding his dish.
- rrrrrrrrrrrr
- And he's darn good at it, too. munch munch rrrrr DOG FOOD I had that falling dream again.
- You know, the one where I fall?
- I woke up before I hit bottom, though. That is one man's opinion.
- Okay.
- Litter box has been changed. About time. You know, Mona, I just know you're going to say you'll go out with me.
- Know why?
- I'm wearing my lucky socks. I guess the choice is out of her hands. *

- IIIIEEEE SLIP THUD
- SLURP AAAGGHH My next guest needs no introduction.
-
- Psst! You're on! Oh. Anyone for radio? Hello and welcome to ""Hit Me With A Hammer!""
- I'm your host, Twink Winkerman, and tonight we'll OW
- Suck it up, Twink, you big baby! Oh yeah?! Baby THIS! OW! Television's finest hour. This week on ""Unfinished Sentence Theater,"" we will
-
- Thanks for watch
-
- Tune in again
- AAGGGH! And now it's time to play ""Block That Kick!""
- Our first contestant is Michael!...ready, Mike? Huh?
- BOOF GAAHH THAT'S going to raise a welt. Welcome to ""Watching Paint Dry Theater"".
-
- It's a rerun. Don't tell me how it turns out! Welcome to ""Is It Good?,"" in which we invite you, the viewer...
- -to send us your old leftovers from the back of your refrigerator!
- Contestant number one...is-it-GOOD? Hmmm... SNIFF IT! SNIFF IT! Sigh...
-
-
-
- Rats!...
- I just can't get comfortable!
- Z Come on, Garfield, let's be honest. Does anything I say ever get through to you?
-
- Y'know, I think that mole on your neck is getting bigger. Time to get some household chores done.
- BOOT!
- Break time. Remember, kids, pigs are an excellent source of an important nutrient.
- Bacon grease.
- Occasionally I put the humor aside and do my part for education. Some people aren't lucky in love. Like my aunt Edna.
- They never find the right one. She married a hyena.
- But still you hope. Oh sure, he was a lot of laughs... I had a date last night, Garfield.
- She was a little older than I expected.
- Orpha, this id Jon. I have your teeth. Oh baby, baby. I have two hundred french fries in my mouth!
- You're disgusting.
- He hates to see me break his record.
-
- ?
-
-
-
- BONK OW! Maybe I'll be like you today, Garfield...
- Lazy!
- Another convert. Life is passing you by.
- Every moment you lie there is another one you'll never have back, you know. That's okay. I won't miss them.
- Especially the ones spent staring up your nose. Time for me to not do some sit-ups.
-
- How's it going? Darn. Made me lose count. Look at you...
- Just LOOK at you!
- You're lucky to have me around.
-
- Luck isn't what it used to be. It takes fewer muscles to smile than to frown!
-
- And you say I never exercise.
- I suppose you're wondering why I have this sack on my head.
- Well, I have this big, ugly zit on my face...
- And it looks so horrific I don't want it seen.
- ** DING-DONG That's my date.
- I hope she understands.
-
- SMACK
- Your birthday is coming soon. I know. I marked the calendar. Would you like a birthday party this year, Garfield? We could invite all of your friends.
-
- More cake for him. I remember my 21st birthday, back on the farm...
- We played ""Pin the Tail on the Donkey""...with a real donkey!
- I can't recall much after that. This explains a lot. You shouldn't worry about turning 21. I had an uncle who lived to be 21. Really?
- I remember what he always used to say to me... What was that?
- ""Who the heck are you?!"" This is Garfield's birthday present.
- He'll never figure out what it is.
- Not until I tuen my flashlight on... Yes, yes, I know it's my birthday.
- You don't have to rub it in.
- Then again, perhaps you do. * dingle dingle

- THOOMP
- GARFIELD!! I feel very up today, Garfield.
- Birds are singing. The sun is shining.
- And my nose rash is dissipating! I wish YOU'D disspiate. I love you, Odie.
- Always stay the way you are!
- Bronze him. Everyone has their breaking point.
- Little things that drive them crazy.
- bbbbb Like lip flipping. Walking is good exercise.
-
- But you have to take more than one step. There's always a string attached! I can't believe you ate Dicky bird!
- Never again to hear thoe little feet scampering around the cage! Relax.
- The little feet might still be in there. I bought dancing shoes!
-
- The don't seem to work. Maybe there's an on/off switch.
- Z
- UUHHNNYAHHH
- GAHOOOOOOOOOO
- HEEEEYUHHHHH
- HUHYEEEYAHHH
- Go do your sit-ups outside! ** DING-DONG I wonder who that could be.
- ** DING-DONG Oh, well, at least I know who it's NOT...he's too short to reach the doorbell.
- TAH-DAAAH! AAARRRGH! smack! Greetings, old and fat one!
- Is the door sagging, or is that you?
- You used to be cute. Now I'm precious. Nermal, what brings you here? I though I'd drop by for a short visit.
- So, you've packed on a few pounds, have't xou?
- My, my, my...that WAS a short visit! Hey, look who I found on the lawn! That's bcause I PUT him there.
- I'll leave you two to visit. So, aside from the bigger belly and extra chin, what else is new?
- Garfield, do you feel a draft? Now, Garfield, Nermal came to visit you...be nice.
- Yeah...I thought fat folks were supposed to be jolly.
- Hee, hee, ha, ho, ho, ha, ho. How do you stay so cute?
- It's a gift, chunky...a gift.
- What was that flush I heard? I just put Nermal's ""gift"" in layaway. *
- Ah, this is the life...
- Kicking back and relaxing in my very own po-...
- Garfield?! What are you doing up on the roof?
- CANNONBALL! GAAHHH
- SPLOOSH
- That was fun! Blow it up again! Kindly remove your foot from my nostril so that I may kill you. Some people travel the world.
- And here I sit with you.
- I feel sorry for them, too. Sit!
-
- Good boy! Know what drives me nuts?
-
- I'm not telling YOU. Oh, come on, I can always use new ideas. There's nothing Jon enjoys more...
- Than rubbing my tummy.
- If he knows what's good for him. Garfield, have you ever regretted any of the awful things you've done to me while I'm sleeping?
- Yes.
- This isn't one of them, though.
- I'm spending saturday night with a fat, worthless cat!
- Tht fat part was uncalled for.

- Ted's Dong Repair. Ah yes, it's good to be back at the ol' diner!
- Hi, hon! What can I get you? For starters, a spatula.
- My hands are stuck to the counter. Some things never change. Mmm...I love the smells of a diner...
- Irma, what's that smell? Something sizzling on the grill? Naw.
- That's chef Tony. I'll be hitchhiking home now. How about you ham, Irma?
- Is it fresh?
- Oink Yes. Check. I'd like a glass of juice, please.
- What kind? Orange, sauerkraut, grapefruit or pickle? Uhh...orange.
- What's this? ...your ""He-Man Burger""?
- That's a five-pound patty of ground beef on a bun. Five pounds?! Who who could eat such a thing?
- uhh-EEE-yah-EEE-yaaah thump thump thump thump This coffee is great, Irma! Thanks, hon. I ground the beans myself.
- CLOP CLOP CLOP
- Why is she wearing golf shoes? I'd rather not know.

- dig dig dig dig That's deep enough, Odie!
- AIIIEEEEEE YAH YAH YAH YAH YAAAAHHHH
- Anything interesting today? Nah, just bills. The next time I see you two, I expect you to be doing something worthwile.
- You know what that means, Odie?
- We'll never see Jon again. I have a real problem with your attitude latey, mister!
- That, and your
- Short attention span. Do you think your life can have an impact on the world?
- Absolutely.
- Have you noticed that there are fewer sparrows around here than there used to be? RING
- I won't go out with you!
- I wonder who that was? Rejected by wrong numbers! SMACK You need to eat a more balanced diet.
- Balanced?
- You mean as in more than one kind of donut?
-
- Hi, mouse. Hi, cat.
- So, what are you standing here for?
- I'm waiting for my carpool. Carpool?
- Oh, right...a mouse carpool! That's a hot one! slam! screeee
- Care to explain this? Mind if I don't? Pooky's looking a little dirty...what say I run him through the wash?
- My teddy bear is NOT dirty!
- Dusty, maybe. So long, old pal!
- Have a safe journey! sniff
- Bon voyage! You have no idea how much pressure I'm under. Pooky is in the wash this morning.
- You'll just have to find a subsitute for the next hour.
- Uh, Garfield. Shh. Pooky doesn't talk. Okay, Pooky made it through the wash cycle...I'm adding fabric softener now.
- No...this instead.
- Conditioner. Okay, Garfield, here comes Pooky...
- All clean and fresh from the dryer!
- There he is, fresh from the dryer and all clean! What do you think?
- LICK
- Missed a spot.
- DING-DONG **
-
- Mrs. Feeny is at the door.
- She claims you epoxied her weimaraner to a cross-town bus.
- Is this true? No!
- I swear! Respect is an important part of a pet-owner relationship, Garfield.
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Perhaps you wouldn't. Gee, I didn't know we had any of those flavored coffees.
-
- I found your cough drop. sniff Looky, Garfield! Looky!
- Looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky, looky,
- Hello, doctor? Could you reboove a rubber bouse frub by dose? One ""lloky"" too many.
- You missed a spot.
- Work, work, work, work, work, work, work! Mr. Smith, I'm calling to ask permission to marry your daughter.
- No, we haven't had a date yet...dad.
- That's rather unkind, Mr. Smith. We like to alienate the entire family. CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH
-
- Usually you let the seeds grow, and then you eat the plant. I'm not a spatient as I used to be.
- RIIING!
- Congratulations, lucky contestant! Answer just two questions and win, win, win!
- Question one: What is the sound a cat makes? Meyow.
- Correct! And for the GRAND prize, question two: what is the sound a DOG makes?!
- DUHHHHHHH
- I doubt if I was eligible anyway. Many viewers are asking:
- ""Can television sink any lower?""
- Let's find out! All right! Welcome to ""Scary Theater"".
- Tonight's feature: ""The Cat Who Shed on the Furniture"".
- What's so scary about
- AIEEEE! Sorry, kids, but Binky the Clown isn't feeling well today.
- Filling in for him is his brother...Mel the Accountant!
- Today we'll be discussing the importance of saving receipts... Sounds funny coming from a guy in a gree wig. Mr. Smith, you say you can communicate with plants? That's right.
- Hello, Mr. Plant, how are you? I am fine, Mr. Smith.
- Hey! I saw your lips move! 149 channels to go. A report states television viewing destroys brain cells.
- Let me repeat that for our frequent viewers.
- TV...duh! I am highly offended. Hey, handsome, how's your aftershave?
- C'mere...come closer...closer...
- Uh...that's close enough, dork boy. Et tu, TV?
- I'm bored.
- I have gum and a potted plant stuck on my head.
- A meteorite just crushed my car.
- And there's a gian gorilla on the roof...
- ...swatting at airplanes.
- You have gum? Jon says gluttony will kill me.
- That was true of my uncle Morty.
- He tried to take a papaya from a silverback gorilla. Odie has a personality all his own!
-
- Nobody else wanted it. I wish you wouldn't attack the mailman.
-
- YAAHH!! HELP! HELLLlllp And while I'm at it, I also wish I had a million dollars and a new car. I warned you about laziness, Garfield.
- You can't just lie around all day.
- You gotta be alert. Just open the bag. You WOULD like to go to a movie?!
- With me?!
- Rats. You had to press it, didn't you? IT'S TIME TO GET UP, GARFIELD!
- Excellent, Jon! You've never yelled better!
- Z
-
-
- Is that it? Is that the best you can do?!
- That was nothin'! Come on! Gimme your best shot!
-
- Better. Garfield, we have a mouse problem.
- Oh, you can't see them, but they're here.
- I can sense it. Cool it, guys. I had a dream that you caught a mouse.
- Sounds silly, doesn't it? Not at all.
- I have dreams all the time. Go, Garfield, go!
- All right!
- Beat him to the last cookie! That's it! If I see one more mouse around here, you're grounded!
-
- Let me rephrase that. No, no, I LIKE the concept! The mice are out of hand, Garfield!
- And that upsets me!
- Okay, everybody, group hug! Group hug! I'm moving out.
- You're going to be proud of me!
- Much better. BZZZzzzzzzzz
- Darn ol' fly. BZZZzzzzz
- ZZZZ... CLAP!
- Got him!
- BZZZZZZ
-
- BZZZZZZZZZZ
- That's no ordinary fly.
- BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ YAAAAHHH! That's a fly fueled with my coffee! Let's think happy thoughts! All right.
-
- Aren't you thinking happy thoughts? I'm not letting my face know.
- Hi'ya, Odie!
- Thanks a lot!
- Never help me with the laundry again!
- Let's hear it for incompetence. Here's a double helping of lasagna, Garfield, with a steak o the side.
- Why, thank you so much!
- And here are your car keys. Thank you so much. I'm ready for my date!
-
- Looking forward to it, are you? It's in three weeks! I just lost my job. I'm here to end it all.
- Go ahead. Swat me.
- NO. Oh, you ARE cruel. Okay, Garfield...
- I'm putting this cake here and turning my back.
- Let's see if you can withstand temptation.
- Okay, my back is turned.
- Be strong, Garfield. Hey, fat boy. You wanna piece of me?!
- You can do this. Huh?! SLAP! Huh? SLAP!
- Garfield, Garfield, Garfield. Forget it. You wouldn't believe me anyway.
-
- Coffee kicked in. Here's your coffee.
-
- Careful, it's hot. Thank you, Dr. Science. I have had two lousy days in a row.
- Today HAS to be a good day.
- The law of averages is on my side. There's a fly in your coffee. For health reasons, I've decided to give up coffee.
-
- For sanity reasons, I've decided to give up giving up. C'mon, just one more cup. Nope.
- You've had enough.
- bzzzzz And just what makes you think that? Hmmm...what do we have here?
- Let me guess.
- Hot coffee in the lap? The pain!
- Hello. Are you lookin' at me?
- Nice day. Oh yeah? Sez who?!
- They say it might rain later. Is that a threat?!
- But I hope it doesn't. Chicken!
- I'm planning to take a little walk. Go ahead! Try it! I dare you!
- Would you like to come along? Not until you apologize! Fausto's Pizza...home of the megacheese pizza.
- We got onion...we got pepperoni...we got anchovies...whaddya want?
- Hello? Anybody there? I love you, Fausto. Observe the ever-alert watchdog.
-
- Psst. That's you, dummy. WOOOOOO!
- I am guilt!
- You stole Jon't lunch! WOOOOOOOooo! The spirit of lunches past. HA! HA! HA! HA!
- Elen likes men who are able to laugh at themselves.
- HA! HA! HA! HA! I wonder what the normal people are doing? You would love to go out with me?
- You say you're thrilled I asked?
- I'm practicing. No kidding. I am a thinking human being, and you are a lowly house pet.
- WHAM!
- I meant to do that! The thinking human being missed the doorway.

- Same here.
- Except for that ""busy"" part. Huh! Lying around all day...must be nice!
-
- ...I said, MUST BE NICE! Do you hear me arguing? You seem depressed, Garfield.
- Back on the farm, we had a cure for that.
- We'd go out to the barn and tickle the goats. Touch me and die.
- scratch scratch
- That was quite burst of activity. I hope nobody got hurt. Yesterday you were here.
- Today you're here!
- WE HAVE MOVEMENT!
- I wonder if Charlie Brown could use a cat? What if I did nothing, like you?
-
- You'd never catch up.
- So, did you finish all your dinner?
- WAH HAHA YAH HAA HAA
- AHHH YAH HA HA HA HA HOO HOO
- HEE NEE HEE HEE HEE SNORT SNORT
-
- AHHH YAH HA HAHAHA Some people think the universe is constantly expanding.
- All right!
- Room for another donut! SLAP!
- Too much happiness!
- AHHH! I just finished drawing a moustache on every picture of Jon in the house!
- I jusr drew a moustache on my face!
- Troublemaker! I'll never forget my days back in school
- I'm sure.
- If I had my pants run up the flagpole every day, I'd remember it, too. My feet were cold, so I put on seven pairs of sicks.
- Then I couldn't get my shoes on.
- Then I figured, what do I need with shoes?! I'm going to go play in traffic. ""...and they all lived happily ever after"".
-
- You notice they didn't have a cat. Is that a shot? hoo hoo hoo
- hoo hoo hoo
- hoo...hoo..hoo... Stupid owl.
- hoo...hoo...hoo...
- fling! KONK!
-
- OW! I love diners...they're so warm and friendly.
- It's nice to come to a place where everybody knows everybody's name.
- HI, hon. And that name is ""hon"". How's your turkey? Great.
- How's your fish? Great.
- How's your chicken? Poor thing has a fever today. Hold the chicken. I'll have a hamburger, well-done with extra onions. You got it.
- YO, TONY! BURN A COW, AND MAKE HER CRY!
- Suddenly, I've lost my appetite. It's with mine...waiting for us in the car. Is the meat loaf good? You'll love it. It's the chef's mother's recipe, rest her soul.
- I wonder how she died? Meat loaf's up!
- I'm betting she choked on a horn. For being such good customers, here's a special treat from me! Thanks, Irma!
-
- This is a scoop of mashed potatoes in a cone. Hand me one of those butter pats. Irma? There's a hair in my chicken salad.
- Nice try, Mister Joker...
- Chickens don't have hair. All in favor of leaving... SLAM!
- I had an accident today at the salad bar.
- I smacked my face into the clear sneeze guard and knocked a crock of Garbanzo beans onto the floor.
- A fat woman slipped on them and somersaulted onto the soup-of-the-day tureen.
- Then her husband threw a bowl of broccoli florets at me and I ducked, falling facefirst into the french dressing.
- Then the woman attacked me, force-feeding me jalapeno peppers and stuffing black olives in my ears while her husband put a cold pewter plate down my pants.
- So, what was the soup of the day? I've won a cruise?!
- All expenses paid?!
- A one-way ticket to Ninny Island? You could be among your own! Meow! What?
- Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow!
- Odie, with that thick dog accent, I can't understand a word you're saying. Jon's putting up some new blinds.
- Wanna know how I'm doing?
- SHOONK No. If Jon's socks are in this drink...
- Where is the ice?
- My feet are cold. Duh! I know why you won't go out with me, Ellen.
- It's because I don't drive a big, fancy car!
- OK...and I'm boring. Are you going to take the car back? You know, Garfield.
- Some people enjoy dressing their pets up in funny outfits.
- Believe me. You wouldn't enjoy it. Here, put these on!
- Who cares if I can't get a date?!
- We're wearing party hats!!
- And we're having a good time!
- The whole NEIGHBORHOOD is gonna have a good time!
- Everybody! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hubert, I'm very afraid. Shut up and conga. Hey, chicky boo, chicky boo, boo, boo!
- Here, chicky, chicky, chicky!
- Yo, chick-o, chick-o, chick-o-rama. And he's available, ladies! Remember me? Uh...
- We went on a date once. We did?
- I ran screaming from the room. You'll havr to be more specific. Hey look, a clown!
- Don't you agree that it's rude to comment on the attire of others?
- Make me laugh, clown boy. YOur seltzer bottle, clown boy. Garfield, that girl is smiling at me! The one picking lettuce out of her teeth?
- Time to turn on the cool.
- Whoa, didn't even stay to pay the check.
- Chicks dig me.
- Boy, this is uncomfortable. Let's see you walk. We have a new member with us tonight.
- My name is Jon Arbuckle.
- And I'm wearing a bad suit. We see your pain. DING-DONG **
- Whay, thank you so much!
- slam!
- Look, Garfield! Mrs. Feeny brought us a cake!
- She made it herself...wasn't that thoughtful of
-
- POP
- You destroyed her daisies again, didn't you? I also maimed her marigolds and mauled her mums. Death, taxes.
- and teddy bears.
- Three things you can always count on!
-
- Give me the dog whistle. What dog whistle? Garfield, I'm depressed.
- I could use a hug.
- I could use a Lamborghini but you don't hear me whining. Cat hair!
- My entire world is covered with cat hair!
- Except my toothbrush. Ah! THERE'S my ear groomer! Actually, Betty, I am deep.
- In fact, lately I've been contemplating my mortality.
- I'm donating my brain to science. That shouldn't take up too much space on the ol' shelf. You know, Jon...
- Life is filled with myteries.
- I wish you hadn't taken the labels off all our canned food. Many myteries indeed. I'm hungry.
- I wish I had a big ham.
- POOF!
- Wow! I wish Jon was here to see this!
- Yes? This has got to be a dream...
- I wish it wasn't, though. POOF
- Real bright, Garfield. Cats eat mice.
- Theyplay catch 'em. They play with 'em...
- AND THEY EAT EM! Not enough catsup in the world, pal. ...and that's my pet cat.
-
- I have a name, you know! Food!
- GOTCHA! LUNCH TIME!
- In front of the TV, or out on the patio? TV! Garfield, these mice are out of hand!
- Get tough with them! Understand?! Okay.
- The ballet is off! Awwww... See, Garfield, you are the hunter...the mouse is the prey.
- Now what does the hunter do?
- Dork Boy
-
- Servant's entrance. I knew that.

- You're not a spider... Very perceptive, brick brain.
- For your information, I happen to be a centipede...
- A flat arthropod of the class chilopoda, with numerous body segments and legs.
- Now you can write in your diary that you actually learned something new today, you oaf!
- Dear diary... We've sure had some good times, haven'T we, Garfield?
-
- WELL?! Is this one of them?
-
- Check it out, Garfield.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his suit.
- And his cologne. You're a clown who works in a fish market? ""Dear diary: I am bored.""
-
- ""The pets, on the other hand..."" Ellen, this is Jon.
- EEEEK! CLICK
- She must have had an accident! Self-inflicted, no doubt. Don't let me keep you from whatever you were doing, Jon!
-
- Or to put it another way, get lost!
- Okay, Odie...
- This time we go for the world's record. Urf.
- One...two...thre...go!
-
- SLURP!
- YAAAAAAHHHHH I enjoyed a brisk three-mile run before breakfast.
- So, what did YOU do?
- Burp *I* enjoyed your breakfast. New book, Garfield.
- It's called ""Normal Pets"".
- You're not listed. I shun publicity. If you gain any more weight, you won't be able to move!
- Wow.
- A fringe benefit. Breathing?
-
- Just checking. Appreciate it. Lions are in the cat family.
- Lions are great hunters.
- YOU are a disgrace. Careful, I just slaughtered a herd of pickles. You could use some ambition.
-
- Does that come with fries? Jon! Look!
- Look, Jon, look!
- Look! Look! Look!
- Jon! Jon! Jon! Jon!
- Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! Look!
- ALL RIGHT! WHAT IS IT?!!
- Made you look. We'd like to order a pizza.
- That's right. With everything that might conceivably be edible.
- They knew it was for you. I'm so proud. Z
-
- Pizza delivery truck? Three houses down...pepperoni! HONK! HONK!
- Bring the pizza to the door! I'm not getting out of my truck!
- Your cat's nuts! Hey, I'm a touchy, feely kinda guy. You the guy who ordered thew extra-extra-extra large pizza? Yes.
-
- Looks like we're gonna have to take out a wall. Heaven... * I'm in heaven. * Yuk! What?
- There's cat hair on my pizza! Hey, no big deal.
- And it doesn't appear to be yours. POO! POO! I wish I could be liked and admired.
- Or that I had a large sausage pizza.
- Of course, if I had a large sausage pizza, I wouldn't need to be liked and admired. boing boing
- Good day, sir. My name is Frank Flea and I'm a recent college graduate in search of an entry-level parasite position.
- I assure you'd find me a dedicated employee, a hard worker, and a team player!
- I may be new to this field, but I come from a long line of successful blood suckers and feel prepared to carry on that fine tradition!
- Sounds impressive, Frank, but I'm currently not accepting applications.
- Try the dog in the next room. I believe his right hindquarter has an opening. Really?!
- What is that? A tiny resume.
- YEOWWW!
- Sometimes you just have to bite something. Odie chased his tail.
- Odie caught his tail. Odie buried his tail. Let's play ""Find the Donut!""
-
- Some days I hate you. All right, I'll give you a hint. Will you stop staring at my food?!
-
- STOP IT! Not even a forlorn glance? My name is Stephano. I am very rich and macho. tick tick tick
- Anyone want to chat? tick tick tick
- Whoa... Nobody can empty a chat room like Stephano. I have places to go and things to do!
- I have no place to go and nothing to do.
- I'm running late! I'm right on schedule. Who? Me?!
- Who?......me?
- Who? ME?!
- WHO?! Meeeee?
- Whooo? Me? Who? Meeeee?! Who?! Me?!
- He what?

- Yes, I'm aware of how many daysit is till Christmas. Well, let's get cracking! Pooky, Christmas is coming!
-
- He's containing his excitement. Christmas is just around the corner, Odie!
-
- Look, a Christmas card from Doc Boy!
- ""Happy holidays to my chicken-ticklin', cow-tippin', rooster-rasslin', city boy brother"".
- How sweet of him to remember all that! You can take the dork aout of the farn, but you can't take the farm out of the dork. ""Dear son, happy holidays from the farm. So much has been happening here...""
- ""The mare had a foal, the sow had a litter, and the chicken had a stroke...""
- ""...she was sure tasty, though"". I'm starting to enjoy these letters from home. May I borrow three marshmallows? Sure.
-
- GARFIELD! Okay, here we go...
- Dear Santa, I am writing this letter for my cat, Garfield, who has been an okay cat most of the year.
- SLAP!
- Delete Delete Delete Delete
- ...good all year. SLAP!
- Delete Delete Delete Delete tick tick tic tikka tikka tic
- A SAINT!!! Oh, PLEASE. It necer hurts to pad your resume. Santa Claus isn't stupid, you know!
- I'd think twice before sending him that letter about how good you were this year!
- Maybe I should take out that part about winning the nobel peace prize. Really?! Can I shake your hand? The All-Cat Channel now returns to:
- ""Snowball, the Cat Who Slept Through Christmas"".
- What's on? Z
- Some movie based on a true story. No exact change? ...awww, go on through!
- On donner! On blitzen!
- We will return to ""Melvin Weederpate, the Toll Booth Guy who Saved Christmas"". This is getting out of hand. We now return to ""Murray, the Snake who Saved Christmas"". Sssay, Sssanta, how about me guiding the sleight tonight?
- STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- Uh...we will return to...uh...""Cybil, the Chipmunk who Saved Murray"" in a minute. I wonder who'll save Cybil? Hi, Grandma? It's Jon, calling to wish you happy holidays!
- Grandma? GANDMA?! CAN YOU HEAR M-... O.K., I'LL WAIT!!
- Turning her hearing aid? Turning down the heavy metal CD on her stereo. I love the holidays.
- And I found the cutest Christmas decorations!
- Now, go stand on on the roof. Guess who's getting a rat in his stocking this year?
-
- Oh, no...forget that!
- You ain't kissin' ME under the mistletoe, pal!
- SLUUURRRP!
-
- Okay! OKay! We'll go buy a Christmas tree! Time me!
- UNNGH! THUMP! OW! GAAH! DONK! WONK! NYAAHH! CRUNCH DOINK! TWIST
- The tree is up! Six hours, thirty-two minutes and sventeen seconds...a new record! Hello, tree!
- Long time, no see!
- Hugging th tree again? You're just jealous. O.K., the lights are up, the tree is up, the cards have been mailed, and the presents are wrapped.
- Let's see...what else needs to be don

- hOW'd
- ...you like to go...
- OUtwith me
- new yEARs EEEve?
- Stop pinching me!! That was fun! Call someone else. I don't know, Garfield...
- I still say someone switched the gift tags. Nonsense.
- That flea collar is for you. Hi, Lisa, it's Jon Arbuckle...
- I have two tickets to the polka joe concert at the Bowl-O-Rama for this new year's eve. Care to join me?
- I just learned three new words. Unsuitable for a comic strip, no doubt. No, no, I understand completely, Patti.
- Some other new year's eve, perhaps.
- She hat to stay home to floss her otter. Trusting soul, or blooming idiot? You make the call. Beth, sweetie, how'd you like to go out with the one and only MEEE on new year's eve?
-
- Ever laugh so hard you choke? Oh, I've hacked up a hairball or two... Testing: one...two...
- BLAAT!
- New year's eve sound check. Come closer... A toast: to the new year!
- clink
- This does not bode well... It's not a very good sign, either.
-
-
-
-
-
- Happy new year. Not so louuud. Garfield, let's just sit here and think deep thoughts.
-
- Do monkeys marry? Come back! You're too deep! I take no pleasure in kicking Odie.
- BOOT!
- I do, however, enjoy watching him claw at the air on the way down. Getting a little plump, aren't we? Plump?
- Plump, you say?
- Put it back. Plump is history. Garfield, I just had a thought!
-
- Darn! Slippery little devils. Ellen siad not to call her anymore.
- She says it's too expensive.
- She says every time I call she rips the phone out the wall. Badda boom. I have a lot of things on my schedule.
- Whoa.
- All I have on mine is a little ketchup. Uh-oh.
- Ahh! A nutritious snack!
- Please spare me, Mr. Cat! I've got a wife and six kids!
-
-
- Who...uh...are away visiting my mother for an indefinite period of time?...
- Fish who live in glass houses shouldn't fib. What are you doing today, Garfield?
- I thought I'd finish my memoirs, and then paint the house.
- I sense sarcasm. ...and then it's on to community service.
- All I ask is that you move enough so I don't have to dust you.
- Work! Work! Work! Z
- Z
- Z His daisy-stomping dream. I had a busy day.
- Me too.
- Mine was about eight years ago. Cats in the jungle must hunt for every meal.
- I used to do that...
- Before we put the pizza place on the speed dial. You know, some cats jump up and romp about the house for no reason at all.
-
- So... Not in our lifetime.
- RIIING! *
- Hello?
- Yes?.....YES?....
- YES?!
- yeeeeesssssss?...
- I /sincerely/ apologize... That's my cue to hide behind the drapes for an hour. Wouldn't you like to have a cat like me around your house?
-
- You do have a cookie jar, don't you? And the winner of the ""Bird of the Year"" award is...
- Stan the sparrow!
- I'll be accepting on Stan's (burp) behalf. Odie, I want you to go far away.
- Far, far away.
- One more ""far"" there, pal... Here's a picture of my grandfather's elbow.
-
- I see the resemblance. Why won't you go out with me, Cindy?
- You're getting a root canal?
- Mind if I tag along? Won't she be suffering enough? I feel like having some fun!
-
- The feeling is starting to fade. Maybe you're having fun and don't know it. click
- Cats of the world, unite!
- It's time to burn our collars and throw off the yoke of oppression!
- We have suffered under the heel of the humans for far too long!
- The time to act has arrived! The time to
- Oh, Flu-ffy! *
- Uh...the time to... Flu-ffy! Dinner!
- Uh, hang on-I'll be back in a minute. The revolution is recessed for num-nums. Sigh...another day of toil.
- No sense lying around. Better get busy.
- These cartoons won't watch themselves. Today's program is brought to you by a product we couldn't care less about.
- We're being cancelled at the end of the season, so it hardly matters anyway...
- Hey, Petey Everett from third grade...BITE me!
- Too bad it's ending...it's getting better. Woof! Woof!
- Woof!...Uh...
- Line? ""Woof,"" you idiot! In his defense, it WAS a long speech. And now the farm report.
- Dan, little Nancy Slobo was bitten by a cow today.
- The incident occured during a game of ""Slap the Udder"". Cows hate that. We at channel 31 are dedicated to quality programming.
- Informative, educational and responsible, that's us!
- We now return to ""World's Ugliest People"". Look at that nose! Doctor, what is the difference between cats and dogs?
- Well, dogs have a high degree of loyalty.
- Where as a cat would turn in its own mother. Only if there's a reward.
- Garfield! Mail's here!
- It arrived! It arrived!
-
- Hey, Garfield! Notice anything different about me?
-
- New cologne? Friends may come and friends may go...
- But a teddy bear is forever.
- poit! Where are my sweat pants?
-
- I don't even want to know where my tee shirt is. Then don't look behind you. I'm going to frolic ion the meadow!
-
- They built a hotel on it. You could hang out in the lobby. That was Mrs. Brown on the phone.
- She says you bit her.
- Well?! She was wearing a mumu with pork chops printed all over it. Florence, remember when you said I was no fun?
- Well, you'll have to change your tune!
- ""1001 Elephant Jokes,"" baby! Run, Florence, run! Remember the good times we've had, Garfield?
-
- Remember the mediocre times we've had, Garfield? Yeah... ...so I said, ""it's gotta be brie, baby, or nothing at all...""
- Uh-oh...here comes your human...hide me!
- STUFF!
- On guard, I see.
- Keep up the good work! SLAP! GULP
- Mouse! Are you still there?! Barely.
- I have a death grip on your uvula Mrs. Feeny's dog is on our lawn. I know.
- Looks like he's laughing. I hate him.
- What is he waving about? That was a perfectly good tail. BEWARE OF THE DOG!!
-
- Spent all their money on advertising. Dogs are brave.
- And you smell funny when you're wet!
- Cats are sarcastic. Beware Of The Scary Dog grrr That's not scary.
-
- booo! Maybe a little annoying... That's a great sign! Beware Of The Dog Why, thank you.
- It really suits you! Aw, gwan!
- I think I forgot something. Beware of the dog! How come?
- Um...
- Because the people who make those signs have families to feed? sigh pat pat

- GARFIELD! Okay, Garfield, it was fun for a while...
- But now it's gotten out of control.
- This has to stop. Ellen, this is Jon.
- No! Don't hang up! I just want you to ask you for dinner!
- Yes, NOW you can hang up. Ahem... I'M available. I worked hard today.

-
- Hey!
- I have a right to singl the blues!
- I also have the right to eat the pepperoni off of everyone else's pizza.
- Yip! Yip! What is it, boy?
- Jon! Little Timmy has fallen down the old well!
- And, as it turns out, he LOVES it down there!
- He has a TV and a VCR, and he's away from his evil foster parents...
- So PLEASE don't rescue him!
- This is one of the days I'm glad I don't speak ""cat"".
-
- How to Annoy How NOT to be Annoyed You better not mess with us, Jon! Right, Odie?
-
- See? He agrees with me. I'm using a new shampoo.
-
- As what? Good morning, Garfield. Go away!
- Special day today! I said, ""go away"".
- It's ""Check your-pet-for-parasites day""! I know a lawyer! It's friday night, Garfield.
- Another weekend of TV and junk food...
- Falling asleep during some mindless movie... Yesss! YAWN
- For those of you who came in late, here's what you missed.
- YAWN
- Dinner!
- Soup?
- Soup?!
- SOUP?!!
- It's cream of lasagna.
- Souuuuuuuup. skitter skitter skitter . STOMP!
- What's the point of having all these legs if I can't outrun anybody? Dwayne, look at you! What happened?!
- SMACK
- That. I have 342 kids...all teenagers.
- WHACK!
- Thank you. Any time.
- A hobo spider...now I've seen everything. Buddy, can you spare a fly? Now I've HEARD everything, too. My, my, my, that's a big hammer.
- You must be a construction worker.
- Salt of the earth, that's what. Now for the ironic twist.
-
- Funny, I don't remember swatting a spider.
- I'll see you then!
- I have a date every night this week!
- Because the women, they love me!
-
-
- They say everyone in the world has a double somewhere. Jon!
- Well, I have something to do. Go ahead.
- I think I can handle this by myself. ""...and while the dog slept, the cat sat at the whetstone sharpening his claws.""
- ""Tonight would be an eventful night indeed..."" To be continued...
- Staring at me doesn't bother me at all.
-
- SO STOP IT! Here's a good cause, Garfield.
- I might look into this. All right!
- It's an endangered species list. Oh, it's not a menu? I have a date, and the only thing clean is my gorilla suit.
-
- YEAAAAH! He never fails to disappoint me. I hate to admit it, but I miss Jon.
- I miss the laughter...the kindness...
- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!Maybe I should let him out the closet.
- SLAM!
- What a day!
- I was downtown and saw a place to get your palm read, so I went in.
- This old gypsy woman took one look at my palm and couldn't stop laughing! Naturally, this upset me...
- So I took out my gum and stuck it on her crystal ball. And that's when she got mad and put this curse on me.
- Sooo, what's the curse? Here you go, hot from the grill!
-
- My omelette has feathers. Swap you for the one with a beak. Two tuna specials, please.
- Sob! ...sorry, I get emotional.
- My first husband passed away while eating the tuna special. Cheese! I'll have a grilled cheese! This cheeseburger is delicious, Irma!
- What's your secret? We let our cheese age, hon.
- Been sitting in my pickup for almost six months now. Spit take on three... How's my lobster dinner coming?
- *SNAP* *SNAP* YAAHH!
- BY DOES! IT'S GOT BY DOSE! It'll be right up. ...with one interesting garnish. Would you care for an after-dinner coffee drink?
- Sure! What have you got?
- Well, there's your regular and your decaf. You've gotta love your diner. Nothing going on over there.
- Nothing going on over there.
- This must be where the action is. I'm terribly sorry...
- That was Mrs. Feeny complaining about you again.
- You are NOT to set foot on her property again, understand?!
-
- * RING
-
- GET YOUR *TOE* OFF HER LAWN!! I could use some cheering up.
- No way, Jose.
- I'm not leaving.
- You're a lazy bum, Odie!
- I like to give him a little praise when he deserves it. Harold, I'm afraid! Fear not, Harriet. I shall defend you to the end!
- GULP
- Well, my job is done. I'm thinking of a number between one and ten.
-
- pat pat pat Good for you. I have a date tonight!
- I wonder what I should give her?
- How about a head start? Another day has gone by.
- Why shouldn't it?
- We sure did nothing to stop it. click

- ...and now we'll pait a happy little deer by our little brook... click
- ...burn fat! Add muscle! click
- ...just rub on and watch those wrinkles melt away! click
- ...it slices! It dices!
- Where were you? Oh, just dabbling, doodling, pumping, primping, slicing, dicing... You ate one of my goldfish!
- Now this one will be sad and lonely!
- Just sad. GARFIELD! Hey, hey.
- You know, it's bad luck to eat a goldfish!
- So, I'll stay out of the casinos. Garfield! You ate my goldfish! Did not!
- Did too! Did not!
- Did too! Have you no shame?
- Shame...shame...
- Nope. Garfield, have you met my new goldfish? Why yes, I...
- !
- PTOO clonk Full moon tonight.
- That's when I turn into a primal beast.
- I see I'm not alone.
- Go ahead. Stick your hand in here. Wow!
- Look at that pretty girl in the water, Garfield! I'll get her attention!
- SHARK!
- YAAAHHH! EEEEK! YAAA!
- Look...here she comes!
- SLAP! How dare you panic all those people!
- Well, it can't get any worse than this. You called? Boy, this is taking forever.
- tap tap
- Stop signs don't turn green, you dip. I'm hungry.
- What are you doing in the glove compartment, Garfield? Looking for a snack.
- Care to join me? We have ketchup, mustard, relish, salt and soy sauce. Jon cleaned his windshield this morning, and guess what that means...
- SPLAP
- You got it. YAAAH! Two Happy Burgers. You don't sound happy.
- I said, two Happy Burgers, pal!
- Well, maybe you'll like a Grumpy Burger.
- HAPPY BURGERS! Would you like some rude fries with that? I'm expecting an important call.
-
- Even a WRONG NUMBER could be important! I'll leave you alone with your fantasies. Garfield, there's a rat out there!
- It's big enought to eat a dog!
- So, do something! * Heere, Odie!

- * RIING HELLO!
- Well? I'm taking mom to Bingo saturday. Garfield, don't mess with my new plant.
- It's very expensive.
- And exotic. And friendy.
-
- SMACK!
-
- SMACK!
- Garfield, what are you doing? I'm practicing being exasperated.
- I'm videotaping my sock drawer! SMACK! This was my great uncle Norbert.
- He was a color-blind electrician.
- He had more trouble with those read and black wires. Interesting hair style. There's my great uncle Floyd. He drove a dynamite truck.
- And there he is again...
- and there, and there, and there... This is a picture of ""Scraps,"" our neighbor's dog on the farm.
- Boy, he loved to play fetch.
- Then, one day he chased a stick right into a thresher. At least he lived up to his name. ...and here's good old uncle Buford, a lifelong bachelor.
- I never could figure out why.
- Maybe it was that third arm... Couldn't exactly shop off of the rack, could he? ...and there's cousin leonard.
- He believed he'd been kidnapped by aliens.
- The aliens, of course, denied the whole thing.
- Okay, NOW I'm frigthened. Are you frigthened? There's old uncle Enos...
- He was the state champion apple corer.
- He had three medals. And six fingers too, I see.
-
- Mister big shot!
- Not so high and mighty without your newspaper, are you?!
- Well, now the advantage is MINE! Ha ha ha ha ha!!

- Am I wearing loafers? I taught Odie a new trick!
- Who broke this vase?!
- Take the rap, Odie! Take the rap! Thanks, doctor.
- GARFIELD, THAT WAS THE VET'S OFFICE!
- YOU HAVE A FUNGUS! Great! Say it a little louder, why don't you?! No one has ever regretted going out with me, Gina.
- Well, maybe they got a little upset.
- All right! They changed their names and moved! But no regrets. Always stretch before you exercise.
- Got it.
- Never stretch.
- Nobody understands me!
- Not you!
- And not you!
- Oh, maybe my sock puppet understands me a LITTLE...
- But not YOU guys!
- And that's a good thing, right, Odie? Jon's doing a little home improvement today. * TWANG

- Stick a stamp on my head and mail me to Loserville! This is cold. Look, a card from Dr. Liz, the vet...it's time for your checkup!
- Oh, boy! Maybe she'll find something WRONG with you!
- Then we can go back to see her again and again! Can you just feel the love in the room? Wanna go for a little ride in the car, Garfield? Uh-ho.
- That question can only mean one of two things. The lady vet or the farm.
- Just let me splash a little more cologne and we'll go. It's the vet. OK, Garfield, we're at the vet's. Now behave yourself.
- And remember, the fish tank in the waiting room is NOT a buffet.
- That means the bib, lemon wedge and drawn butter stay in the car. You are no Mr. Fun, you know that? Garfield is here for his checkup.
-
- Species? Cat. And you, lady? I hate waiting rooms.
- I hate the stupid pamphlets they put in the waiting rooms.
- Look, Garfield, an ingrown nose hair! Can I get a painkiller over here? I hate the vet's office.
- They should at least serve coffee.
- And have a separate waiting room for dogs. I'm gonna get a shot! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

- Sigh... Sigh...
- Hee hee I heard that. So what would you like for your birthday this year?
-
- That has got to be the mother of all can openers. Three-fifty, dual-cam, fuel-injected five-speed! So you're going to be 22, huh? That's right.
-
- Want to reminisce about your gallbladder or something? Getting older isn't so bad, Garfield... Oh, no?
- Why, I remember when *I* turned 22...
- Wait a minute...no, I don't. SEE?!! I glued the top onto Garfield's birthday present so he can't peek.
- That should keep him thinking all weekend.

- Hello? Hel-LO!
- Well? My car payment is late. Nice dinner, nice movie...

- Halfway to the front porch, she sucker punched me and ran. Did this one take your wallet too?
- I had the vet take Garfield's temeprature.
- Let's talk health here. Let's talk dignity here. !
- Garfield!
- When I left this room, there was a hamburger on this plate.
- When I returned, all that was left was this pickle chip.
- Now, I have my suspicions, but I don't want to jump to any hasty conclusions.
- So tell me...what should I do?
- You could leave the room again so I could take care of that pickle chip. So, doc, how have you been? Fine.
- And how is your boyfriend? I don't have a boy
-
- ...friend. Lady, you have no one to blame but yourself. Enough of my macho posturing, Liz...may I have the pleasure of escorting you to a movie?

- How am I supposed to see the movie? I could nibble some eye holes for you. Are you sure you're going to get away with this, Jon?
- Oh, yeah...we go to the movies here all the time.
- Two, please. Hey, Morty! The freak with the tail is back! So, Jon, what movie are we seeing?

- SLAM! Hello? S'matter, hon? Unlucky at love? You can tell?
- Yeah, you have that look. What look is that?
- You look like you're having coffee in a siut with your cat in a diner on a saturday night. The woman is psychic.

- What if the whole world were like you?

- I burrow under the ground and eat dirt. What do you do for fun?
- I like to boogie down on the sidewalk after a good rain. Do you like being a worm?
- Do cats eat worms? No.

- We had some wild times.
- At night we'd sneak out to the barn and drink unpasteurized milk! Another piece of the puzzle! I'm not a countryboy anymore, mom.
- I even buy eggs at a store.
- Don't cry, ma! You could have broken it to her more gently. I remember summer nights on the farm...
- A gentle breeze wafting through the meadow...
- Chasing each other with cattle prods... There was something in the water. Here's a great picture from the farm.
- It was taken the day we got indoor plumbing.
- The entire family gathered around the toilet. You mom looks so proud cutting that ribbon. I wasn't a popular child, Garfield. Go figure.

- And we all love you! Merry Christmas! So long, Christmas! Good-bye!
-
- Don't be a stranger! Hi, Denise, it's Jon! Are you doing anything for New Years's?
-
- I mean BESIDES avoiding me at all costs. Zing! Nobody will go out with me on new year's.
- Don't feel bad, Jon.
- They wouldn't go out with you even if it weren't new year's. pat pat pat pat WHY can't I get a date?!
- What am I? Ugly?...No! What am I? Impolite?...No! What a I? Boring?...
- Z OH, SHUT UP! Dating is overrated.
- New year's overrated.
- Dates on new year's, however, are not. WAAAH!
- Ten...nine...
- eight...seven...
- six...five...
- four...three...
- two...ONE...
- Garfield, it's seven in the morning... Practice makes perfect! HAPPY NEW YEAR! Here's your mail.
- And here's the mailman's wallet.
- Leave the poor man alone! Boy, are his kids ugly. What do you want to do?
- OKay.
- Home is where you can walk around in your underwear.
- Home is where you can drink milk out of the carton.
- Home is where you can scratch where it itches. I met a reporter yesterday, Garfield.
- She was looking for a human-interest story.
- She took my picture! ""Park Attracts Geeks"" Friday night...
- And I'm home with a cat!
- Could anyone be more depressed? My life stinks, Garfield...like a wet dog.
- Like old sweat socks...
- Like... I GET THE POINT!
- donk! Donk? Donk?
- donk donk donk donk donk Wow! Look at that!
- donk donk donk donk Golf ball-sized hail!
- donk donk donk donk donk -He really should seek professional help. donk thwock I didn't buy any kitty treats, Garfield, and you know why?
- Because life is not a treat, that's why.
- Rmeember that as I pull out a neck hair. I have things to do!
- I have places to go!
- So, that's what having a life feels like. Never hurts to practice. Time to reflect on the day...
- YAAAAAHHH!!
- Why do you do that to yourself? Odie...a water balloon...
- A claw...
- That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped. ""The crew of the doomed ship had lost hope.""
- ""Provisions gone...no one had eaten in days...""
- ""The ship's cat appeared on the deck..."" Bedtime! We had a cat back on the farm, Garfield.
- He was a great ratter. The bigger the better!
- You would have liked him. I don't hang with psychos. Yes?...
- You WILL go out with me?!...if I what?...
-
- cluck-cluck-buck.buc-buc-buc-kaww...
- Am I what?
-
- Yes, I'm flapping my arms. Heaven forbid he should embarrass himself in front of the cat. Quiet on the set!
- ACTION!
- Nice try. All is right in my universe.
- Stringmaaaan!
- Gotta get a smaller universe. I have many hopes and dreams for the future.
- I have a salami sandwich!
- How about dreaming up some iced tea?
-
- Been eating those fruit-shaped refrigerator magnets again? Maybe. BAT
- BAT BAT BAT BAT BAT BAT
- My parents wanted me to be a sweater, but noooooo... Empires raise and fall.
- SE?!
- WHY RISE?! bip bip boop beep boop
- Hello, is Evelyn there?
- What's that? She doesn't live there anymore?
- She's hopped a freighter for Borneo?
- She's forsworn all her material possessions and modern ways of living?
- Wow.
- She didn't mention that on our date last night. You do have that effect on women. Today wasn't a good day.
- But I guess it wasn't a bad day either.
- So you're saying it wasn't a day at all. I'm not going to shed anymore.
- I've contracted the job out.
- Out there are all of nature's wonders!
- In here are corn chips and dip.
- I want it all! Crime, taxes, war, strife...
- Natural disasters, economic ruin...
- Sigh... There sure is a lot of shedding in this world.
- Make a note, Garfield.
- Never eat a goldfish right before bedtime. You!
- Remember this!
- It's not polite to point!
-
-
-
-
-
- FOOMP
- Good movie on tonight, Garfield.
- Herbie the Chipmunk in...
- ""Attack of the Tiny Herbivores"". I guess all the scary animals have been used up. ""Moby Dick"".
- Big whale...obsessed sea captain...chase...fight...Ahab buys the farm, Moby swims into sunset. The End.
- Tune in again for ""Ten-Second Stories"". Next week they're doing ""War and Peace"". Today on ""Everybody Corner,"" my lovely assistant and I will be demonstrating correct plucking techniques.
- poink! OW!
- JERK! pssst! PEPPER SPRAY! GAAHH! SECURITY! I love TV. Here's Earl with the early-morning farm report.
- Van, there's nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see.
- Earl, any tractor sightings? City boys. We're visiting Rex the Stunt Dog.
- Rex, what do you get paid for all those dangerous stunts?
- Well, they pat me on the head a lot. The dumb work cheap. The remote is broken. click click
- And I'm watching ""The History of Norwegian Flowerpots"".
- Lethargy certainly expands your horizons. Greetings.
- Every animal has a special place...
- We cats favor windowsills.
- The luxury of lying in the warm sunlight...
- The panoramic view of the world...the passing parade of humanity.
-
- We cats favor the floor... Hello, mom.
- Oh, thr same old thing.
- Right now I'm dusting the cat. Hee hee hee Garfield, I hear something in the basement!
- It could be a HUGE rat!
- Doesn't that inflame your primal instincts? Yes, I'll be in the car. Reserved
- Reserved
- Is it possible that I've lost the element of surprise? Odie dug up the flowers in the garden!
- Oops
- Odie dug up the flowers in the garden! Congratulations, you have won the gran dprize!
- An evening with me.
- The excitement was too much. Probably a stomach virus. Nobody can stretch like a cat.
- YAWN
- Hey!
- I'm pretty much sick of winter.
- ENOUGH WITH tHE SNOW ALREADY!
-
-
-
- zip I have a simple philosophy, Garfield.
- Laugh and the world laughs with you.
- In fact, I can hear them now. They camp on the lawn. POOF!
- I am the Genie of the Cookie Jar!
- You have three wishes! Where's a cookie when you need one? I'm not doing anything today, Garfield. Atta boy.
- I'm being lazy. My hero.
- I'm not even changing your litter boy. Psycho! Jon, let's savor this moment. I have a banana in my ear.
- Someday we'll remember when you tripped over me coming back from the grocery...and laugh! There are grapes in my nose.
- These are the good old days! I'm going to kill you. Enjoy your dinner, Garfield? Very tasty.
- I call it ""Back-of-the-fridge-bottom-shelf-behind-the-baking-soda stew"".
- I can only make it about once every five years. That's just a little bit more than I needed to know. I'm bored, tired and hungry.
-
- Yeah, but can you shed? Huh? Huh?
- *
- *
- Pooky! You're WARM! You've been hugged recently, and NOT by me!
- Have you been hugging around?!
- I just got your bear out of the dryer.
- I'm such a jealous fool! Chicks dig the tough-guy look.
- So I got this leather jacket. What think, Garfield?
- It goes well with your bunny slippers. I'm not your type?!
- Well just wht is your type?
- Human? Picky, picky, picky. Cindy just called.
- PLPLPLPLPLPL!!
- She said I was immature. What does she know? Would you repeat thet?
- You WILL go out with me?!
- Hello?...Hello? Jon will be right back. He's in the front yard doing his happy chicken dance. Yes! Yes! Oh, yes! I have a date with Ginny tonight.
- She loves to laugh.
- I have three hours to get a sense of humor. I'll ge tthe fake forehead faucet. Some kids have been ringing our doorbell and running.
- This bucket of water will teach them a lesson! DING DONG
- My date will be here any second. I don't think so.

- It has a nice melody, but you can't dance to it.
- Hungry cats have no sense of humor. There are two reasons why I hate spiders.
- They're sneaky... SPLAT!
- And I suspect they're stealing food. CLANK DONK I'm the avenging spider!
- kick
- scratch scratch I strike again! Go away.
- Aha! Is it my violent nature and ruthless heritage that threatens you?...
- Or is it my imposing, hairy body and long venomous fangs? It's your fly breath. And now go away. SMACK!
-
- You're late. Sorry. I don't have time to stop!
- SMACK!
- You must learn to relax. How's this? SPIDER! Wait!
- Spiders eat insects!
- INSECT EATER! SMACK!
-
- WHACK!
-
-
- ?
- Wheeeeeeeeee!! BLAT! SLORP! SLURP! SLUP! SLURP!
- Please, Garfield, thare's nothing more disgusting than that! SLORP! SLUP!
- Except that. Garfield, help! I locked myself out getting the paper!
- Hurry! I don't have any pants on!
- I'm wearing the puppy underwear!
- Then come in through the pet door.
-
- Tomorrow, I'm going back to getting dressed AFTER I take my shower! Well, at least you tried something. RRRrrrrrrr
- Garfield, was that the blender?
- Forget it, I don't want to know. Bunny-slipper frappe? I know how to get a woman's attraction.
- WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOME BARNYARD IMITATIONS?!
- Well, that got her attention. I didn't know anyone could run that fast in heels. Heh, heh, heh...
- Oh, the trouble I could cause!
- If my claws weren't stuck in the table. SLUP
- My coffee's cold.
- Boy, I hate cold coffee. Hate it, hate it, hate it.
- Nopem there's nothing worse in the world than cold coffee. slap slap slap
- I'll bet if I tried as hard as I could, I couldn't possibly think of anything worse than cold coffee. twitch twitch
- EEEEYAAAAAAHHH!!!
- Okay...soggy shorts, -maybe. C'mon, Garfield...up an' at 'em!
- LIFE is calling!
- Tell life to leave a message. ...it's not like I haven't done anything with my life...
- Oh, wait a minute...
- Yes, it is! You apologize to Odie for what you did to him, or I'll punish you severely!
-
- Punish me severely. Wanna hear about my day?
-
- NO I'm not paying for this card! There are many, many things I will never understand.
-
- And they're all women. A rare moment of honesty. This is ""NAtional Ugly Fish Week"".
- So eat an ugly fish today...
- And leave the planet that much less ugly. Slogan needs work.
-
-
-
-
-
- Enjoy the little thingsand the big things will take care of themselves. Ma, can I ask you something? Of course, Timmy.
- Can I have a pet? A pet?
- He followed me home, ma. You're not very bright, are you, Timmy?
- Watch out for the spider!
- Some lookout you are. Sorry. You'd better not mess with me! Know why?
- SMACK!
- Because you're so tough? And don't you forget it. ...and with a kiss from the beautiful princess...
- The frog turned into a handsome spider...
- Which the princess stomped flat! Hey! Hey! Stick to the story! Hey, cat, I'm gonna hop on your neck and suck out all your bodily fluids.
- WHACK!
- Hey! You crimped my sraw! This is my college intern.
- SMACK!
- He does good work. *I* think so.
- I'll be shaving, in case anyone calls for me.
-
- buzzzzzzzzzzzzz
- buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
- click
- Just checking...did anyone call? The paranoia police send their regards. Life stinks.
- You should have a more positive attitude.
- Life stinks. I'm thinking about writing the story of my life.
-
- Maybe I should actually do something first. That would really help with the title. Remember that day at the amusement park, Garfield? How can I forget?
- They sure had some scary rides. Embarrassing...
- I couldn't stop screaming. But in the parking lot, Jon? When communicating with pets...
- Keep commands simple and to the point.
- Lose...some...weight. Get...a...life. Maybe I'll get together with friends tonight.
- We'll laugh and engage in stimulating conversation...
- Or maybe I'll stay home and floff. Reality sets in. Do you know what's wrong with cats?
- They... CLICK
- Hey! You watch too much television. Sigh
- We should do something.
- How about mailing Mrs. Feeny's little dog to an obscure overseas nation with insufficient postage?
- Or we could thumb wrestle for that last piece of cheesecake.
- Or we could hijack an ice cream truck and hold the driver hostage for the world's largest nutty-buddy.
- Or we could paint oursevles purple, sit in the bathtub too long, and pretend we're raisins.
- Checkers? I'm red this time. Garfield, three mice just walked through the front door.
- Havan't you heard?
- They were carrying suitcases! The cheese expo is in town. Hmmm...what should I do about this new mousehole?
- Of course!
- Accept a bribe! Garfield, this is a diagram of the food chain.
- You're here, and that's a mouse down there...
- Any questions? Where's pizza?
- Woof
- Uh...Garfield?... Yey, I know. They're making dogs smaller these days, aren't they? SNAP! OUCH!
- SNAP! OUCH!
- SNAP! OUCH!
- He'll give up, eventually. May I have the bait? We need a fourth for bridge.
- Okay, but this time we use MY cards.
- Last game I about went blind.
-
-
-
-
-
- You're going to hurt me now, aren't you? Unless you act posthaste to rectify this unfortunate situation. Garfield, if you exercised you'd have more energy.
-
- And that's good. Ah. A, springtime!
- A time when...uh...um...
- What DOES happen in springtime? You hold your arm in the air? Garfield, you meed to do some work. Uh huh.
- You can help me in the garden. Sure.
- I made this little plow. You have WAAAY too much time on your hand. I got you a surprise, Garfield!
-
- But I can't find it. It wouldn't have been, sorta, kinda resembled a (burp) box of donuts, would it? My date said she hates me more than almost anything.
-
- ALMOST anything. I caught that. I am bored, Garfield.
- I need some excitement.
- Maybe I'll sit on the roof! Joooon?! The fire department said never do that again.
- What a nice day for a walk in the woods.
- Pooky!
- What are you doing out here?! I thought I left you at the camp...
- ...site...
-
- Momma! Hi, mom...I miss you too.
- Yes, I realize it's been a long time since I visited you...
- Yeeesss, I realize you're not getting any younger... I'll pack my food bowl and teddy bear. I just love car trips...
- They make me feel like SINGING!
- SLAM! SLAM! Boys?...Boys? Mom! Jonny!
- Dad! Son!
- Jelly belly! Lame brain! Brothers. Good to see you again, son. You're looking well. Thanks...you too, dad.
-
- Well, got chores to do. Better go unpack. (sniff) A real father-son moment. Garfield isn't much for the farm life, is he, Jonny? I guess not, mom.
- But he'll learn to cope. AAAGGHH!
- Only THREE channels?!! See that, Garfield? Those are sheep. Look like dust bunnies with legs.
- That's where wool comes from. Hold on...
- If this is anything like that chicken/egg thing, I DON'T wanna know.
- Sure is a beautiful sunset, dad.
- Yup.
- Sunsets are very popular on the farm...
- Very popular. What are you? I'm a rooster.
- What do you do? I wake you up at the crack of dawn.
- I didn't hear the rooster this morning. I imagine it's tough to crow with baling twine tied around one's beak. Remember that tree, Jon? Our bull chased you up that tree. Yeah, dad.
- Boy, you were stuck up there a LONG time... I remember, dad.
- How old were you? Seven and eight. So how's life in the big city, Jon?
- It's wild!
- Sometimes I stay up till ten. MA! Farming can be dangerous, Garfield.
- There are warning signs all over. -""Do not tickle the bull""? That's a biggie. I have a girlfriend now, Jon. Really?
- Want to see a picture of her? Sure!
- What do you think? Saaaay... That's one shiny tooth. I'd like to stay and visit, Jon, but I have a date.
- Look at that ugly holstein over there.
- That's my date. You shouldn't wear polka dots, lady.
- skitter skitter
- *click* Scout to base...
- No sign of cat...proceed.
-
- WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!
- Scout to base...uh, how's your sense of humor? This room would look better with less cat hair.
- There's no cat hair in here except what's on me.
- Hey! This is Mrs. Spittle, my third grade teacher.
- She hated me. She made me take summer school.
- She was okay, I guess. ...thus the lovingly rendered horns, goatee, and blacked-out tooth... PLay dead, Odie!
- Good boy!
- Now, stay. A what?...on your WHAT?!
- Yes, Mrs. Feeny, I'll look into it.
- DEAD GERBIL ON HER GLIDER?! Not my work. Way too obvious. Uh-oh.
- Bad sign.
- Jon's kite came home without him. Good coffee.
- Hot coffee. Here it comes...
- Gooooooood hot coffee. Sigh. bzzzzzzz
-
-
-
-
- ...and to your right is a house cat. Now let's move to the living room.
- Do you feel a draft? You lef tthe door open, dipwad. When I look around the room and see how dirty it is...
- I think it's time we do something about it.
- Got the blindfolds right here. Gimme the blue one. I'm going to meditate.
- You do that.
- Z I could use a little meditation myself. Who wants to have fun?
- Not me! Not me!
- Mr. Ball of Yarn needs some attention. You two have a lovely life together. A great new store opened up, Garfield!
- It's called ""Create-A-Pet"".
- I now have a bunny! Who maims. Hey, Tima, I'm throwing a party saturday night. Want tom come?
-
- YEEES, I'll be there. Party pooper. Garfield, weekends are my time to rear back and howl! Close.
- ...lie down and giggle? Closer.
- ...crawl into a fetal position and whimper? There you go. Z
- Z Z Z Z

- Z If sleeping is an art, then I'm a masterpiece. click (drivel)
- click (nonsense)
- (nonsensical drivel) At last! This is one long movie.
- It's going on like, FOREVER!
- Where's the remote? You're sitting on the pause button, techno boy. Welcome to ""Recycle that Roadkill."" What have we got tonight, Bob?
- Hard to tell, Chuck...he's pretty flat...
- Might make a nice coaster. With great big eyes. And your avocation, sir, is? I squish spiders.
- Care to demonstrate? Certainly.
- SQUISH! Lousy form. No follow-through at all. ...we DID have some amazing footage of that downtown fire, but DAN in editing accidentally ERASED it...
- So, instead of exciting fire footage, we present DAN in his undershirt and boxer shorts playing a comb with tissue paper:
- ffft ** ffft ** ffft **
- I'd take this over a fire any old day. Z Z
- Z Z
- This has been ""Nap Along with Fluffy"". YAWN Let's check the ol' message machine. click
- *beep*...Jon, this is Cindy. I've changed my name. You'll never find me! Ha! Ha! Ha!
- *beep* ...Jon?...Marsha...I can't date you because I'm allergic toboring.
- *beep*...Jon, thi is Nancy. Don't come over. You'll never get over the moat.
- *beep*...Jon, this is Mary...I bought a vicious dog trained to attack at the scent of bad cologne.
- *beep*...Jon, this is Sandy. Call one more time and I'll break your dialing finger.
- Sooooo... So get rid of the answering machine. It's scaring me! SMACK
- Spring is here...
- The first robin of the season just flew into the picture window. Don't you love springtime, Garfield?
- The warmth...thle flowers.
- Even you are smiling! I have a mouth full of butterflies. I pushed Odie off the roof!
- Fortunately, his fall was broken when he landed on Jon.
- Come closer, Garfield. Look, Odie! He crawled in here all by himself! Garfield, you sleep too much. I have a condition.
- And there's a name for that. ""Exerciseophobia"".
- Lazy! The fear of sweat. There was a cookie on this plate a minute ago...
- And I want to know where it went!
- It's enjoying the company of the missing pork chop. This cat food contains tuna-flavored chicken...
- That looks like beef.
- I prefer the beef-flavored tuna that looks like chicken.
-
- How's it going, Giant Hamburger?
- Giant Hamburger?
- You're dreaming. That's what I assumed.
-
- NEVER ASSUME! Here are your menus, hon. I love diners.
-
- Oooh, I have a heartburn already! I'm in deep-fried heaven. Hmm...the green-bean burrito looks good...
-
- Sorry, we're out of that. I owe you one, Irma. Would you like extra horseradish sauce on your garlic-onion-sardine sandwich?
-
- Sure.
- No goodnight kiss for you. There's a note in my sandwich.
- It says, ""inspected by number 23"".
- They inspected my tuna melt? That, or the cook's wearing a new shirt. My compliments to the chef! I'll tell him.
-
- He says he could use a hug. I hated MY meal. Ahhh...a filling meal at a greasy diner. Burrraap.
- Then home to fall asleep on the couch in front of the TV!
- Check! It just doesn't get any better than this.
- Almost ready...
- KACHING! CLONK My eye!
- Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
- SPLORT!
- WAAAAH SCHLIIIP!!!!
- Here's your toast. I think I'll just have a cold bagel instead. Wake up, Garfield!
- The whole world is waiting for you!
- Tell the world to get a life. I really should cut the grass...but it's such a nice day.
- Maybe I'll water it instead.
- What's with the sunglasses? You're blinding me with your logic. I thought Odie was chasing you around the tree out back.
- He is.
- I don't think he's caught me yet. There were three dozen cookies on this plate...
- And now they're gone!
- BAD PLATE! You know, Odie...
- The scret to looking good is to accessorize.
- You know, Garfield, I'm not really boring.
- I'm mellow.
- I have a laid-back personality.
- That's why we buried it in the backyard three years ago. Went with the lowest bidder. Beware of Dog
- Ah, the simple, direct approach. Beware of DOG
- Self-explanatory. Beware of DUMB MUTT
- High-tech mixed breed. Beware of ||||||||
- No threat there. Beware of Poochie.
-
- I believe we have a winner. You'd never guess you were going to be 23. Why, you're as active as you ever were.
-
- Ha, ha, very funny! So you'll be a year older...so what?
- Birthdays are a celebration of life!
- Yeah, we can decorate your walker with streamers and everything! WHO LET HIM IN?!! Garfield, will you play with me? Go away, Nermal.
- We could run and laugh! Go away, Nermal.
- Or in your case, waddle and wheeze. Come closer, Nermal. Look on the bright side, Garfield...
- Every year, your birthday is a gift! Yeah, yeah.
- A gift with no exchanges or returns. I hear you have a birthday coming up...how old? 23.
- What would that be in spider years? Don't know...no spider has ever lived that long.
- Whoa, how ironic was THAT? Instead of making a list of things I want for my birthday...
- I made a list of things I DON'T want.
- Raisins? So, birthday number 23 is coming up, eh?
- You're only as young as you feel, pal! snap!
- A kitty treat!
- crick snao
-
-
-
- And today I feel around a hundred and sixty-one. Sigh...tomorrow I'm turning 23...
- Don't get me wrong...I LOVE birthdays.
- But why do so many of them have to be MINE?! It's my birthday and I get to do anything I want!
- ...don't wake me!
- Whee... Z Garfield, get out of that bed! Where's your sense of wonder?
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- They ran off with my sense of humor. You didn't eat that hamburger?
- I'm so proud of you.
- squeak squeak squeak Well, I'm afraid Odie's a little disappointed in YOU. Z
- It's nice when Garfield's asleep. He can't annoy me. Z
- Z Step right this way, ladies and gentlemen.
- Here we have one of nature's wonders.
- The bottomless pit. I want to be left alone. Sigh .
- These are the days that I love.
- Days when you can lie in one spot from sunrise to sunset, while absolutely nothing happens.
- No crises, no accomplishments, no nothing.
- Just yourself and a quiet, serene, and peaceful day.
-
- He followed me home. Can I keep him? I just couldn't leave well enough alone. It's comedy time!
-
- Am I the only one who thinks bow ties are funny? I shall now make my assistant disappear.
- BOOT!
- Not very magical, but pretty entertaining! THUD! A funny thing happened on the way to the fence tonight...
- ALL RIGHT!
- YEAH! LET'S GO THERE! I hate you all. So, anybody here from out of town?
- Yes, I am from the planet Uranus.
- Entertain me or die, earthling! I hate these late shows. Who wants to hear a song? I do! Me too! Sure!
- Any requests?
- Turn on the radio! Yeah! That would be great! How do you like the show so far?
- Z Z Z Z Z Z
- All right! A standing nap! Z Z Z Z Z Z Z

- A little espresso goes a long way. CRASH!
- CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!
- That Odie is not a plate catcher. I hear nothing. You know, most cats don't get to have ice cream.
- All right!
- All the more for me! You seem content, Jon.
- Looks like I got her ejust in time.
- Go away, Garfield. I'm here to suck the joy out of your life. Odie sure is enjoying that rawhide chew I gave him.
- I can't find my new belt.
- That explains the buckle. I feed Jon's canary every day.
- It's a selfless act on my part.
- But soon it will be harvest time. Does this outfit make me look mysterious?
- Absolutely!
- I think dorks are very mysterious. Beware of Dog
- Beware of Dog

- SOMEBODY GRAB A HOUSE SLIPPER, QUICK! So, I see you have a walking cast now. Yeah.
- I'd ask you to sign it, but I hate your stinking guts, you fat tub of lard!
- You may squish me, but you'll never squish my spirit!
- KER SMACK
- How's your spirit, Stewart? Bite me, Mikey. I want you to squish my lousy no-good husband!
- Then I want you to pound him into mulch, and the rip his legs off and stuff them down his craw!
- He gave you vacuum cleaner bags for your wedding anniversary again, didn't he? CANISTER bags! ...and I have an upright! Have you seen my sister?
- SMACKO
- Have you seen my brother? I think so. Does he look like this? See the cat today= Yep.
- And he DIDN'T squish you?! Oh, sure he did.
- This is a black body cast. donk donk
-
-
- Garfield...
- I wouldn't keep teasing the dog in that pickup.
- You never know when we might come to a red light.
- Like this one. Cats are very complicated.
- You're a lump.
- Cats are very complicated lumps. Says here a cat will always land on its feet.
-
- Riiight. I subscribe to the ""bounce"" school of thought. Jon's iced tea.
- flick
- A la Garfield. I'll go get the broom...
- And sweep up all that cat hair. OKay, but first...
- I'd just like to stand here and admire it awhile. You know what I love about cats, Garfield? You're so refined...
- HAAAACK!!
- Ahem...you were saying? Life offers us many challenges.
- And that's why I'm going to hide behind the couch.
- Don't tell life.
-
-
-
-
-
- Can you PLEASE speed it up a little?! Flea dip day. I am a magic donut!
- I can grant you any wish!
- How about a glass of milk? All of us have a destiny, Garfield.
- I wonder what my place in history will be?
- Somewhere between Floyd the Whistling Snake and crab grass. Odie is trying to annoy me.
- He's making that noise I hate.
- That continouous breathing sound. Do you ever stop to realize all you out me through?!
-
- You know, I never did! I've tried every girl in my address book except Loretta Gnish.
-
- I wonder if she ever had surgery to remove that third nostril? He's weakening. You forgot my birthday.
- No, I didn't.
- I didn't care. Garfield!
- Garfield! I'm stuck in the wall!
- Don't ask how...just DO somethin!
-
-
-
- Okay, you're having a cruel laugh at my expense, aren't you? Did you bring the paper in?
-
- GARFIELD! Kidding! I saved the funnies! I wonder what time it is?
- ** OW! ** OW! ** OW!
- It's three. Too close to the cuckoo clock.
-
- * FEEELINGS... What is a karaoke machine doing in the living room? AAAAGGGHHH
- WHO TORE THE LAST PAGE OUT OF THE MYSTERY BOOK I WAS READING?!
- The cat did it. I walked my date to the door. And then what happened?
- I kissed her hand... And then what happened?
- Leaving her othe rhand free... And then what happened? I sat on a bee today.
- So I'm not happy.
- I'll bet the bee isn't exactly gleeful, either. Z
- Spiders are your frieeeeeends... Z
- You liiiiiiiike spiders. Z
- You would nevvvvvvvvvvvvver hurt a spider... Z
- Next Moring: Morning, friend!
- SMACK!
- I'm a liiiiiiight sleeeeeper.
-
- Tah da! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Dog treat.
- Yeh! Yeh! Yeh! Yeh! They're so easy. Tonight we have with us a man who thinks he's a dog...how are you, sir?
- Dogs can't talk, Phil. But you just did.
- Uh...I mean, ""arf"". People will do anything to get on TV. The toaster doesn't work, Garfield.
- I'll take it to the garage and fix it. Not the garage!
- That's where all small appliances go to die. I know why you won't go out with me, Cindy.
- You think I'm stupid, don't you?...
- Darn, I was hoping that wasn't it. You were hoping for ""loser,"" maybe? DING-DONG
- squeek squeek squeek squeek squeek
- Who was it? Just some clown. Ahem...
- If you want a cookie, you'll have to move.
-
-
-
- I forgot how far cats can stretch. Now, I think I'll get some milk out of our neighbor's refrigerator. Mom used to tuck me into bed at night.
- She'd kiss me on the forehead and say, ""nighty-night"".
- Then dad would tiptoe in and whisper, ""Beware the chicken!"" I've always liked your dad. Look, Garfield! A package from my mom! I wonder what it is?!
- I hope it's cookies! I hope it's a ham!
- It's ham-shaped cookies! Mom shoots! Mom SCORES! We couldn't afford doctors on the farm.
- We relied on natural remedies.
- Did you know that kissing a chicken cures cold sores? Get away from me. News from the farm, Garfield...a letter from Doc Boy.
- ""Maddie Ferguson's pie took first place at the fair...""
- ""So mom burned her barn down"". All right, mom! Garfield is fine, mom...want to talk to him?
-
- What's she saying? She's saying she can't believe she's talking to a cat on a long-distance call. We got a post card from Doc Boy!
- He's vacationing on Loogieville, Indiana.
- ...says he had his picture taken with the world's largest corn cob. Eiffel Tower, eat your heart out.
- You have a nice, peaceful, long, restful nap.
-
-
-
-
- I don't need that kind of pressure! WHOP! poo I've decided to do nothing...just like you.
- Good luck, pal.
- NOBODY can do nothing like me. Garfield, I found a treasure. A record album?
- It's a classic. ""Mel Tweedy's best farm tunes""?
- It has all the hits! ""Our love's gone dry and so has the cow."" I learn from my mistakes.
- Wow.
- There goes the world's smartest man!
- pant pant pant
- Leather breath. Hey! Where's my other shoe?! I bought this box of candy for my date!
- And I ate it.
- We're a team! Well, the dishes are washed.
-
- Maybe I'll wax them. It's the weekend that wouldn't end.
- AH HA!
- Oh. You're not doing anything.
-
- AH HA! Oh, You're still not doing anything.
-
- AH HA! I'll let you know. I think I'll take a nap.
- Then doze awhile...and then top it all off with a nice snooze.
- Remember, kids, fo well-balanced rest, you must have something from the three basic sleep groups each day. Hmf!
- If you continue to lie there like that, you're going to atrophy!
- I'd go to the dictionary to look that up, but my legs have withered. I'm bored!
- Reeeally bored.
- I'm so bored it's almost interesting. Maybe there IS something to lying on your back...maybe I should try it.
-
- Look at all the GUM stuck under this table! Close your eyes, dipwad. I'm going out for a while.
- Don't bother waiting...
- ...up for me. Z That's what you wre doing last time I saw you!
-
- I'm a rerun. click
- Welcome to ""Collegiate Face Slapping""!
- Good luck, gentlemen. Shake hands and come out slapping!
- * ding:: slap slap slap slap slappy slappy slap slap slappity slappity slap *poink* Uh-oh! We have a penalty flag.
- So, sorry, contestant number one, but your last slap was, in fact, an eye poink.
- Two points off... Two points?! That wasn't an eye poink! HERE'S an eye poink!
- POINK And the ref goes down! What did we ever do before 32 sports channels? Garfield, what's wrong with this picture?
-
-
- Boy, it's boring in here!
- I couldn't have done it without you, Odie. CRUNCH
- CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH
- Time to go grocery shopping, Garfield. Sugar cube sandwich. BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Gum?
- mmmb! mmmb! mmmb! I love dogs. It's the weekend.
- Boredom is at the door.
- Hey, watermelon seeds stick to your face! And walks right in without knocking. I'm going to show Ellen my intellectual side.
- I'm writing a list of books I've read.
- ""Ducky's Big Pond""? No pictures in that on, pal! slam!
- I just passed Mrs. Feeny on the sidewalk.
- Her arm was in a sling. She was wearing a neck brace.
- She had a walking cast...
- And her jaw was wired shut.
- She gave me a very nasty look.
- You wouldn't know anything about tthis, would you? No, An I don't know what happened to your ball bearing collection, either. click click He WHAT?!
- Could you hold for a moment? I have another call coming in...thanks. *boop*
- He WHAT?! I'v been a busy boy. We all have to live together.
- We have to be considerate of our neighbors.
- So return those to Mrs. Feeny! Can I keep the pearls? Mrs. Feeny's little dog is missing again...
- And all those stamps I bought yesterday are gone, not to mention a box and some twine!
- Take your time...it'll come to you. Deal? Deal.
-
- Where was that mouse going with a dollar? To run up Mrs. Feeny's leg. May I borrow the video camera? WHOCK! SLAP! GOUGE-GOUGE SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
- That was Mrs. Feeny at the door for you...
- She said, when she catches you, she's going to do THIS to you. I think I'll stay in today. You'll have to speak louder, Mrs. Feeny! I can't hear you over all that racket!
- He put what?!... HOW many?!
- WHERE did you find fifteen howler monkeys?! riiiing * That would be the zoo. *
- Dum, dee dum, dee dum...
- Hi, spider. Uh, hi, cat...
- pat pat pat
- Wow! I must be dreaming!
- STOMP Z YAAAHHH!!! POOOEY!!! Garfield, why do I keep dwelling on the past?
- Because you have no future?
- Here's my first pocket protector. AND no past. There's Patty Evans, my date for the junior prom.
- I remember I was so nervous pinning the corsage on her.
- She said she'll always have the scar to remembe rme by. Okay, lemme see. That's coach Beck.
- He was a tough tobacco-chewin' old football coach.
- He always spit in my helmet. Good thing you never used it. ""Geek""...""Loser""...""Creep""...
- ""Freak""...""Dork boy""...
- ""You stink!"" Reading the inscriptions in his high school yearbook. Beth Nardone, now THERE was a girl!
- She broke my heart...
- AND my jaw. Boy meets girl, boy loses teeth. Belinda Gilzone...I had a mad crush on her.
- She was head cheerleader.
- Ever had an entired pompon shoved up your nose? Let me thibk.....no.
-
- sniff
- sniff sniff

- Do you MIND? Mondays don't scare me...
- * TOIIIIIIIING * FOOMP
- Oh, sure, they cheese me off, but they don't scare me.
-
- Fun with tape! Morning. Morning.

- So, what's it like to lick a spark plug? Cats are primal, Jon.
- I have the urge to prowl.
- Go away.
- Gimme your car keys. YAWN scratch scratch
- BURP
- She seemed nice. sniff sniff
- What smells so good? Cream of canary.
- Chunky style. I am so VERY sorry...
- That was Mrs Feeny again. Do tell.
- Why do you torture that woman so? Because she's there.
- ...hiding her dentures?! She bites when she's angry.
- Sneaking her little dog laxative-laced bran muffins?! What's so irregular about that?
- ...soaping her car windows with the words ""Feeny is a weenie""?!! You know I can't spell...I paid a kid to do that!
- What am I going to do with you?! Relax...here, have a bran muffin. Hey, Jon!
- Look at me!
- I'm i three rooms at the same time! Diet time! You're fat.
- No, no, I am big boned.
- Godzilla was big boned...you're fat. No more snacks for you, Garfield. Fine.
- You are on a strict diet. Whatever you say.
- And I filled in the tunnel to the refrigerator. My life is over. It's not the dieting that gets to me.
-
- It's the NOT EATING part!!! Aren't you going to eat your dinner?
- I'm deciding.
- I may just weep instead. Garfield...
- How's the diet going? Great!
- You have frosting on your lips. I pillaged a bake sale.
- A candy bar! ...but I'm on a diet...
- This must be a test...
- -or a trick...
- Test...trick...test..trick...
- GRAB
- SQUEEK! AH-HA! Both. Well, one good thing about this diet...
- -at least I haven't had any of those weird...
- Hey, pal, how's about a snack? Hallucinations. Saaay...YOU'Re looking hungry. You're just a dietary hallucination. GO away.
- I can't, until you stop obsessing about me.
- I'd like you to meet a close, dear and personal obsession of mine. I'm a donut...eat me! No you're not. You're just a diet-induced hallucination.
- Now I'm frosted! Sorry. You're not real.
- With sprinkles! All right. Come here. There has GOT to be an easier way to lose weight.
- You could exercise.
- munch munch munch munch munch Nummm. I don't tink I can eat all of my lettuce leaf.
-
- BECAUSE I'M PLANNING TO PASS OUT FROM HUNGER! Celery!
- If science could find a use for it, we wouldn't have to eat it to get rid of it!
- Diet starting to get to you?
- Hey, cat...
- I've been thinking a lot about my mortality lately. Oh?
- Yeah, is the afterlife a continuation of the journey of one's spirit, or is it more of an ephemeral thing?...
- Could it be a new beginning?...A portal to a new and better place?...
- SLAP
- See any bright light? No...just lots of stars and birdies. **** If you finish your carrot, you may have another.
-
- Finished. That was the vet. She says you can go off your diet now.
- THUD
- Are you all right?! Quick! Mouth-to-leat loaf resuscitation! You're being annoying, Odie.
- Still annoying.
- Not quite getting the drif, are you, pal? Your pointy elbows give me a headache.
- You lost me there, Jon...
- That makes no sense at all. Why am *I* always having to beg for dates?! I'm going to let the girls call ME!
-
- Dr. Livingstone, I presume? Garfield, the kid across the street has lost his turtle.
- You don't say.
- Can he describe it? Burp

- Veeeeeery little life left.
-
- A cookie chocolate chip. Good dog.
- Bad dog.
- Complex, aren't they? Does the word ""glutton"" mean anything to you?
- How about ""hog boy""?
- How about ""Mister Fatty-Fat-Fat""?!! People without donuts are so bitter. Some people think of pets as their children.
-
- So...dad. Do you have a will? I have a date with Cindy, Garfield.
- She likes the strong, silent type.
- So I'm dressed as a muscle-bound mime. Try not to get beat up. Haven't we met somewhere before?
- Yes.
- I wonder if that's good or bad. She's picking up a rock!
- Ahhh...there she is.
- A little to the left...
- A little more...that's it...
- A liiiiiiiitle more...
- *snap* THUD WOOOOOOH!
- WHO dug the the tiger trap in Mrs. Feeny's flower bed?! WEEEEEEE I love sirens.
-
- Oh, Garfield, may I have a word with you? Can it wait? I'm busy chasing the mouse.
-
- And don't come back! Too late. * ching ching
- * ching ching
- We seem to be infested with cowboys. nok nok
- May I borrow a cup of sugar? Sure.
- I said a CUP, not a thimble! I can't win here. Garfield! Present.
- What?
- He didn't seem very happy. The man is an enigma. The mice and I have an agreement.
- I don't eat them... *
- And they don't booby trap the litter box. brrrrrr
- It is FREEZING in here!
- Ah-HA! I knew I still had those old rubber arms!
-
-
- Get away from that thermostat! Dinner's running late.
- Fine.
- Any last words? You wouldn't be so happy if you were seeing what I'm seeing.
-
- How long have you been carrying that around waiting for me to say that? OW!!
- Garfield, you oaf! That was my foot you stepped on!
- GAAAHH Now you have a matched set. Why, yes, Judy, I am as masculine as I sound.
- O.K. Judy, you'r eon!
- I just bought three thousand dollars worth of windows. Was Judy as slick as she sounded? DING DONG ** That's my date. Now be nice.
- EEEEEK!
- I havened even OPENED the door yet! Just getting it out of the way.
- Wow... Two beautiful days in a row! I hate reruns.

- My hero!
- STOMP! Beware of the Dog
- Monday, Wednesday and Friday
- It's tuesday. Pencil me in for tomorrow.
- Hey!
- I went to high school with that sweater! So, did you finally get enough to eat?
- Depends...
- Is there anything left? So why won't you go out with me?
- What?! Not MANLY enough?!
- Boy, that'll take the starch out of your petticoat. Easy, big fella. What do you think of my new suit? YAAAHHH!
- MY EYES! MY EYES!
- And don't sugarcoat it. YAWN
- pat pat pat
- Nope.
-
- Rats.
- The heck with it.
- I thought you were napping. Couldn't find my spot. I wonder if I should go for a walk...
- No way! I refuse!
- I'm outvoted. Whenever things are missing they call on a dog to track it down.
-
- Has it occured to anyone that dogs might be taking that stuff to begin with? The world is constantly changing.
-
- They haven't stopped making frozen pudding pops, have they? Beware of the Artistic Dog
- ZIP scribble scribble scribble
- My nose isn't that big! Garfield, I'm going to ask the first woman I see to go out.

- It's catching! So did you put up a tree and everything? Oh, yeah.
- Only this year we went with an artificial one. Artificial?
- Yeah, it's one of those pine-scented air fresheners shaped like a douglas fir. Guess what, Ellen...I have a mistletoe!
- If I hold it over your head, you have to kiss me.
- Yeah, well, it's the law, Ellen! There are worse things than jail. We now return to ""Edward Fernbergle, The Certified Public Accountant Who Saved Chistmas"".
- * RIIING * RIIING Hello?
- Santa, the elves have been skimming from petty cash! Ed! You've saved us! Slap them in tiny irons! Hi, mom? It's Jon.
- I'm calling because I need your top-secret recipe for Christmas cookies!
- No, mom, the line is not tapped. Are you SURE? Before too long it'll be time to get a new Christmas tree.
- So I guess we ought to take the old one down. Can't we just scoot it over...
- Next to the other one? Hi, mom!
- Just called to wish you happy holidays, mom! Wha?...yes, I ate just a few hours ago...hmm? Who? Sure! Put him on!
- Hi'ya, dad! Happy holidays! ...I'm fine...yep, changed my oil last week...grandma? Sure! Put her on!
- Hi, grandma! ...I said HI!! ...nope...still single...SINGLE!!...SINGLE!!!
- Doc Boy?... DOC BOY?! SURE...PUT HOM ON!!!
- Hello? Hello?
- Talk into the other end, Doc Boy! Happy holidays, all you family members out there. I'm looking for a Christmas tree. Who isn't?
- A great big one! I like your style.
- Let's talk HUGE! Let's talk financing. I can't believe what you charge for a Christmas tree!
- Well, we do also sell the kit... Kit?
- This ia PINE CONE! Some assembly required. I'm going out to hang the Christmas lights on the house.
- Remember now... I know, I know...
- If I hear a scream, call the fire department. For a scream and a ""bzzzt,"" call the power company. For a scream, a ""bzzzt"" and a ""thud"", call an ambulance. shake shake shake
- You're not peeking, are you?
- Only with my ears.
- SNIFFFFFFFF
- You're looking cheerful this morning. I just tanked up on Christmas spirit. Hi, cat. Hi, flea.
- Just wanted to stop by and say merry Christmas before I take off. Where to?
- Oh, I'm catching a Greyhound to Kansas City.
-
-
- pop
-
-
- Merry Christmas. Christmas Eve, and I can't sleep.
- I need a sedative.
- Quick, tell me a story about your boyhood on the farm. Hey!
- You know, that Santa is even nicer than I thought...
- He left ME a cookie. Hi, mom?...it's Jon.
- About that sweater you made Garfield for Christmas?...
- YOu left out a hole. How fo you leave OUT a hole?! Karen, how'd you like to go out with me on new year's eve?
- What's it worth to you?
- Uh...paint your house? I like this one already. None of the girls I called want to go out with me on new year's eve.
-
- Maybe if I called them again and used a french accent... Who needs cable TV when you've got this? Can you believe it?! Patti broke our date, and now I'm stuck with two tickets to the new year's eve dance!
- Now what do I do? Duh...
- Go stag, scalp the other ticket at the door, and buy me something. Sigh...come with me...
-
-
-
-
- We need a blow-dryer, and a really, really long extension cord. Why can't I get a date for new year's eve, Garfield?
- Why, why, why, why?!
- WHY, WHY,WHY,WHY,WHY,WHY,WHY ?!! Can you say ""mature""? Everyone should do their best.
-
- Which, hopefully, will allow me to get by without doing much of anything! I'm not getting enough out of life.
- I must expend more effort!
- Z Z Welcome to ""Cat Aerobics"".
- Ready? Breathe! SNIIIIIFFF!
- Now breathe again. WHOA! You're killing me here! How about a hug, Garfield?
- Candy? Biscuit? Seafood?
- No hug? I need motivation. *beep*...you have no messages. click
- *beep* You still have no messages. click
- Here's a message for you... YOU'RE A LOSER! Stop tormenting it.
- Cat hair!! There is cat hair EVERYwhere!!
- No! Wait!
- HA! You MISSED a spot!

-
- I must be slipping. AAAGGGHH! Happy cat.
- Angry cat.
- Happy-to-be-angry cat. We're having leftovers for dinner, Garfield...
- Meat loaf...
- And something yellow. Mustard. I'll tell myself it's mustard. I'm going to make a list of things I can do to impress women.
-
- ""Can make a list..."" He's writing that in INK, ladies! I'm not saying Jon has a bad wardrobe.
- But I just looked into his closet.
- Two hundred moths committed suicide. I'm depressed, Ellen.
- I could use a good word.
- That's a bad word, Ellen. Don't sugarcoat it, Ellen. You're breaking up with me?
- But we've never dated.
- you don't want to take any chances? Better safe than sorry.
-
- To be, or not to be: That is the question.
- ** Gotta sing! Gotta dance! *
- The ballet patrons go wild as Garfield pirouettes his way into their hearts!
-
- Sooooooooo...what have you been up to? Being ignored, mostly. Garfield, I don't think you could get any fatter.
-
- That wasn't a challenge! I'll need cupcakes. I went shopping, Garfield. Feed me.
- Spent every cent I had. Feed me.
- These moose hats aren't cheap. Shoot me. And so ends another day!
-
- Why did Odie go back to bed? I'll be having his breakfast. Who deserves the last donut?
- To be honest...
- It probably would have been you. This is really amazing, Garfield.
- I have called every woman I know.
- They all have a cold.
- Probably caught it in group therapy. Do you have any unfulfilled dreams, Garfield?
- Oh, sure.
- There's the one about the 12-foot chocolate eclair... Ahem...
- ...a word with you?
- The PET door is for PETS...
- And the DOOR door is for people. NO exceptions.
- You know that, and you've ALWAYS known that.
- So I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to return your house key.
- Sorry about that. It's okay. I had copies made. Here's a joke. How many mice does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
- Mice don't change lightbulbs. You see lightbulbs are too large and cumbersome, not to mention that it's much easier for us to pilfer food in the dark.
- That joke took a sobering turn.
- What are you going to do about all these mice?
- Get them name tags? Garfield, how do you explain this?
-
- Hmmm...new mouse, higher-than-average disposable income, heavily into baroque rococo, I'd say.
- I have the mouse chasing himself.
- That's called delegating authority. There goes a mouse!
- Aren't you going after him? Perhaps...
- That is, if he's going to the beach. Well, I have to get back to work as a household pest.
- Sigh.
- All the good jobs are taken. You're filthy!

- It'll make it easier on the rest of us. I'm sorry, Mrs. Feeny...
- Yes, I'll look into it. SLAM!
- Is that Mrs. Feeny's Wig?! It followed me home. Nothing can go wrong if I just sit here.
- kkkkk
- That man never ceases to amaze me. Fear not, Jon!
- I've put Odie to work protecting out house and valuables!
- Take Anything But The Food Edna, I might be late picking you up tonight.
- Well, my head is stuck in a wastebasket.
- It's a long st...saaay...my voice sounds deeper... Don't wait up, Edna. I'm staring at you, Garfield!
- What do you think of that?
- Heeey, who WOULDN'T want to stare at me? I can't believe it!
- ...things were going so well...
- I was clean-shaven, wearing my best cologne...
- -had made a reservation for two at a wonderful restaurant...
- We'd ordered our meals...
- I was telling her stories about my boyhood on the farm...
- And then she nearly drowned. Third one this month to fall asleep in her soup. You are MIN, and mine alone!

- Right in the mudhole, Doug. Who says there's nothing good before sunrise? Welcome to ""I'm So Special!""
- ...and what makes you ""so special,"" sir? I can whistle the national anthem out of my left nostril.
- And your right nostril? That's where I unfurl a tiny flag. Let's hear it for patriotism. Tonight, a mad scientist puts a dog's brain into a zombie.

- Mrs. Feeny reports her chihuahua has been varnished a dark cherry.
- SOMEone duct taped Odie to our satellite dish...
- -There's been so much shedding going on that *I* hacked up a hairball this morning!

-
- That'll do, thank you. Give me a cookie and I'll go away. Odie is planning to chase his tail.
- But being the good sport he is...
- He's going to give it a head start. Success isn't everything it's crackes up to be.

- ...and you would this becaaaause?... Sammy Sock Puppet says he can whip your sock puppet.
- You talkin' 'bout Billy Boot?
- Not fair! And the war escalates... Ellen, I would ford the mightiest river for you!
- Aha?

- Then I thought about standing up...
- Then I stood up. It actually takes Jon longer to tell about his day than to live it.
- Herman! Long time no see! Well, hi, cat!
- So, how's the wife and kids? Great, just great! You're looking good...
- Thanks! I

- HA! HA! HA! HA! WAH-HA! HA! Diner humor. What's the catch of the day? Pan-fried ugly fish.
- Uhhhcan you serve it without its head? No.
- Why not? 'cause then it wouldn't be UGLY now, would it? How are your ribs? Ticklish.

- What if we were the last two people on earth?
- Humanity is doomed. And cats will rule the world! You've just won ten million dollars!

- Why, I bet you have more fat than muscle.
- You take that back. Don't blink.

- Tol' ja. My hidden camera took there pictures of you stealing the last donut!

- You know why? I don't know, Jon...WHY?
- Because I have soul! No, Jon. You have an accordion. Hello, symphony orchestra?
- I noticed you don't have an accordion player.
- Yes, I'll stay on the line. While they trace the call. My girlfriend is ashamed to be with me. Amen, brother!
- She tried to run over it with her car. I feel your pain!
- But I won't be stopped! ""Accordions Anonymous"". I'm thinking our lawn needs something.
- I'm thinking of a lawn ornament.
- I'm thinking of a ten-foot concrete accordion. I'm thinking of moving. Who needs women, Garfield?
- All we need is a pair of tiny shoes, and...
- It's the dancing accordion! You need a woman. Accordion music isn't just music, Garfield.
- It's a way of life.
- And you get to wear leather shorts! Let's just leave it at that. Okay, Jon? Uhhh...
- Dinner will be a little late.
- The lasagna needs a few more minutes... The LASAGNA?!
- Stand aside...I'll be the judge of this!
- My sincerest apologies, you were right.
-
- HEY! BURP Garfield, let's think nice thoughts today.
-
- I'm floating on a cloud. I'm barbecuing a small woodland creature. Odie, this is going to hurt me more than it will you.
- BOOT! splat!
- Or maybe not... Still eating, Garfield?
- Soon your stomach will grow large and you will explode.
- He's like an evil fortune cookie. Have you lost weight?
-
- You beast! News flash! A deranged hamster is terrorizing the city!
- Residents are advised against filling their pockets with lettuce and lying in tall grass.
- Oh, great! There goes his weekend. Doc, I have a stomach ache.
- Indigestion?!...
- Ohhh...so it's NOT a parasitic alien life form bent on world conquest? You live alone, you get paranoid.
-
- BOOT!
-
-
-
- Stupid head wind. You're more than a pet to me, Garfield.
- You're like a son.
- A big, fat, worthless son! Lighten up, dad. I make a lot of things around here, Garfield.
- I make the house clean. I make the meals...
- I make the beds... And don't forget that continual whining sound. You have it so easy!
- Easy?...EASY?!
- I'm working without a mattress here! Let's make a list of your faults, Garfield.
- Fat, lazy, selfish... And...
- And let's not forget disrespectful. My personal favorite. When you were little, you'd lie on my lap and purr.
- BURP
- That was long, looong ago. I've matured nicely, don't you think? I'm tired of just lying here.
-
- Carry me someplace else. yank yank
-
- Hi, I'm a blueberry muffin and seem to have lost my way. Excuse me...
- I'm a butter pat and I'm also lost... Hi, Pat. Pardon...
- I'm a steaming-hot cup of coffee and I do believe I've taken a wrong turn.
- Even if this IS a dream, it's still the happiest moment in my life. I'm cold. Can you warm me up? Me too. I'm BURNING up...got any cream? Hey, parlez-vous francais, anyone?! I'm perfect.
- You're a mess.
- That's a PERFECT mess, bozo! Maybe someday they'll make a movie about my life.
- Whoa...
- Those poor stunt men! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
- Hey, Jon!
- Check out this comic about a fat, lazy human! I wonder if gravity is still working.
- PUSH
- It's nice to know that there are some things you can count on. THUD Women like a man of mystery, so I'm going to wear a mask on my date.
- This should be a hoot.
- Don't wait up. Take me with you. Ready to eat, Garfield? Excuse me?!
- I eat, I sleep. That's all I do. Do I look like I'm sleeping?
- Are you okay? DO YOU SEE A ""Z"" FLOATING OVEr MY HEAD?!
- That's me with my high-school chess club. Ah...
- The jocks hated us. They were probably intimidated by you guys.
- So one day I challenged one of them to a game of chess.
- I said, ""make the first move, you big lummox"".
- That's when he shoved his bishop up my nose.
- It's kind of hard to talk about. Not half as hard as it is to listen to. Somewhere out there is the woman for me.
-
- Hiding, no doubt. That was MY line! Uh-huh. I see. Okay. Makes sense. All right. I can't argure with that one.
- I had no idea there were so many reasons not to go out with me.
- * RIING She thought of some more. Besides beauty and intelligence...
- I need a woman who will respect me.
- A human woman? Evelyn, say you'll go out with me...
- Really?! You're not just saying that?!
- Oh, you are just saying that. Nice shot, Evelyn! I have to show Ellen that I love animals and children.
- So, I'm taking you on my date tonight.
- Now, where can I find a kid? I don't work with children. She loves me...she loves me not...
- She loves me...she despises the air I breathe.
- She loves me...she wishes my head would explode... Relay, Jon, relax.
- Your move.

- In ""Checkers with Cookies,"" there ARE no losers. Yer moof. Garfield!
- I thought you were getting up! I am.
- This has to be done in stages. Shades make you look cool.
-
- There's not a pair big enough, pal! Pet ownership is a two-way street, you know.
- I do expect some affection in return. No prob...
- Odie, owner, affection, now. I'll feed you in a minute, Garfield.
- Grrr Grrr
- What could he do? I had him outnumbered. I have a dilemma, Garfield. There's a girl who wants to go out with me saturday night.
- And she has a face that could stop a clock.
- So, what should I wear? Well, don't wear your watch. A cat is constantly on the move.
-
- I don't personally know this cat, but I've heard of him.
-
-
-
-
-
- Made you look! There's our cow, Bossie. She kicked me in the head once.
-
- She kicked me in the head once. Comes the dawn... ...and this is a picture of my prize rooster, Henry. That's a picture of an egg.
- He was much younger then. Ah...
- But he already had his dad's rugged good looks. You're scaring me, Jon. We had to make our own fun back on the farm...
- Doc Boy and I used to play a game with the electric fence we called ""Touch it, Whimp!""
- My fingers still tingle. And the brain's still numb. I remember back on the farm...my mother calling to me...
- ""Jon, you're boring the cattle!""
- Ever seen a cow yawn? Now you're boring the cat. Mom set me up on a blind date with a girl from back on the farm.
- She churns her own butter...
- ...and has a wonderful sense of humor. And has a wonderful sense of humor. Garfield, a letter from home!
- Just when I was feeling down, too.
- ""Dear son, the entire family fell off the roof"". I don't even want to know...
-
-
- Atta-boy, Garfield!
- Let that mouse have it! SHow no mercy!
- WHUMP! Way to go!
- The new arm-wrestling champ! Best two out of three? I know why you're so lazy, Garfield.
- Low self-esteem.
- You have to realize your worth. Did I say you could speak? I'm running in place!
- I'm just standing here.
- And I'm winning. Know why humans are smarter than cats, Garfield?
- Bigger brains. Ah...
- That explains those huge, ugly heads. Yip! Yip! Yap! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
- Odie, if you'll shut up, I'll give you a piece of candy.
- Yip! Yip! Yap! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Marcie, give me one good reason why you won't go out with me.
- I see.
- She hates, loathes, and is disgusted by every fiber of my being. I'll mark her down as a possible. Would you like to see me juggle flaming chain saws blindfolded?
- Or hear me sing?
- The first one!! Dogs don't get to vote.
-
-
-
-
-
- *TRIP* SPLAT! Graceful. I'm here! Let the party begin!
- SMACK!
- I'll open the chips. Fear me, cat! Fear my wrath! Fear my might!
- WHAP!
- Fear my flatness! Your husband's a celebrity now. Pardon me?
- Yeah, I saw him on the front page of the newspaper. Really?!
- MORTY! Flame IS fleeting.
-
- New hat? Thanks for noticing. Here's a picture of my kids.
- Whoa, they're disgusting!
- Why, thank you! ...and that's the story of my life.
- SMACK!

- Ow! Ow! Now my head hurts! Should've started with an easier one.
- I'm wearing mx boxer shorts backwards!
- I had a feeling something big was going to happen today. I have a lot on my mind.

- What goes first? The memory? The eyes? The back?
- The kitten. So I hear you're going to be 24. This is true.
- Wow! The things you've been witness to!
- What WAS life before fax machines?! It's too horrific to describe. How do you intend to celebrate your birthday? What do you mean?
- Well...
- Are you gonna wheeze out a few candles? Run for your life. So I'll soon be 24. That means I will be older and wiser...
- HA! HA! HA! HA!

-
- I seeeeeee... Wait, wait, there's more.
-
- Happy birthday, big guy! I'm not eating that. You should do some sit-ups.
- I don't know...
- It might cause me to spill my milkshake. Aha! He can only get his hand out if he lets go of the cookie.
- What will he do?
- He will use his wits and your head.
-
- You know better than to stand between me and the kitchen when it's snack time.
- It's Garfield!
- Oh sure, lay pressure on me!
- Do you realize all the responsibility that is attendant to being Garfield?!
- The eating of food?! The taking of naps?! The kicking of Odie?!

- EEEERRGGGHHH Vending machine.
- OOO! OOO! OOO! OOO! OOO! Hot tub.
- Let's go get some ice cream. Cool down.
- Shhhh
- Stalking the wild pizza. You two should stop being so competitive.
- Okay, Jon, we will.
- But since you brought the subject up, which one of us would you say was more competitive? You know, Garfield...
- Life is strange.
- So is your shirt, but you don't hear me blaming life for it. Garfield, would you miss me if I went away?
- Hmmm...
- It's a deal! Once you think you've reached the pinncacle of boredom... 17,887...17,888...17,889...
- 17,890 arm hairs!
- ...the bar is raised once again. One...two...three... Oops, my pants are on backwards.
- Are you sure it isn't you who's backwards?
- Because frankly, your pants look smarter than you.
- Sir, this is the 12-item express lane and you have 13.
- Come on...it's just one mor eitem. Rules are rules.
- GULP!
- There...twelve.
- GRAB SWISH *BEEP* KA-CHING!
- I didn't know you had a bar code. Just keep pushing. Stay tuned for a recitation of the complete works of Shakespeare.
- Sounds good.
- I lost the remote. We're talking to hog farmer Earl Duroc...
- Tell me, Earl, do they like being buried in the dirt like that?
- Oh yeah, you water 'em and they grow real big. You got him hooked, Earl, now reel him in. The Action Channel presents...
- The Adventures of Mark Veneer...
- Te Crime-Fighting Mime! Writers' strike. And the winner of the ugly baby pageant is...
- Little Roberta Saconski!
- No pictures...PLEEEASE. I doubt if little Roberta will be asked to the prom. We clowns laugh on the outside.
- And cry on the inside.
- How fascinating, Binky. Tell us more. I'm awake on the outside and asleep on the inside. The caterpillar is emerging from the cocoon to become...
- A RARE AMAZONIAN VAMPIRE MOTH!
- NECK! IT'S ON MY NECK! Sometimes you can't improve upon real life. Table for two, please.
- Well, this is a nice blind date. It sure is.
- You're Jon, right? Yes...what is your name again?
- Euphemia. MMMPH!
- Do you find my name amusing? Nope! ...just a little leg cramp...
- That's a funny expression for a leg cramp. I'm...laughing through the pain...EEEEEEE
-
- eeeEUPHEMIA!! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! snort! snort! Didn't even make it past the breadsticks. Would you do me a favor?
- Absolutely!
- Eventually. Probably by accident. But it could happen. Never mind. I gotta dance!
- OW!
- I gotta call an ambulance! My knee! Anything happen around here today?
- Well, aside from you asking me if anything happened around here today...
- Nothing. I am so bored.
- I'm drawing faces on all the pillows!
- And Jon is so lonely. My date insisted that we sit at separate tables at the restaurant.
- She said I look better from a distance.
- Do you think I look better from a distance? No, just more gullible. This isn't real.
- How about that...
- A fake head!
- GARFIELD!
- Present. DID YOU DO THAT?!!
- Hmm...let's see...callous disrespect for personal property...
- ...utter destruction on a scale incomprehensible to the civilized mind...
- And cat ahir everywhere.
- Nope. I'm going to have to get up.
- No, wait.
- I just got my second wind. Time to water the plants.
-
- Subtlety, thy name is NOT Jon. Odie, your tail says you're a noodle-neck stupid head.
- Are you going to take that?
- I wonder why dogs chase their tails. yip! yip! yip! It's a mystery!
- Odie has a girlfriend!
- Please don't let them multiply! I've gotta get out of here!
- There must be someplace to hide!
- Who wants to help me look for cornflakes that look like celebrities? TOO LATE! Have a bowl of rocks, Odie!
- crunch crunch crunch crunch
- crunch crunch crunch crunch That sounds kinda good.
- WHY don't you ever listen to me? Huh?
- WHY don't you ever agree with me? That's not true.
- WHY don't you show me any respect? I do...bonehead.
- WHY don't you ever show affection? Catch me around a mirror sometime.
- WHY do you cause me so much grief? Because I'm a cat.
- And WHY do i still love you anyway? See previous answer. I couldn't decide which shirt to wear...
- So I put all of them on.
- I couldn't decide what to eat, so I ate everything! Where's the refrigerator? What do you want for dinner?
- Who are you talking to?
- I mean, is there anything you don't want? Raisins. Nature holds many dangers.
- Squirrels with miniature weed whackers!
- Especially these days. This is all I'll be shedding today.
-
- I dread tomorrow. I could be on a date now.
- But I choose to just sit here with you.
- The things I do for the women of the world.
-
- Stay in character, Garfield.
- Hello!
- I'm looking for a masseur!
- ...one who can deliver a vigorous teep-tissue massage! Can you recommend anyone?
- WHOMP!
-
- Do you have a card? How are you, Jon?
- I have a headache.
- As if you care. Good to hear. Have a nice day. YAAAAH!
- Okay, Garfield! Stay calm!
- Way ahead of you. AAAAHHH!
- YAAAAAHHH!
- Aren't you curious to know what that was about? Not unless it will cause dinner to be late. I had a pretty good day today.
- Three...two...one...
- Once I got my leg out of that bear trap. Jon never disappoints me. Sometimes I feel like a failure.
- Oh, come on, Jon!
- SOMETIMES?! Boy, the sun sure set early today.
- Burned-out light bulb.
- Okay, so I'm no nature expert.
- Ah, autumn. When mother nature expresses herself.
- Painting from a palette so rich and full.
- The eyes do dance with delight.
- And drink deeply from this, the sweetest season of all.
- VOOOO
- I sincerely doubt that poets penned any loving odes to leaf blowers. Z
- Go back to sleep.
- Z Hey, don't knock it. I've lasted longer than any clock around here. I'm going outside for a while.
-
- Brr...it's cold out there. You were in the refrigerator! Sock puppet impression.
-
- The invisible man! Go away. I'm the world's fastest spider! zip
- SCHWOP
- Okay, okay, second fastest. I am a tiny spider!
- swat
- And this is a tiny magazine! Remember that time I chased you?
- And you fell into a pit full of angry monkeys?
- Now that was funny! This is why none of the great comedians are dogs. . plop!
- Excuse me, mister...
- I'm a poor, defenseless little baby bird who just fell out of his nest...
- Could you help me backup there so I can be with allllllllllll my brothers and sisters again?
-
- Oh, stop with all the disapproving glares already. I am going to follow my dreams, Garfield.
- You don't have any dreams, do you?
- Aside from the dancing monkey in the chocolate fondue pot, no. I was much more acttive than you today.
- I would have been active too...
- If I'd caught MY tie in the blender! ...and that's what I did today!
- How about you?
- I spent the day listening to what you did today. TI carry a picture of you in my wallet. Really?
- I show it to lots of people. All right!
- It gets me lot of sympathy. You snuck up on me with that one! On the farm, we were close to nature, Garfield.
- I remember running bare foot through the cow pasture.
- Boy, that was disgusting. You may stop right here. Is it my imagination, or do you insult me at every opportunity?
-
- That's assuming you HAVE an imagination.
-
-
-
-
- smack smack smack
- All right, I'll turn the furnace on! Run! It's the cat!
- We can't run, you idiot! We're plants!
- I sense fear. Then tip over and roll!
-
- You made lemonade. I gotta start reading instructions.
-
- Took my ball of yarn for a walk. Ah, nature!
-
- Did you forget to pay the nature bill?
- MEOW!
- MEOW! That would bw for me. My foot's asleep.
-
- And dreaming.
- You have that look in your eye...
- That look that says you're going to express mail the dog to a foreign embassy...
- That says you're going to lace my underwear drawer with itching powder...
- That says you're going to perform a horrible practical joke on me while I'm asleep. I know that look.
-
- By the way, have you seen Odie? scratch scratch scratch I gotta get a new look. I'm going to gnaw on the woodwork.
-
- I hope you get a splinter! Filthy vermin!
- Yeah!
- It wouldn't hurt you to take a shower!
- Why aren't you chasing the mouse? The mouse?
- Oh, I didn't recognize him in those glasses. Garfield, what's that noise? Uh...what noise? squeek squeek squeek
- Sounds like mice. I'm babysitting. squeek squeek squeek
- Tell me it's not. They're giving me cheese. squeek squeek squeek Hey!
- Pick it up!
- I almost caught you! Sorry. I guess a house with a fat cat should have a fat mouse, too.
- What are you talking about?
- I am NOT fat! I'm just big boned. Garfield! C'mere!
- Whaddya think? Huh?...Huh?...
- Chicks dig guys with pony tails.
-
- gck gck
- ding dong **
- SHRIEEEK! WAIT!! Amazing how fast they can run in those high heels. It's Socko the Superhero Sock Puppet!
- And his trusty sidekick, Fuzzy Slipper Man!
- There's something wrong with that man. You said it. My life is without meaning!
- BAT
- I take it all back! RIIINNNNNG!
- All right. I'm up. Just doing my job.
- Z You're standing in my food!
- Sorry.
- You only date athletic types?
- Well, Mary, I have good news...
- I'm wearing bowling shoes! CLICK Gutter ball. Are you looking at me? No. I mean, yes.
- I mean, maybe! I mean, if you wanted me to, I was! If you didn't, I wasn't! Help me out here!
- I should've asked her out. Before she started running. Sigh.
- You know, some folks wouldn't see this for what it is.
- Some folks wouldn't understand the astonishing reserves of self-discipline this requires.
- Some folks wouldn't comprehend the intense concentration involved. Some folks wouldn't appreciate the conditioning thet goes into producing muscle memory this advanced.
-
- ARE YOU GOING TO LIE THERE ALL DAY?! Yeeees. It's the old ""fear-of-what-you-don't-understand"" syndrome"". I am not lazy.
- Now, would my conjecture be more credible if I were standing?
- Perhaps, but we never know. Ever wonder about life, Garfield?
- Where we come from...
- Where we're going... Why it takes two hours to deliver a pizza. Sigh...I have no friends.
- HEY, PAL! ZIP
- Wishful thinking. Once upon a time, there was a cat who loved to eat.
- He ate and ate and ate.
- Then he exploded. Is this medically accurate?
-
- Couldn't find a bookmark. I figured that. Christmas is coming soon.
- All together now...1...2...3...
- bip bip boop beep
- How about going out with me tonight, Ellen?
- Well, I thought we'd take the bus down to the mall...
- Have a romantic dinner for two in the food court...
- -and then visit Santa!
-
- You know, Ellen, Santa heard that too. And I bet he's blushing. What do you call that look?
- Eager anticipation.
- I don't know if I can TAKE that for the next 23 days.
-
- Okay, let's go get a tree. You read my mind. Hey, stranger! Long time no see!
- You're looking great! Can I get you anything?
- Some water, maybe? It's not the size of a present that counts, Garfield...
- It's the THOUGHT that counts.
- Think huge. Now back to ""Zorgo...""
- ""The giant radioactive mutant reptile who saved Christmas"". Predictable.
- RAAHHHR! You glow bight enough, you get to guid the sleigh. Boys! Hot chocolate!
- ZIP ZIP
- Where's Odie? I'm standing on him.
-
-
-
-
- Garfield, I gave you that gift wrap tube to PLAY with! And your point? Eggnog?
- Why, thank you!
- Coming up next:
- ""Hairy Larry, the spider who saved chistmas"".
- * You have reached *Santa's Workshop*. If you've been naughty, press 1. If you've been nice, press 2.
- boop
- Yeah, riiiiiiiiiiiight. Dear Santa, this is Garfield.
- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
- How's that? One more ""gimme"" oughta do it. Doing anything special for Christmas, Gandma?
- No...I see.
- Just hanging your peeps ans catching some big air down at the skateboard park, huh? Same ol', same ol'. Ho! Ho! Ho!
-
- Elves.
- Say, cat, could you pick up my mail and watch the place for me?
- -I'm going away for the holidays. Sure thing. Where are you headed?
- I rented a little hole at the south end of the living room, next to the heat register. Sounds cozy.
- Well, I'd better or I'll miss the train...thanks! Happy holida
-
- ...Train? GARFIELD!!
- You think? It couldn't hurt.
-
- Visit Santa ...and a girlfriend, and some chest hair, and a personality, and... Never saw the fat guy fight back tears before. You! ...you, you, you!!
- It's all about YOU; isn't it?!
- What about MY needs?!! Visit Santa I think I'll try another mall. They're in the oven now...
- Should only be about ten minutes. Ten minutes?!
- Do you realize how long that is in ""Christmas cookie"" minutes?!
-
- * Weeeee WISH you a merry Christmas, we WISH you a merry Christmas... *
- Who goes there? EEEK!
- GARFIELD! I WAS JUST GETTING A GLASS OF WATER! Step away from my present, sir. Wha?
- This is a dream and I'm a sugarplum.
- Wanna dance?
-
-
-
-
-
- Three more days, Garfield. Just reserving my place in line. The tree is up, the lights are on, and now it's SNOWING!
- There's only one thing missing...
- BRING IT ON, FAT MAN! Christmas is all about tradition...
- ** DING-DONG
- -and that would be our traditional Christmas eve barbeque pepperoni with double cheese. It's Christmas!
-
- Join me, won't you? Christmas takes forever to arrive...
- And then it's here!
- And then it's gone! Another ""weird cat"" mood swing. Garfield, did you save all the bows like I asked you to?
-
- Okay, so maybe mom is getting a little forgetful.
- It's the thought that counts, right?
- ...right? Come closer and ask that again. BIP BOOP BOOP BRRP
- Ellen, I need a date for new year's eve.
- You've already got a date? Well, can you fix me up with someone?
- No, I 'm not picky. Red flag.
- Yes, I suppose I could rent a plaid tuxedo... Big red flag.
- Yes, I can do all kind of animal impressions... Humongous red flag.
- No, I don't mind her mime troupe chaperoning us... An't a flag big enough OR red enough. Hey, don't be sad...everyone feels the same way.
- Besides, they'll be back next year. sniff
- I miss Christmas cookies. Not until midnight.
- You gotta promise me.
- C'mon, PROMISE! Oh, okay.
-
- Happy new year. Not from where I'M standing. I have no regrets, Garfield.
- Do you have any regrets? A few...
- Beginning with this stupid conversation. Just imagine the amazing things that will happen in the future.
-
- Like will I get the sesame seed from between my teeth? Let's celebrate!
- You're fat.
- Not the excuse I would have picked, but it'll do. At last!
- Here it is, Garfield!
- Our new mega-home entertainment theatre.
- We have digital high definition, wide-screen, CD, VHS, DVD, CD-ROM, surround sound...
- ...and then there's the best part...
- Five, count 'em, five remotes! We can share! In the long run, I think bad luck and good luck even out.
- THUD
- I missed the chair. You're going to have to get on a really, really, REALLY long run of good lick to catch up, pal. Going somewhere?
- Uh-huh. And unfortunately for you, this is it. CRASH!
- What was that? The new paperboy.
- He has quite an arm.
-
- If you average them out, they're normal. Well, Cindy, I am a literally kind of guy.
- Actually, I'm writing my memoir.
- I'm up to my thumb-sucking years. That's three chapters. Any requests?
-
- Yeah! Hold still!
- Jon, Jon Arbuckle!
- Don't you remember me? Uh...no!
- It's me...Bertha!
- I've lost 200 pounds! Wow.
- Well, gotta go! Good to see you. Yeah...you too.
- Wow. I can't believe she would let herself go like that. Is it my turn to decide what we do today?
- Yes.
- But it's my turn to say I don't want to do it. The best things in life are free!
-
- How much would the SECOND-best things cost? You're in medium-sized trouble, mister!
- Rats.
- That was hardly worth the effort. It's one of those restless nights.
- When the weight of the world comes down on you.
- Like what if the refrigerator explodes? You're getting fatter.
- I am?
- Whew! I thought the world was shrinking! I have disdain for you.
-
- Unless ""disdain"" means something good. Sigh...
- ...so I took her to this fancy restaurant and everything was going fine...when I missed my mouth and stuffed a breadstick up my nose.
- My date laughed an inhaled an olive. I jumped up to help her, not realizing that I had tucked the tablecloth into my pants.
- Well, that knocked the candle over, setting the tablecloth on fire.
- So I go running through the restaurant trailing a blazing tablecloth when the sprinkler system goes off.
- Now, everybody starts screaming and diving out windows, and my date...well...
- Do you know what a really wet, really mad sheep dog looks like? First dates are always so awkward. This sandwich tastes funny.
- You think YOU have problems...
- I have peanut butter between my toes. There's something happening.
- I finally got the wildfire in my sock drawer under control!
- Out of the ordinary, I mean. Don't bother me.
- I said, don't bother me!
- You just insist on existing, don't you?! Check it out, Garfield.
- A tie is the crowning touch to any ensemble.
- And if you happen to have on that lights up...
- You'll be an easier target. I am really striking out, Garfield.
- Even ""Gap-Toothed Gretta,"" the distance-spitting queen, shot me down. Too bad.
- She actually sounds like a fun date. I'm back from damaging the neighborhood!
- I just got off the phone.
- Wonderful! Saves me from having to fill you in on all the details. Garfield, check this out.
- I bet not even YOU could be this relaxed.
-
-
-
-
- OK, I'm humbled. Don't mess with the master. You are the pet, I am the master.
- The most important thing in your life is your master's voice.
- Are you listening? Sorry, I was thinking about cereal. Where's your smile, friend?
-
- I must have left it on my other face. Jon, do we have a toothpick?
- I have bread and ham stuck between my teeht...
- ...on second thought, do we have any cheese? Greetings...I am an alien life form bent on world domination.
- Why are you in the refrigerator?
- I used to be a meat loaf. JON! That's it. No date.
- I tried every woman I know. He did, too.
- And even some I don't. Boy, were THEY surprised. I'm not going to share this cookie with you.
- GRAB
- I could've told you that.
- Arbuckle Famils Reunion Z Jon, give your ol' aunt Trudy a kiss! Doc Boy, a pig? Were you raised in a barn?!! ...is that a trick question? ...what's that in your eyebrow?
- ---how did you get rid of your bunion? ...a weed whacker. ...uncle Roy, have you seen my contact lens?
- ...I brought photos of our trip to see the world's biggest hairball. ...do these pants make my hips look big? Urp.. ...it's not the pants, dear.
- ...then the chicken exploded! ...corn'll give'm gas, alright. ...isn't this nice? So far, no brawls, no calls, and no falls. It's kinda like dinner theater, isn't it?
- How's that herbal tea?
- IT'S NOT COFFEE, THAT'S HOW IT IS! Awww. Rough day, Jon?
- Cheer up, Jon!
- Was I supposed to say that? At least YOU care. RIIING
- May I speak the the head of the household?
- Speaking. Give me that! You can be replaced.
- ALL RIGHT!
- That was an insult. How soon can we have someone here? Garfield, I can read your mind.
- You're thinking, ""why doesn't Jon feed me?"" ...right? Close.
- Actually, it was, ""why doesn't dork boy feed me?"" It's an amazing world we live in.
- They can put a man on the moon...
- Yet they can't make a computer that bounces. What was that crash?
- JON ARBUCKLE Man of Action
- ...member of the International Hall of Hunkhood...
- ...poster boy for testosterone... BONK THUD! POW! SOK DUCH BAM!
- Able to tame the wildest hearts!
- YAAAHHH!
- Another one of those ""how-did-my-life-wind-up-like-this"" dreams? I've instututed my first tine.saving measure, Garfield.
- Are you ready for this? ...as I'll ever be.
- One button! It would be cruel to tell him about pullovers. Sad, lonely or sick...
- If I had to choose one...
- I'd pick lonely. Is that a shot? This day is gone, Garfield. I thought It would never leave.
- We can't relive it. Relive ""boring""?
- It's gone forever. Lock the door in case it wants to come back. You are INSOLENT!
- Why thank you!
- Another adjective to add to my resume. People seek me out for financial advice.
-
- Did you take my wallet?! I want a lawyer. Jon sys we don't have to go out to have fun.
- Jon says everything we need is right here.
- Jon says is't fun-with-hair-gel day. YAWN...
- Good morning. It's sunday, and you know what that means...
- A humongous newspaper with COLOR funnies...
- And...and...
- Aaand...
- And that's all.
- But that's enough! I am the ghost of hamburgers past here to show you the error of your ways!
- GULP!
- Needed more of the ghost of ketchup past. Paper, mister?
-
- I wonder what the headline was. ""Cat Shreds Newspaper"" There are some questions in life I'll never know the answers to...
- Like, ""what's the capital of North Dakota?""
- I can never at that one. I think setting goals is very important.
- Good idea.
- Without a goal, how would you know when you failed? See the bunny slipper, Garfield?
- The bunny is sad because he can't find his friend.
- Do you know where his friend is? It's just a hunch, but you might check the garbage disposal. Garfield, where's the canary, and what's that on the floor around you?
-
- I'm shedding feathers! I'm shedding feathers!
-
-
-
-
-
- Boogie break. Disco dork. With my new journal, I can keep track of all the exciting things that happen to me!
- Darn. Darn. Darn. Darn. Darn. Darn.
- Darn. Darn. Darn. Day one: Every pen in the house ran out of ink. Walking is good for you, Garfield.
-
- But...what do I know... I didn't know knees could bend that way. I'm going to spend the evening trying out different kinds of shampoo!
-
- And one kind of furniture polish. I wonder if Jon has food I can steal.
- I have some food you can steal!
- So much for the thrill of the hunt. You should get closer to nature. Okay.
-
- Sitting next to a plastic fern doesn't count. I have much to learn. It's fun time!
-
- Unless my watch is fast.
- Garfield, I got us a bicycle.
- And check out my biking attire. Some call it attire. I call it underwear.
- We're going get oohs and aahs! And tee hees and ha has.
- DING DING DING DING DING
- Hello, ladies! DING DING Good-bye, dignity! Invisible Wall Ahead
-
- SMACK Beware of The Dog!
- He Bites Really Hard!
- However, He Can be Bribed. Translation: always carry meat. Beware of The Vicious Dog
- Well?
- The sign is a work of fiction. Any resemblance between it and me is purely coincidental. Beware of The Guard Dog
- RRRR What are you guarding?
- The sign. Ah. I chased my tail yesterday. Yes?
- And caught it. Good for you.
- And buried it. That's a little more information than I needed. I sniffed things in the front yard, and then I chased my tail.
- Later, I'm going to go sniff things in the BACKyard!
- The dog version of vital. Got a minute, Garfield?
- Garfield, I'm so stressed out.
- The yard needs mowing.
- And the car needs an oil change.
- The house needs painting.
- But, at least I have you to comfort me.
- My litter box needs cleaning. Hard work is its own reward!
-
- Okay, okay! Gimme the punch line! I'm thinking of burping.
- Burp
- I burped. You don't have lot going on, do you, Garfield? I'm going to spend the day doing nothing.
-
- Cough. Amateur. I'm i a rut, Garfield.
- I should travel...see the world.
- Pack my bags, put you in a kennel and take off! Excuse me?! No one returns my calls, Garfield.
- Either I've alienated everyone I know...
- Or weevils have chewed through the phone lines! Ho, Jon. You've alineated the weevils, too.
-
- We could use more furniture. I think one chair is plenty. ** DING DONG
- ** DING DONG Garfield, I'm getting a one-hour, in-home massage!
- Guten Tag. I am Helmut, your masseur. My, what big...knuckles you have.
- I set up a table here. You lie down, relax, und vee begin.
- CRACK
- Was that ME? Ja.
- AAAAGGGHHHHH Only 59 minutes and 45 seconds to go. Who wants to say something nice about me?
- You're fat.
- Next? I'm trying to decide which would be more exercise.
- Running around the block...
- Or running around you. How about running FROM me, smart guy? You can't see your feet, can you?
- How do you know you're not wearing ballerina slippers?
- I hate it when he plants these doubts. Or golf shoes? You're as light as a feather!
- Of course, I'm talking about the world's heaviest feather, you fat disgusting pig!
- I gotta work on leaving the room faster. Hmm...
- Maybe if I stood backwards on it...
- uoY era taf. You were fat yesterday, you're fat today, and you'll be fat tomorrow.
- Garfield, you'll be fat till the day you die!
- Darn. He gave away the ending.
- z z z

- z z z clop clop
- clop clop
- Die time. Couldn't we just get carpet? clop clop Time to lose some weight.
- Nobody's home...
- And it's crowded in here. I like to visualize these rice cakes as a juicy steak dinner.
- I don't have your imagination.
- So I have to visualize this juicy steak dinner as a juicy steak dinner! I wonder how Garfield is doing on his diet?
- If 11 donuts stick together it counts as one, right?
- I wonder a lot of things. Halt!
- Are you cheating on your diet?
- What's in here? That would be Skippy, my, ug...pet quirrel. How's the diet going?
- It's going.
- ...going, gone!
- I wonder what Odie's thinking?
- GULP
-
- shake shake shake
- BOOT!
- Oh, he's probably thinking fond thoughts of moi. The news around the world isn'T all bad.
-
- I guess you can't be anywhere. Hey! You have something stuck between your teeth, Garfield. Where?
- Right between your front ones. What is it?
- It's the refrigerator. Do we have any really big floss? I'm going out, Garfield.
- Don't get into any trouble.
- At least nothing that involves a swat team. Then don't be long. It's quiet around here.
- Want me to break something?
- I'm not complaining, mind you. Want me to break something quietly? I have the feeling I'm going to have a good day.
- Thought you could lock me out, didn't you?
- I had to throw the birdbath through the picture window, and then pull up the mailbox to lean against the... That feeling is fading.
- I can't think of anything to say. Darn it, Jon!
- Then how am I supposed to ignore you?!
- Yo! Yo! Yo! Garfield, what it is?
- Just chillin' in the crib, homey?
- I'm letting chicks know that I'm da bomb.
- I'm gonna scope the park wit' my bad self.
- Whoa!
- THUD!
- Tru dat. There's just no pleasing you, is there?!
-
- Okay, once more, but this time with a little bit more emotion. HA! HA! HAW! HAW! HAW!
- CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!
- Quit tickling the milkman! This house needs fixing.
- I'll need some of those little pointy things... Nails?
- And one of those poundy things. Stop him. Odie swallowed my golf ball!
-
- I'll play as it lies. Get back here. I can't decide whether to stay here...
- Or go someplace else.
- Compromise. This is one of those squirting flowers.
- This is one of those clawing paws.
- Can you say ""detente""?
- It's a beautiful day, boys.
- Everyone's out with their pets.
- Celebrating their shared lives.
- Showing their affection for one another. Oh no...
- Oh, the joyous union of human and animal! Her eit comes...
- Group hug! My goal is to be a little less pathetic, Garfield. No! No! You can't do that, Jon!
- Think about your fans!
- You've set a standard to which losers everywhere aspire! Garfield, would you say I'm suave?
- Yes, I would.
- If you coated my body with honey and staked me down to an anthill. Debonair, even? Garfield, I'm starting a garden!
- Tilling the soil...nurturing seed.
- And did I mention I'm wearing overalls? I knew there was an ulterior motive. bip bip boop
- Hi, it's jus Jon calling to say hi... ...hi!
- Hey, let's go home and check my answering machine! Pity him. Chicks dig intellectual guys, soooooo...
- ZZZZZZZZZZ
- This makes my forehead look larger! Ah, the old ""big brain"" ploy. I sometimes feel like a failure at life.
-
- I was hoping for a little sympathy. That's another thing you've failed at. Z
- Z
- Z
- Z
- **Z**
-
- Slacker!
- Why are you just sitting there?!
- There's napping to be done, man! Go waway. YAWN Is that all you have to do?
- Noooo...
- YAWN scratch scratch I don't want to be disturbed while I sleep.
-
- Or after I wake up, for that matter. Let's play a game, Garfield.
- Let's pretend you're vital.
- Let's pretend you're useful. Let's pretend gravity is great today.
- Breathe, Garfield. GASP!
- Lazy! I would have, eventually. I'm going to throw out everything moldy I can find.
- I hope you're cleaning out the refrigerator.
- Because if you're not, this is dandruff, not mold.
- Who wants to feed me?
-
- Who wants to fix food for the hungry kitty?
-
- Who wants to keep their lips? Is it dinner time already?
- You don't have to have the answers if you ask the right questions. I am now officially bored.
- Officially?
- I have a certificate. Cool!
- YAWN
- Was that necessary? Have you ever spent any time with yourself? You look bored.
- I'm not, really.
- This is just force of habit. Is that how you're going to spend your day?
- My day, my week, my month...
- You're pathetic. My year, my decade, and my century. Can I tell you something, Garfield? Something very personal...
- Something of great importance...
- I guess not. My date had a great time tonight!
-
- I suspect. A no-show, huh?
- How can you just LIE here like that?!
-
-
- Simple.
-
- Like this. You don't scare me. I'm not trying to.
- Good, because you don't. Like I care.
- Oh, the bitter struggle between cat and dog. You know what I hate?
- War? Pestilence? Poverty? Injustice?
- Humidity. Me too! Life...this is it, Garfield.
- This is all there is.
- No dessert? I'm finished running. Me too.
- Well...
- Finished. Didn't start. Whatever. Wow. What a beautiful sunset.
- What could be more beautiful than that?
- I'm going to say tuna salad. YAWN!
- Uh-oh. My mouth is stuck open!
- Help me! Or throw some food in! Preferably the latter.
- bzzzzzz Hey, look...a cat. bzzzzzzzzz So it is.
- bzzzzzzz Let's buzz around his head a few hundred times. bzzzzz Cool!
- zzzzzz zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzz
- You don't suppose he finds this annoying, do you? Nah, everybody loves flies.
- SMACK!
- SMACK!
- ""Eeevreybody loves flies!""
- Okay, not everybody. We have with us this morning the inventor of decaffeinated coffee.
- Sir, what inspired you? Z
- Sir?... Sir?... Z I'll drink to that. We have with us the inventor of the tape recorder.
- Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir.

- Your name, sir? Cy. Cy Clops.
- GET HIM OUTTA HERE! Hey, I'll keep an eye out for ya! Hol don! That's a rubber eye! The following is a rerun...
- And just why are we rerunning it?
- Because NOBODY watched it the first time! I'll watch! Our first guest tonight is a man who can't say no...
- Are you married, sir? No.
- Oops! Dang!
- Our next guest... Fame is fleeting.
-
-
-
-
-
- Throw rugs have it good. Z
- You woke up with a smile! I know...
- Help me!
-
- Are you gonna finish that? GARFIELD! The stupid...
-
- You have to admire their consistency. Odie is missing and the vacuum cleaner is barking.
- And do you know WHY?
- Because *I* sure don't. Whew! That hamburger had better be right THERE when I get back!
-
- GARFIELD! Problem? GULP!
- Ha! I FOOLEd you! That was a fake WAX hamburger!
- Well, stick a wick in my navel and make a wish. pick pick Sigh...
- I need a date.
- I really, REALLY need a date.
- My soul aches for the mere presence of a woman in my general vicinity...
- My lonliness knows no bounds! My longing for companionship is unrivaled in the annals of human existence! ...so, how about it?
-
- Telephones don't care. Not even a pity ring. What a beautiful, sunny day!
-
- We need heavier drapes. I know that look. Feed me.
- You want to be brushed, right?
- Or perhaps not. Feeeed meeeee I wish I could know what you're thinking...
-
- Is it ""feed me""? Hel-LOOO, DR DOOLITTLE! I know that look.
- It's you ""Who, me?!"" look.
- This means you've done something awful. Who, me? I know that look...it's your ""I ate your goldfish"" look.
- Burrrrrrrrrp
- Wow, you're good. I know that look.
- That's your argumentative look.
- Sez who, beetle brain?
- Yup...
- There's a great big beautiful world out there.
-
-
- SLAM!
- I prefer my little ugly world in here. You're pathetic! Garfield, I wonder what TRUE happiness is...
- CLONK
- Fill it up or I'll show you what it ain't. Let's play a game...
- You completely and utterly ignore me...
- And I'll sit here and pout.
- I sense that this is heading somewhere. The washing machine keeps spitting out my dirty sweat socks.
-
- Can it do that? I know *I* would.
-
- Bath day. I'm tired of thinking deep thoughts, Garfield.
-
- Can nose hairs get dandruff? Ahh..back to the shallow end of the thinking pool. I'm making dancing fingers.
- Now I'm not.
- Now I'm wiggling my toes. Oh, to be less informed.
- I've gotta put a stop to this ""aging"" thing...
- I wonder if I walked backwards if I could reverse the process...
-
- FUMP
-
- Yeah...THAT took a few years off my life... I have another birthday coming soon.
-
- Oh, it's not invited, but it always drops in anyway. 25 years on this planet, and what have I accomplished?
- AB-SO-LUTELY NOTHING!
- What's with the smug grin? Please...modesty forbids. 25, huh? To what do you attribute your longevity?
-
- Ah. Soon I'll be turning 25...wow.
- The things I've seen...the things I've done...
- Well, the things I've seen, anyway. 25 years...
- A lot has happened in this world since I was born...
- -not that I had a HAND in any of it, mind you. I'm gonna be 25 years old...man, where did the time go?
- Is the fridge still this way? Yeah, help yourself.
- Thanks...me.
- Excuse me...do I know you? You should.
- I was you back in 1978.
- Cool! So I'm the new, improved you! ""New"", yes, but ""improved"" is a matter of opinion.
- In my opinion, then, yes. However, your opinion is my opinion, and mine, yours; meaning uh, that our opinion is, uh...not...uhhhh...
-
- So, I was you, huh? A long time ago.
- How did I see out of those itty-bitty eyes?
- First explain how you stand on those two spindly legs. This is fascinating!
- I'm watching myself eat!
- One of my favorite pastimes is now my favorite spectator sport! Shall we retire to the kitchen? Splendid idea.
- ...age before beauty. Excuse me?
- Who's the one turning 25 here? Har har har Today is my 25th birthday and I want to thank you for reading me.
- I'm not talking about the other readers, I'm talking to YOU. Thank YOU!
- From all of us! Things were so much better back in 1978.
- Better than 200 channels? Twoooo huhhh... huuuh...
- I'M NOT WORTHY! Wanna see the picture-in-picture? I hear a lot has happened since 1978. Like what?
- I hear disco died.
- Not i THIS house.
- Are you bored? I am.
- At least I think I am.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am.
- ...or am I?
- Hmmmmmm...I gues Iam.
- You? Nope. Indecision fascinates me. Play time! No, thanks.
- Play time! You try too hard.
- Sigh.
- Don't start.
- You don't bat me anymore. How'd you like another dryer ride? Fine! I don't need you! ...I can have fun all by myself!
-
- Whee! You're pathetic. Dad was a tube sock...
- Mom was a scarf...
- And poor sis neve rmade it off the sheep. Darn that wolf. Stop following me! But I want to play!
- Jon, would you just look at this?!
- What is it, Garfield? Why are there never any witnesses? Hi, Garfield. Jon, this ball of yarn is obsessed!
- What's going on? It has a mad crush on me, and won't leave me alone!
- Say, why don't you play with that ball of yarn, there? Will you LISTEN to the man?! Ahhhh...
- I love grass.
- In the morning it's wet and cool...
- In the afternoon it's warm and soft...
- And at night it's the perfect cushion for stargazing.
-
- What a smile. What a lawn. I firmly believe you were put here to punish me.
- Not only that...
- I was put here to punish dogs, too. Odie? ...fancy white albacore, packed in spring water. sniff sniff
- Excellent! Very good, sir!
- Every cat should have his own tuna steward. Cream? Of course.
- Sugar? Pil eit on!
- Coffee? Just a splash. Thursdays are too far from the start of the week, and not close enough to the end.
- Thursdays just lie there.

- I'd like to see you exercise sometime. You should see me sleep sometime. Women just don't seem to notice me, Garfield.
- Maybe I seem unapproachable...intimidating...
- That's IT! Jon Arbuckle: Man of Mystery! The Ego is a wonderfully resilient thing. Know why chicks dig me, Garfield?
- Because I know what drives 'em wild.
- Good oral hygiene. We're so lonely. Ellen says I remind her of a comic-book hereo.
- Which one, Ellen? ""Lazer Man""?
- ""The Adventures of Clown Boy""? Who, disguised as mild-mannered geek, Jon Arbuckle... I don't know about this dating thing, Garfield.
- I'm beginning to get a little discouraged.
- I mean, I'm almost up to the ""X's"". Hey, there's always the yellow pages. Beth, PLEASE go out with me!
- I PROMISE I won't embarrass you...
- ...like I did on our last date. *I* thought the twirling bow tie was a stitch. I finally got a date with Beth!
- It's three years from next thursday.
- Her calendar was kind of full. And your head is kind of empty.
-
- BOOT!

- Is this true?

- I like this game...what am I now? I swear I didn't eat your hamburger!
- It was...uh...Clive! Do you really exprect me to believe that ""invisible friend! stuff?!

- It's for you, uncle Earl. There's one in every family. I'm not sleepy at all.
- Or hungry.

- SMASH!
- Still to loud. Rats. There's old uncle Ed...
- He had false teeth, a glass eye, a wooden leg, and a hock for a hand.
- He was a blast at family reunions. That was my guess. Hey, look! My old high-shool gym shorts!
- Mom always sewed name tags into all my gym clothes...
- I see also sewed ""front"" and ""back"" tags in them, too. What? Hey, mom sent me a box full of my baby teeth!
- I lost them all on the same day, you know.
- Darn ol' tree. I wonder what's on TV? Mom sent me an old blanket.
- That's funny. I never had a special blanket when I was a ki
- RIIING
- Don't get emotional, Doc Boy. I'll send it back right away. Yes, Doc Boy... Sigh. Look, mom sent me some drawings I did when I was little!
- That's a chicken.
- You're holding it upside down. It's supposed to look alive? Here's another drawing I did when I was little.
- It's a cow.
- See where it says ""cow"" next to that little arrow pointig to it? Clever use of symbolism. Geez, look at me...
- I'm getting old.
- My cheeksa re puffy, my face is sagging...
- Look at the bags under my eyes.
- Wrinkles, too...and I'm getting a gut.
- What do you think I should do, Garfield?
- I think you should close the drapes. EEEK! I just ate an entire meal...
- ...and you didn't steal any of it.
- Happy birthday! I'm in a nostalgia mood.
- BURP
- Aaah...lunch! Garfield, you can be very destructive.
- I can?
- I wasn't giving you permission! Too late! I already broke something! I am drawing ever closer to inner peace.
-
- That's my new name for a nap. Tell me, Maureen, do you hate me more than you used to?
- The same?
- I call that progress! You da man! don't believe it!
- Garfield only ate half of his food!
- I took a break for a snack. Oh.
-
- You know, I'm a do-nothin' kinda guy.
- But, I do nothin' very well.
- I fact, I'm the dean of do-nothin'!
- A LEAN, MEAN, DO-NOTHIN' MACHINE!
- How you doing? Feeling vital, thank you! Dark shirt.
- Cat.
- Tah daaah. I', going to vacuum this cat hair off the rug.
- Think, Jon!
- If you left the cat hair, we wouldn't NEED a rug! Sometimes it's good to count your blessings.
- Cat hair is NOT a blessing.
- Well, it comes in handy if you're a cat. A cat hair!
- I thought you were DONE shedding! So did I.
- Ah, it's the spare. If I see ONE more cat hair around here, I'm going to LOSE it.
- poink
- YAAAAHH! Definitely worth the price of admission. My life has no meaning.
- You know...when you don't move, you shed less.
- What was I thinking?
- ?

- Open your mouth, dummy.
- There it is, dummy.

- That was very affectionate, Garfield. I had peanut butter on my hands. My sock puppet is in the wash.
-
- Sydney shoe just isn't the same. My foot is cold. I've been all over the world!
- Which is no big deal...
- I can see the edge of it from here. Ah...
- What a beautiful day!
- It's raining. Not in the kitchen.
-
-
- Well, look at you!
- That's quite a smile!
- It's nice to see you in a good mood for a change.
- I SAT ON A MOUSETRAP. As time passes, you get fatter and fatter.
- Ah yes, the age-old dilemma, Jon.
- How to stop time. Sniff...it's lonely being a scale.
- Nobody listens to me. I'll listen.
- You're about eleven pounds shy of a big rig! I walked right into that one. You're fat. Fat?
- Really fat... Really fat?
- Really, really fat. Oh! Really, really fat. I knew that.
- Wow! Congratulations! On what?
- You are now officially prohibited from crossing some bridges. You're fat.
-
- How about now? You may LOOK smaller, but you're still fat! Just once I'd like to hear something nice form you.
- Oh, how wonderful it would be to soar through the sky like an eagle, so proud and free.
- I mean about me. You'd never get off the ground.
- Hey, pal! Hey, hallucination.
- Wait a minute!
- What are you doing here? I only see you when I'm on a diet.
- Well, SURPRISE!
- I just heard your owner on the phone with the vet, and you're going on one now! I am not!
- I'll vouch for him. Oh, no! Pizzas NEVER lie! SLAP
-
- Been climbing trees? I know, diet time. You may have an entire grape for a snack!
-
- HOW ABOUT A DROP OF WATER TO WASH IT DOWN?!
-
- I'm only having ONE meatball. I like celery. Oh, me too!
- That's why I've dressed this stalk up in its own little outfit!
- You're supposed to eat it. CANNIBAL! ""Cheeesecaaake"".
- I was right! What?
- You just gained a pund. I'm off my diet.
- I'm on my diet.
- I'm off my diet. BURP

- Any suggestions? Do what I do. Close your eyes. I'm off on a long journey!
-
- Ran out of table. Someday, tree, when you grow big enough, I might climb you!

- Whee.
- We're having some fun now.
- Oh, when will the fun ever end? Hello there, ol' pal, ol' buddy, ol' pal!

- And Jon!
- All right!
- When it freezes over, we can go skating. We were out of chocolate chips, so I used bacon bits.

- Hey! Where's my big greeting?
-
- SLURP!! Oh, there it is. Pay attention to me, world!
-
- Maybe the world is over here. There's a great big wonderful world out there!
-
- I hope it doesn't collide with this one! ...and then...uh...I forget what happened. Oh, great!
- YOU TOLD ME A STORY FOR AN HOUR AND FORGOT THE ENDING?!
- If I had been paying attention, I would really be upset!
-
- Would this be a bad time to ask you to help get this piece of sofa off my claws? Let's see...
- YAHOO!
- Buy new curtains. Whoa...
- That's amazing!
- I fell of my chair. So you didn't suddenly become invisible?

- I feel kinda bad about turning off the water main. GAAAAHHHH twist twist twist twist twist twist That book can't be more interesting than me.
- What's new with you, Garfield?
- That's none of your business. BARK BARK BARK BARK
- Are you even listening to me? Yes, I am...
- You were saying something about smelling bad, having fleas, and being ugly. Life is complicated...
- You're born. You eat. You sleep. You croak.
- ...for some of us. Ahem
- WOOF !
- Have you been lifting weights? I caught the mouse!
- Then guess what happened?
- Hey, who's telling this story? Well excuuuse me! It's Jon!
- I'm out of food.
- Can we get a different Jon in here? snap snap
- Hmmm.
- If I eat Jon's bagel, he'll be angry with me.
- But if I don't, I'LL be angry with me...
- What should I do?
-
- You ate my bagel! But I'm pleased with myself. Cats are dangerous!
- YAWN
- Or so I've heard. scratch scratch scratch YAWN
- BURP scratch scratch scratch
- You're a bad influence on the vermin. Hey! Did you spit out your gum, Garfield?
- Nope.
- I put it in your sandwich until after lunch. WHEW!
- Your tuna breath could peel the paint off the walls!
- What do you mean, ""could""? Killer Sock Puppet! Get Back!
- You have to sleep sometime. My hand is ever alert.
- If you could ever get a date, we wouldn't have to play these dumb games. Wanna go get a pizza? Man, am I sleepy!
- I 'm so sleepy I couldn't sleep!
- With you, it's just one novel idea after another, isn't it?
- Z My foot's asleep.
- Z No, I'm not.
- Z I wasn't talking about yo.
- Z Oh sure, talk about your right foot. You've always liked him better!
- Will you shut up?! I'm trying to sleep! Hey! Don't make me separate you two!
- Z What am I saying? WAAH! The future lies before us!
-
- Or is that the past? Hard to tell them apart. What if we could see into the future, Garfield?
- Even just five years into the future...what would we see?
- Probably this, and hopefully with a fresher pot of coffee. Care to join me, Garfield? I'm contemplating life.
- WHOA!
- Sound like you have it covered. OH NOOO! Today's the day...
- The day you're all allowed to eat without any guilt whatsoever.
- WELCOME TO MY WORLD!!! Here's your shopping list, Jon.
- That won't fit in the car.
- ""A...bigger...car"".
- BAT
- I'm having the time of my life! Trading places was a bad idea.
-
-
-
-
-
-
- CHRISTMAS IS COMING!
- SHOPPING! CARDS! WRAPPING! RELATIVES!
- Panicked yet? Christmas is coming! Have you been good?
- Me neither.
- Let this be our little secret. Have you thought about what you want for Christmas, Garfield?
-
- YOU THINK TOO MUCH! ...we now return to our holiday special...
- ""The Christmas that almost wasn't"". Saw it.
- Rudolph gets a runny nose. I really should get around to baking some Christmas cookies.
-
- If I know what's good for me. You're stealing my lines again. Wanna share a candy cane?
-
- That's not sharing! I'll save you the stripe.
-
- I love Christmas.
-
-
- I love Christmas.
- I'm a carrier. You got a Christmas card from our neighbor, Mrs. Feeny.
- She says she hopes you get coal in your stocking...
- A big ol' hot, fiery coal. Yeah, yeah. I love her, too. Welcome back.
- We now return to ""Murray Needleman...""
- ""The roadside assistance specialist who saved Christmas!"" So THAT'S how you tow a reindeer. I remember Christmas back on the farm... Uh-oh.
- The family, the food, the caroling... Here we go.
- ...decorating thr goat... -and there we went. Yes...I see, thank you, goodbye.
- That was the mall.
- You are no longer welcome at ""Santa's Happy Hollow"". Fink elves. Yes, I went shopping.
- And yes, I bought your Christmas present.
- And yes, I hid it. Then the game's afoot! I'm heavily into tradition this holiday season.
- -EVERY... -COOKIE ...GONE!!
- -AGAIN!!! As I was saying...
-
-
-
-
-
- Pick a spot and LEAVE it there! Have you no sense of aesthetics?! Hallo?... Hi, Grandma! Happy holidays!
- Here? ...oh, cold, blowing and snowing...you?
- It's 88 in Cancun. Yeah, but with the wind chill, it's 87. Look, Garfield, a card from Doc Boy!
- ""Happy anniversary, my dearest, on this our wedding day. Love, Doc Boy.""
- What does it mean? It means the feed and grain store was out of Christmas cards. When it comes to wrapping presents, nobody's faster than me!
-
- I said, I was fast, not neat. I picked up on that. I never received a Christmas card from you, Ellen.
- It must have gotten lost in the mail.
- Lost mail isn't THAT funny, Ellen. Don't get me wrong...it's not that I don't like Christmas.
- I LOVE Christmas...
- But what's with this ""once a year"" thing?! Sigh.
- Christmas never comes soon enough.
- The best holidays always arrive fashionably late.
- * RIIING
- Hello?
- Yes, he's here.
- Who's calling?
-
- You PAGED Santa?!! Hey, his E-Mail server has been down all morning. ?
- sniff sniff sniff sniff
-
-
- It's Christmas eve...presents are wrapped, carols are sung, and Santa's snack is out and waiting.
- There's only one thing left to do...
- -not be able to fall asleep all night. Ahem...
- A on, and a two, and a...
- MERRY CHRISTMAS! Oh, no!
- Christmas is gone!
- DID I SAY YOU COULD LEAVE?! Denise, I need a date for new year's...I'm begging you...I'll do anything.
-
- Um. I don't think I can locate a chicken suit and a camera crew on such short notice. Don't think he won't try, though.
- You know what I like about bowling, boys?
- It's a great way to meet girls!
- KA-BANG
- THUMP THUMP OUCH THUMP
- OOF! EEK! THUMP
- And their angry boyfriends. Whoa.
- I put on a few pounds over the holidays. Hey! Hey!
- No one likes a braggart, pal. Do you know what would be fun?
- Jon, pay careful attention...
- If I did, would I be standing here?
-
- You want to wear the hat for a while? I don't think I could do it justice. Who knows what the future holds? Less of this, I hope.
- Maybe medical science will make major advances.
- Like curing those little floaty specks at the edge of our vision. And the big one in the middle of mine. What ever happened to my glory days, Garfield?
- Wait! Wait! I know!
- KER-FLUSH Good times are ahead.
- Or behind.
- Because they sure aren't there.
- You know, boys, I was thinking...
- What would life be like if cats and dogs wer ein charge?
- Hmmm...interesting.
- I'll have to give this some thought.
- Get us something to eat, clean my litter box, give Odie his bath, and I'll get back to you. Z
- blink blink
- Why can't the sun have a snooze button? Do not hit me in the face with that pie!
- You're the boss.
- Pie down the pants! SPLAT! I am not pathetic!
-
- Am I? Jon, you're asking a cat's opinion.
- PLOP
- Stand here. Maybe we'll go out to eat tonight.
-
- But not to the pet shop for canaries and goldfish. Can we drop by on the way home for dessert? My date excused herself from the table...
- And never came back! Excuse me, Jon...
- Maybe she got locked in the ladies' room. ...while I step into the closet and laugh for awhile. Sigh...
- Garfield, I gotta do something with my life. Why start now?
- I don't know what to do. DO what I do.
- I guess I'll raise my standards. I've lowered my standards.
- I'll be tougher on myself! Now I'm easier on myself.
- I'll take on the world! I got out of bed this morning.
- Who am I kidding? How do I do it? Aaaaah!
- He's drinking my hot tub!
- How's the soup? What.... Cheese!
-
- And crackers! Now you're talking! We took a vote, and we've decided to allow you to stay in the house. All right! cool!
- Right?
- Lucky for you! Help! I am frightened of that big strong cat!
-
- Help! I am frightened of that big strong cat! What? What are you doing in there?
- The same thing you are.
- I pity you. Ditto the pity, pal. You're trapped!
- Yeah, trapped in here with the chocolate chip cookies.
- I wish I were trapped. You'd need a bigger hole.
- Hi, Odie!
- Great to see you!
- But now, sadly, our visit must end.
- Oh, the pain of it all!
- BOOT!
- Literally. CRASH! Do you know what I think? I certainly hope not.
- Sigh.
- I think my toes are jealous of my fingers because they get to point at things.
- Note to self: stop walking around the house! I fell down sixty-three times, but I still like them.
- THUD
- Sixty-four! Ladies and gentlemen, the inventor of banana-peel slippers! I don't care what anybody else thinks!
-
- How's that sound? Needs work. This has been a long, long day.
- This day is really zipping by.
- Could I borrow a cup of your day? Garfield! It ISN'T time to get up!
- THEN WHY YELL AT ME?!
- That works. Rats. Ahem.
- HURK!
- HOOOOK
- NYAAAARK
- HOURRRK
- HAAACK
- Can you and your hairball take it outside? What, and give up show business? Entertain me. Sorry, pal.
- This is what I do. Not even alittle time step?
-
- And just where do you think you're going? Who, me? You never take me anywhere.
- BAT
- Wow! This must be the floor I've heard so much about! BAT
- Yee-HA! It must be true...
- PARTEE! REverything is relative.
-
- You've really let yourself go. Ha ha ha. If you had ome wish, what would it be?
- To be part of the biggest sweater in the world! Who would it be for?
- You, lard-bottom. Walked smack into that one.
-
-
-
-
-
- I'm on the ""I have pets"" diet. You never know what a cat is thinking.
- That's right. We're very mysterious.
- Eat. Sleep. Eat. sleep. Eat. Sleep. You look different.
- Have you lost weight?
- OH, NO, WAIT! THAT'S NOT IT!
- YOU'RE EMPTY!
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS!! Glop.
- -and a sprig of rosemary!
- Glop with a sprig of rosemary. Is it true that you have nine lives?
- No.
- It just seems that long when living with YOU. I'm the most wonderful man in the world?
- You love me madly?
- I ddin't have the heart to tell her it was a wrong number. How thoughtful of you, fantasy boy. Your breath smells like tuna.
- Why, thank you!
- I owe it all to ""Kitty Tuna mints""! BEWARE Of The DOGS
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Oops, I'm late for another appointment!
- I'm going to turn you over to my assistant, Spot! Uh...
- How's it going, pal? Uh...
- According to your chart, I'm to bark at you, right? Uh...
- Arf! Come on! Is this how you treat a regular customer? Question, Odie...is dog food made from dogs?
- Urp slap
- ZIP Nah, it doesn't taste stupid enough.
- Odie, let's talk effort versus return here.
- You know, you can still lead a pointless life without all that running around. Odie, in honor of your gullibility...
- I'D LIKE TO PRESENT YOU WITH THIS INVISIBLE TROPHY!
- GARFIELD! Odie can't remember where he buried his bone.
- Yes...
- It's the dreaded glasses-on-the-forehead syndrome. It had to happen.
- Odie chased his tail once too often.
- Now it's hiding from him. And now, to explain why dogs drool so much, here's the dog who wrote the book...
- -ODIE!
- Swim on over here, pal! YAWN
- I'm exhausted.
- Must sleep.
- Now I'm wide awake.
- Now I'm sleepy.
- Wide awake.
- Z Now what? I drew up a list of thing I don't want you to claw.
-
- I guess I should have put the list on the list. Nobody knows what the mysterious cat is thinking.
-
- Not even the mysterious cat. YAWN
-
- Hey, I was just thinking about you.
- How about giving me a big smile? Why?
- You already have one. I'm going to go make a sandwich.
- Well, be quick about it.
- I don't have all day to stel it, you know. Do you ever get that sleepy feeling in the middle of the afternoon?
- I do.
- And this afternoon has lasted 25 years.
- Mom, dad, Doc Boy...we're here!
- We were bored just sitting at home watching the TV.
- So we came over for a visit.
- You can swat me, but there will be another spider to take my place!
- Very well then. SMACK
- I'll renew my newspaper subscription. I'm not coming any closer.
- SMACK!
- My latest invention: magazine on a stick. Hee, hee, hee. When that cat gets here I'm going to swat him with this magazine!
- Uh-oh...too heavy!
- Couldn't wait for me, huh? Hey, cat!
- This is my lawyer, Sid. I have a restraining order against you!
- Uh, why the smile? I've never squished a lawyer.
- Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
- YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! I wish the cat were here to swat me.
- SMACK
- Ha! Ha! Just kidding! OH! WELL THAT MAKEs IT ALL RIGHT THEN!
- * DING DONG Someone's at the door.
- Hiya, kiddo. Grandma, what brings you here?
- I need a favor. Name it!
- You know that martial arts championship tomorrow?
- Sure. You want to come over to watch it?
- Nope, practice! I'm a contestant! urk Meet Granny the Grip. As it turns out...
- This is NOT my lucky hat!
- I may be just a cat, but it doesn't seem to me that Life is not quite as simple as Jon makes it. Stop whatever you're doing!
-
- I just always wanted to say that. So I don't have to stop? This cat food actually doesn't smell too disgusting.
- Oh, well...
- I'll eat it anyway. Ever have days when you just can't get anything done?
- Days when I can't get anything done? ...no.
- Decades? ...yes. Laziness comes naturally to you, doesn't it?
- Uh-huh.
- If it didn't, I wouldn't attempt it. Okay...everybody off!
- FLEAS!
- YAAAHH!! I only agreed to give them a ride this far. *

-
- SLIP!
- You did that on PURPOSE, didn't you?! * It's going to take more than one STUPID little alarm clock to get ME up this morning! tick tock
- tick tock tick tock Z tick tock tick tock tick tock
- tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock This does not bode well... tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock Cats do strange things.
- Strange...
- Cats do things? You know, today bears a striking resemblance to yesterday.
- For all I know, this could be yesterday.
- Don't you have anything to do? Nothing that can't wait until tomorrow. It says here that all good yodelers must warm up.
- WOOO WOOO WOOO
- Let's take this outside. Get back here! Who wants to claw the furniture?
- I do! I do!
- Be right back. I don't like the look of this. Look, Garfield! I finally got a SOCK to fit on my head. Surprised?
- I think what surprises me the most...
- Is that I didn't find that at all surprising.
- Ugh. Burp.
- Sniff. Snuck.
- Kaff. Cough.
- Grunt. Grate grate.
- Smack smack. Haaaack.
- Sigh. Morning talk.
-
- You're probably wondering why this plunger is on my face. I refuse to play your little game. So, my contact slipped all the way back in my eye and I couldn't find it. So, I thogut, ""Hey! Let's do some major suction!"" So, I got this plunger and...well...
- Could you maybe give me some help here? You know, grab the handle and give it a really good twist!
- ...or not... DOY OY OY OING It's kinda nice not having to look at Jon's face.
- On the other hand...
- Stealing his lunch isn't half the fun.
-
- They should put a warning label on those things.
-
- Hey, what's going on? Donut racks only speak when spoken to, pal. twist twist twist
- Well, it's about time!
-
- Garfield, do you love me?
- Let me check.
-
-
-
- Check. I like to start my days slowly.
-
- Then build up to this. If you're patient...
- ...and you wait long enough...
- Nothing will happen. ***********
-
- I couldn't dream last night. The cable was out.
- GULP
- What's for lunch? Swallow your breakfast! Is that all you're going to do? Yes.
-
- As long as there is space, I'm going to stare off into it. It seems like this day will never end!
- Good night, Garfield. Whew!
- I barely got that last complaint in. Oh, joy!
- I'm so hungry I could just eat...
- ...and eat and eat.
- ...and eat and eat and eat.
- ...and eat and eat and eat and eat.
- ...AND EAT AND EAT AND EAT AND EAT AND EAT.
- BUT WHY STOP THERE?! You can anything you want and still lose weight!
- How? Why, by getting out of that chair and committing yourself to a lifetime regimen of rigorous... CLICK!
- Whew! I narrowly avoided the ""E"" word! This may very well be the greatest show in the history of television.
-
- But it's still no match fr my mighty remote! CLICK CLICK
-
- Oops, sorry. I had the remote set on COMIC STRIP. The following program is not a rerun.
- However, it is a lot like a bunch of other shows.
- I'd rather see an original rerun. click My next guest, as you can see, has two heads.
- Has this been a problem for you? A PROBLEM?! NOOO!
- Ever hear the expression ""two heads are better than one!?! ...ever hear it EIGHT GAZILLION TIMES A DAY?!! I think he hit a nerve. click
- Z It...it can't be! It's a dream come true!!!
- Z
- The All-SLEEP channel!!!
- You know, you guys totally absorb my life.
- I never have time to myself!
- Not a minute alone!
- You're always around!
-
- Thank you. Good morning, Garfield.
- Wait a minute! I don't remember putting socks on my hands!
- Gah! My underwear is on the outside of my jammies!! I think I'll spend today far away. I'm ignoring you. Ignoring me?
- And you had to tell me about it?!
- Amateur!
- Are you ignoring me? Not really.
- Because I wish you would. CAN'T I JUST STAND HERE?!
- * ding ZIP!
- GULP Why do I bother baking cookies? You shouldn't eat so fast.
- I think you're right, Jon.
- My teeth were getting hot. BURRRRRRRRRRRR
- ...RRRRRRRRRRP!
- That burp lasted through four rooms! You're amazing. hop hop hop
- Excuse me, Mr. Cat, sir...
- would you like to contribute to our blood drive?
- Even a small donation would be greatly appreciated.
- You're a flea, aren't you? Um...well, uh...Yeh, I guess.
- STONK
- That teeny hurse's cap didn't fool me for a minute. Medic! If you had the chance, would you actually bite me?
- No. My vet put me on a low-fat diet.
- And who says exercise is good for your health? I have an idea, Garfield.
- We ca play a little game.
- Let's play ""Find the Feet"". Is this one of those sarcastic games?
-
- Ypu're fat. Am not. This came in the mail for you.
- Maybe now you'll consider dieting.
- You've been classified as a small planet! Cool! I could go for a S7-course meal.
- You need to go on a diet.
- 56? Today you start your new diet. Oh, no! This calls for desperate measures!
- I must travel back through time to avoid it!
- Hey! Boy, you cave men are ugly! Sigh..
- Well, I'm on a diet again, and you know what that means...
- Sorry I'm late! Food hallucinations.
- There was a little twelve-pickle pileup in the kitchen.
- Traffic was backed up for several floor tiles.
-
- Not very filling, but always entertaining. I had a dream about food.
- BURP
- With onions. Garfield, I know you're on a diet...
- But how would you like a whole, entire bowl of food?
- Here is your veggie burger, Garfield.
- What?!
- Are the cows on strike?
-
- How's the salad? Ask it yourself. I'm not speaking to it. I'll be right back.
- crinkle
- I heard that candy wrapper! What makes you think it wasn't a celery stalk wrapper? Garfield, I've decided to take up woodworking.
- What would you like me to make first?
- Lasagna. Mmmmm...
- Good ol' grass...
- Green...
- Soft...cool...
- And when you lie on it...
- The only way you can look is up.
- Let's hear it for spiritual moments!
-
- Let the bad times roll! Sometimes I have to wonder, Garfield...
- Where is life taking me?
- How about OVER THERE, garlic breath? My back itches.
- Great news, Jon! Your pathetic existence is about to have some purpose!
- I feel so fulfilled. Lower. They've improved your cat food.
- It doesn't look and smell as disgusting as it used to be.
- Then it isn't cat food. There are a lot of things going on in the world you don't know about.
-
- And let's keep it that way. You seem to be in a good mood.
- Out of respect for the fact that you are wrong about everything.
- Z
- Z
- Garfield! Breakfast! Z
-
-
- SHOOP
- Mornings should come equipped with dimmer switches. Jon! Let's hang out together!
- Golly, it seems like we've already spent the whole day together!
- DING DONG * That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Our neighbors are circulating a petition complaining about all the annoying things you do.
- I know. I stole it. SMACK! There are claw marks on the couch.
- Whoa! And I just clawed the couch!
- That's one spooky coincidence, huh? Garfield, I'm not sure you can be trusted.
- Why would you say that?
- Oh, look. I found your wallet. You're a bad boy, Garfield! I can't help it.
- Sometimes couches just cry out to be clawed.
- I'm never taking you to a furniture store again. You're no fun. It would be wrong to pull Odie's tail.
- ...and then kick him off the table.
- What are you doing? Making a list.
-
-
-
-
-
- WOO-HOOO!! Catnip mouse. Maybe I'll claw Jon.
- Maybe I'll go get us some ice cream.
- If anybody claws Jon, they'll have me to answer to! Most of the earth's surface is covered by water.
- Who cares?
- How much of it is covered by lasagna? We can't do anything about the past.
- But we CAN dom something about the future. Sounds like a lot of effort to me.
- I like the future just the way it's going to be.
-
- I am not boring! Tell that to the expression on my face. What's that smell?
- I have no idea.
- But it does seem to be emanating from the general area of my tuna can collection. I couldn't find my hat!
- Then it occured to me that I didn't have one!
- So I didn't wear it! Now I remember why I didn't want to get out of bed. YAWN
- I could sleep all day.
- Z
- Z
- Z
- Oh well...
- If at first you don*'t succeed... You don't have many worries, do you?
- Sure I do...
- Like, can you pull a muscle blinking? Sometimes I like to make Odie feel special!
- Odie, there's nobody as peculiar as you are.
- I'm going off to work in the donut mines. Cool!
- Dig up something with icing! Count on it, good buddy!
- I'm dreaming aren't I? You never ask me about my day.
- How was your day?
- I'm a sock puppet, dummy! What do you think it was like?! It's an extra-long spin cycle for you, pal. Am I bothering you?
- Am I? Am I? Huh? Am I? ...well?
- Because I'm sure bothering myself.
- We now return to ""Garfield Mystery Theater""!
- What happened to my lunch?! Some mysteries are best left unsolved. Garfield.
- Garfield.
- Garfield!
- GARFIELD!!
- GARRRRR
-
- FIEEEEEELD!!!!!
- Lozenge? You don't have much energy.
- Oookaaay...
- And just how much energy do I need to accomplish this? There's a slice of pizza stuck in the ceiling.
- And it appears to be loosening.
- The house needs cleaning. I'm on it. Do you know what this day could use?
- KICK!
- thud A thud. I'm going to see the sights!
-
- Why are you staring at a shade pull? To a cat, this is a sight. Nobody tells me what to do!
- Have something to eat.
- Well, this is a bit awkward. I just heard a joke.
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
- Sometimes it's best to just get those things over with. Sigh...
- Garfield, I'm depressed. What a absolute shock.
- I haven't had a date in months. Time sure flies when you're not having fun.
- Maybe I should give Kimmy a call. Wasn't she the one who was raised by wolves?
- She was raised by wolves, wasn't she? I can still hear her baying at the moon.
-
- Hello, Kimmy? It's Jon Arbuckle! Ask her if she's had her shots. Some days I just can't get started.
- I know what you mean...
- 1994 was like that for me.
- Woo woo woo!
- Personally, I don't think it's any more than a two-woo day. Sigh...
- I have nothing to celebrate.
- For the 100th day in a row! This day needs improving.
- I have to admit, that's not bad. Who knows...maybe someday I'll visit another planet.
- Give it up, Jon.
- You won't be able to get a date there either. Time to see if my teeth are still sharp enough.
- Aaaah! My leg!
- See you again for my six-month checkup.
-
-
-
- HARF HARF HARF HAAAACK
- HARRRRF PTOOEY PTOOEY PTOOEY
- More coffee, boys? Sure! 'bout time! No more of this ""getting older"" stuff! From now on I'll... DONK
- I'll...
- Ow! Soon I'll be 26 years old.
- I hate aging.
- Unfortunately, aging is madly in love with me. What would you like for your birthday, Garfield?
- A featherless canary.
- It wouldn't tickle going down. Nermal, you're the nicest cat I know.
- May I have a word with you, Nermal?
- Nobody's nicer than *I* am, if you know what's good for you. They say the older you get, the wiser you get.
- You must be very, very wise.
- Very, very, very, very, VERY wise! I wonder if anyone will miss him? People love me...know why?
- Because I'm cute, that's why! And you........
- Well, you're deteriorating. I wonder how high ""cute"" bounces? Sigh.
- Birthday brings you lots of things...
- Gray hair...
- Bad eyesight...creaky joints...
- Ear hair, aches, pains, bad teeth...
- Sigh...
- and cake! This year I feel younger than ever!
- No little birthday is going to get ME down, no sir...
- Is it my imagination, or is this strip getting longer? So what, you're going to be 26...
- Time marches on!
- Come back! I'm not getting older, I'm getting better.
- Every day in every way.
- And I'm gonna grow wings and I'm gonna fly, too. Age is a state of mind.
-
- With a healthy dose of denial. I'm not showing my age.
-
- Not for you or for anyone else. Sigh...26...another birthday...another year...another...
- Another...
- What was I just thinking about?
- Jon! Jon!
-
- Man, this is embarrassing.
- I completely forgot what I was going to say!
-
- Now I remember! Your car is on fire. I HATE mondays.
- HEY, GARFIELD! IT'S MONDAAAY!!
- And people who love that I hate mondays. Sigh...
- One of the sad realities of life...
- The laundry always cools off. Bewar eOf
- ""Beware Of...""
- Ah... ""Mime Dog"". Z
- SUPPERTIME!
- You fell asleep hanging on the screen door again, didn't you? How'd ya guess? OTHER animals play. OTHER animals frolic.
- We need to make some changes around here! You're right!
- But how do we change all those other animals? I rented a video. Garfield.
- It has everything! Action, adventure...
- And a great sound track! ""The Polka Ninjas"". Sigh...
- I love grass...
- It's cool in the morning...
- Warm in the afternoon...
- And cool again in the evening.
- Mmmmm...
- Kinda like an electric blanket, only in reverse. I've had a really great day today!
- How about you?
- Oh, Garfield. Yeah. Ask him how his day has been. I'm going to get you! Help! Help!
- I'm not buying it, guys.
- I told you we should be facing the same way. Okay, already!
-
- And THAT'S what chasing mice should look like! I notice you didn't catch him. Go on.
- Mice rule!
- Ha! Ha! Ha! I lost a bet. I declare this house mouse free!
-
- Whoa! Cheese has legs! Do you mind?!
- Sorry.
- Uh, Garfield? He's taking a shower. *

- The screws on that chandelier need...
- Tightening. Save me! It's a giant meatball from outer space!
- Never fear! The meatballinator is here!
- I hate waking up. What's your problem?
- My problem?
- I only get to have one? Why don't birds like me?
- Because eat them, you idiot!
- I can live with that. Ice cubes down your pants!
- YAAAHHH! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- Now my soda is warm. I want you to do nothing all day.
-
- Is this some kind of trick?
-
-
- This window is filthy.
- I can't see a thing.
-
- I knew that. It's a beautiful day at the stadium...
- For the world drinking-out-of-the-toilet championship!
- lap lap lap lap Never let a dog pick what you watch. Here we see a typical dog chasing a squirrel.
- And now the dog has cornered the squirrel.
- Here we see the dog trying to remove a pine cone from up his nose. Disgraceful. Today in the news, a giant meteor struck earth, destroying all life.
- What? ...what's that?
- Oops, I guess that didn't happen. You gotta check those sources, bucko. The Bolivioan tree frog lives in... CLICK Boring.
- This is the police! We have you surrounded! Ah.
- Put down the Bolivian tree frog! Okaaay... I believe that television viewers are smarter than people who read books.
- Why is that?
- You can't change a book with a remote, now can you? Good point. click click
- I have this down to a science... click click
- I avoid the shows, and only see the commercials! click click Sigh...
- I'm down.
- Distressed, depressed, and down in the dumps.

-
- Never underestimate the power of positive donuts! I have the urge to exercise.
-
- Whew! Thank goodness it passed. Stop bothering me!
-
- Okay, you can bother me a little, but only if food is involved. DARN IT, GARFIELD! WHEN I SPEAK, PAY ATTENTION!
-
- That's quite enough. Are you done? May I quit now?
- Cats always know when it's time for dinner. We mount miniature closed-circuit video cameras in the bottoms of our food dishes. Ah! The kitchen; where the food is!
-
- Ah! The kitchen; where the food used to be! Garfield. Yes?
- Don't tease Odie! What?
- Where would he het an idea like that?
- Oh, no! I'm losing my hair!
- My dad's bald. Doc Boy does a comb.over!
- NOW I'LL NEVER GET A WOMAN!
- YAAAAH!
- Today, a bald spot...
- Tomorrow, a mohawk! Allow me to introduce a close, dear, and personal friend...
- ...this pork chop.
- Get back here!
- Who was that guy?
-
- Interception! I'd like to have something different for dinner.
-
- LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EAT MY OWN FOOD! What? Is it your birthday or something?
- BURP
- That was unnecessary. You wouldn't say that if you'd just eaten three lunches. Mmm...
- GULP
- Ah, that should hold me until I'm able to move again. Do you ever get cravings for certain foods?
- Boy, I do.
- Right now, I could really go for something edible.
- Here I am!
- The center of the universe!
- Bask in the wonder that is me!
- But don't overdo it.
- Try to keep from getting overexcited and hyperventilating.
- Will you be leaving soon? Oh, very well. bask away! Jon says I should ""seize the day!""
- There's only one problem...
- I can't reach it from here. I'm saving money by cutting my own hair!
-
- You must be saving millions! I am a man of dignity.
- Oh, sure.
- Since I hid his wax lips. I put on running shoes...
- Jogging shorts, and a sweat band.
- That's enough exercise for today. HAH-LOOOOOOOO ELL-ENNNNN

- Dang, she saw right through my suave accent. *I* thought you were yodeling. YAAAAHHHH! Z
- YA

- Thanks. Recurring porcupine petting zoo nightmare.

- Wow...I wish I WERE you. Take a number.
-
- Bad web day. Do tell. Swat me quick. I'm in a hurry.
- SWAT!
- How's that? Thank you. That frees up the rest of my day.
- TWANG! THUD!
- Diet time. You should talk! Is this where the spider convention is being held? Yup.
- SMACK!

- There's noboy there.
- Well then, I guess I'LL talk. He's a lonely, lonely man.
- Who wants to help me doing nothing? Not me.
- I'd probably end up doing all the work. And now, to read some dog poetry, here's Odie!
- Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
- Yip! Yip... Hey! No limericks! I think I'll claw a large stranger.
- OUCH!
- Is that your cat? No. Am so! YAWN
- I won't say that was a long nap, but...
- What year is it? I know you! I'm going out in search of love!
-
- We will never se Jon again.
- STOP STARING AT ME!
- It's good that we have these little discussions.
- Sigh...
- You never pay any attention to me...
- So I'M not speaking to YOU anymore!

- It's not so much the heat, it's the humidity.
- He had that coming. I've gotta find a way to cool off.
-
- Are those frozen peas?! They're a ll the rage this season. I've discovered a new way to beat the summer heat.

- The flag mouse was actually a nice touch. Good work, Garfield! Be ever vigilant!
- HEY! HEY! HEY!
- Don't turn the page yet! If you're going to read over my shoulder, read faster!
-
- Wouldn't you have a better chance of catching the mouse if you actually chased him? I'm counting on his pulling up lame. Eek! A mouse!
-
- Come on. It's his birthday. I'm tired.
- Then have a seat.
- Perhaps I've been too lax on this cat-mouse thing. Garfield! Catch the mouse! I will.
- But, because I'm such a great sport, I'm giving him a head start.
- About a two-week head start. BONK!
- Who wants a hug?
- Somebody?
- Anybody?
- Nobody?

- Time to explore the outer reaches of my universe.

- Uh, Jon... One minute she was there and, the next minute...
- She ditched you. Poof. I wonder if they'll make a movie about my life someday.
- Absolutely!
- But more like a sock puppet show.
- Hmmm...
- Maybe Jon's right.
- ...I SHOULD get outdoors more often.

- Scary, huh? Scary? You'r ejust wearing a grocery sack!
- I'm an empty grocery sack! EMPTY?! I've been lying here for 83 hours and 17 minutes without moving a muscle.
- YES! Only 10 seconds away from my personal bes...
- Nuts. Ellen, when you say hurtful things to me, I just want to curl up and wither away.
-
- She's saying hurtful things. So wither already. Today is a teense less boring than yesterday.
-
- Party on. O-kay...
- Time to get up.
-
- Yup. Gotta get up right now...
-
- Yessir-reedy-deedy-do---up and at 'em...
- What are you doing? Fooling myself. Garfield! Did you eat all three of those cakes I baked?!
- Nope.
- Two and a half. Garfield...
- You've been eating in bed again, haven't you?
- So, Sherlock, what tipped you off? * RIIIING! Hello?
- No, no...it's all right.
- That was the Titanic. They spotted an orange iceberg. I wonder if YOU float? I now do weight and fortunes. You're on.
- You're fat. ...and my fortune?
- I predict you're going to stomp me flat. You're good. If you continue to gain weight at your current rate...
- In 17 years, you'll blot out the sun!
- Where are you going? To get a donut and a flashlight. Low-fat cat food.
-
- DO I LOOK LIKE A LOW-FAT CAT?!
- Have a salad...have A salad...
- HAVE a salad...
- Have a SALAD...
- Ahem...
- Havea SALAD.
- There's just no right way to say that to him. If you close your eyes, you can pretend this lettuce is chocolate cake.
-
- If you close YOUR eyes, I can have REAL chocolare cake! Hey, Jon, check out my new diet!
- munch munch GULP
- Did you notice I chewed before I swallowed? How's the diet going? Hey!
- Somebody out there's eating!
- I withdraw the question. BACON! How's the diet going? Great!
- I've cut out snacks.
- I did, however, have eleven lunches. I've eaten all the donuts...
- Now they can't tempt me to cheat on my diet.
- Flawless logic, if ever I've heard it! Are you having a good time?
- BECAUSE I'M NOT! SPLOT
- Wait. That was kind of fun. GARFIELD BURP

- Hi! Whoa.
- Say, aren't you the invisible man?
- No, I'm not.
- He's shorter than I am.
- He's only about this tall. Oh, yeah.
- But don't feel bad. A lot of people confuse us. I think I'll wake up now. Why are acts so mysterious?
- Allow me to explain by way of an interpretive dance.
- Why is a dog's nose so cold?
- Let's find out.
- Ah-ha... *
- GOING
- WHERE did you get the gong? Spanky's house of all things dinner. Cats are very clean animals.
- They even clean themselves with their tongues.
- But not you! We're out of conditioner. Garfield, I think that girl down the counter is looking at me! No she isn't.
- I think she wants to meet me! No she doesn't!
- I may have been mistaken. Yes, you were. I'm so bored I can't believe it.
- Not me.

- Good morning, sir. Thank yo-...morning=
- MORNING?!! They just might want to draw those blinds.
- Boo! Pardon?
- Boo. I'm a ghost. You don't say.
- Oh, yes. I'm quite frightening. No, you're not.
- I'm not? Not even close.
- Are you sure? I find you yery pleasant.
- I wish I were dead. I'm not sure how to break this to you, pal. Ambition! Drive, fortitude, gumption, determination...
- I've always wanted to say those words. Time to take a break, Odie.
-
- Our breaks are so long, our breaks need breaks. Ah...AH...
- CHOO!
- So, would you like some toast? Not in this lifetime. Sometimes I sleep so much I can't tell if it's day or night.
- Sometimes I eat so much I can't tell if I'm hungry or full.
- Ignorance is bliss. Oh, Ellen...
- My love for you is like an endless void...
- Wait! Wrong smile! That's the one about your head.
- Sack time.
- Z Beware of Dog GRRRR

- Narcissism...use it or lose it Say, good lookin'.

- Hey, mirrors need love, too. Oh, geez.
- I need a haircut bad.
- Try shedding, it's cheaper! I thought I was going to seize the day...
- But the day seized me instead. Poor Jon.

- Bark! Bark! Bark! Where is he going?! Spotted a squirrel.
- SLAM!
- Look at what I bought at the store, Garfield...
- A 20-pound turkey!
- We can roast it, and eat it, and then use the leftovers for sandwiches!
-
- Why did I say ""leftovers""? What are leftovers? Garfield, are you happy?
-
- No food, no happy. Come on out! No!
- Come and get me, bozo!
- Dinner, Garfield? No thanks. I just ate a small house.
-
- That was a nutritious meal! Yeah, I didn't like it either.
-
- Garfield! Dinner!
- Disappointed? Kinda. There you are!

-

- You SHOULD...you ate the whole thing. I'll be digesting that baby till the spring thaw. Hello, Lisa? It's Jon Arbuckle...
- -and there just happens to be a huge hole in my social calendar for new year's eve.
- She told me to take my calendar and spackle it. How diplomatic. Denise, it's Jon...
- Hey, howzabout just the two of us going out on new year's eve?
- Guess it'll just be the one of us. Are you sure YOU want to go out with you? Ellen, will you go out with me on new year's eve?

- Know what I call someone like that? Frisky? Time for a nice nap...
- Th eice-cream truck is coming up the street!
-
- Looks like we've got ourselves in a real dilemma here... You are the laziest creature on earth.
- YES!
- I'd celebrate, but that might cost me my ranking. Imagine what your life would be like if you had wings.
- Grim...
- I'd have to sleep on my stomach.
- You mice have it nice.
- A little cheese and you're happy. You got that right.
- Not so with cats.
- We need more out of life. More?
- Like naps. But that's less!
- With cats, less IS more. Z
- Huh? What happened?
- You're awake. Oh, so that's what this is. SOMEone clawed the couch.
- *I* have claws!
- Ooh! Ooh! Blame me! Blame me! I can't figure this riddle out.
- And they printed the answer upside down!
- Oh, great! The answer's right side up, but now the eiddle's upside down! That's my exit cue.
-
- Dogs put way too much effort into doing nothing. Ellen, words cannot describe my feelings for you...
- -so let me express them with music instead.
- Anna-one, anna-two... Anna bye-bye, Ellen. I thought we were going to have fun today. Hmmm...
- REMEMBER that nap we took?
- Maybe it happened again. Ungh.

- Not anymore. It's like Jon always says, you can't have too much cat hair in the house.
-
- Well he doesn't ALWAYS say it.
-
- GARFIELD! Like I can stop shedding on command! I'm going to rake the living room.
-
- I was shedding in the kitchen, too!
- You're a good friend, Odie.
- And do you know why?
- Because even after all I've done to you over the years...
- You must turn the other cheek and take it in stride.
- Kick Me I'm bored.
- OW!
- You kicked me! And now you're not bored! Today I got my head stuck in a wastebasket. Uh-huh.
- The I got the wastebasket stuck in a trash can. Okay...
- Then I got the trash can stuck in a dumpster. Let's skip to the landfill, shall we? Garfield? Yes?
- You glued my elbows to the table again, didn't you? Yup.
- And my cup, too! Now, try to take your hand off your face.

-
- Yes, we are.
- I'm staring yt you!
- Who can blame you? *
-
- Out of my way, bozo.
- I said step aside, Clyde!
- Very well, I'll just stand here until you move.
-
- Garfield! It's been days! Where have you been? Waiting for a guy to melt. sniff sniff sniff sniff
- Ahhhh...the smell of burning goats.
- Jon's turned the furnace on.
- OKAY, GUYS, THE COAST IS CLEAR!
- Advance scout. I love winter.
- FWUMP
- -about this much. Look, Jon! I built a snowcat!
- What's that? Well, what do you know!
- I believe he hacked up a snowball. The forecast calls for a really bad blizzard today.
-
- Great. Now I'll be stuck here till the snowplows come. Someday it will warm up.
- And you will melt into a puddle of water.
- Nevertheless, I wouldn't mind a sweater today.
- High five.
- SLAP
- OIOIOING!

-
- Oooh! You must be the cat with the rolled-up newspaper!
- SMACK
- I thought he was one of those urban legends.

- Z Hammock.

- I hate humidity. No kidding.
-
- Is that a chain? I've put on a little weight, okay? All hail! I am king of the spiders!
- SMACK!
- I might have been more impressed if I were a spider as well. Good point. Wouldn't you like to be like your old man when you grow up, son?
- SMACK!
- Gee, I wonder what mom's up to?
- I've gained weight.
- Now I've lost it...
- Now I've gained it again!
- And I lost it again!
- NOW IT'S BACK!!!
- YAAAAHHH! That's for not changing my batteries, lardo! You think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?
-
- Why are you looking at me like that? This is the stare of agreement. GOTTA DANCE!
- WAAHHH CRASH

- Bad ear day. tap tap tap tap
- YAAAHHH! I CAN'T STAND THE BOREDOM!

- And what are they?
- Fire drills and skinny.dipping. I guess I'll park it here for tonight.
- Would you mind hooking me up? Not at all.
- Air conditioning. It's been nice visiting with you, Mr. Snail, but I have to leave. Me too.
-
- Say, you're faster than you look. Back at you. Boy, snails have it good.
- They can retreat into their shells, shut out the world, and sleep away.
- I should be so lucky.
- !
- NAP AHOY!
- Oh, no!
- My sock puppet has turned into a bloodthirsty zombie!
- He attacks an unsuspecting victim!
- What are you doing, Garfield? And sucks his life forces rigth out through his skull! Sigh Oh! This is so horrible I can't watch!
- I'm going to throw this thing into the washer. It's evil! Use bleach! Hey! Where did my lunch go?!
- BURP
- Oh, yeah. Uh-oh. Lunch doesn't agree wit hbreakfast.
- They're battling it out...
- BURP -and lunch wins. I finished gnawing the furniture. Now I'm off to eat some cheese and then to chew on socks.
- Garfield... I'm on it, Jon.
- Pace yourself! Bark What?
- BARK What?
- BARK! Well there's no need to yell. Ellen, if you hand up on me, you'll break my heart.
- CLICK
- Nowww we wait for the guilt to set in. And wait...and wait...and wait...
- I always find it amazing how cats can stare out into space for hours on end.
- Z
- A lone donut!
-
-
-
- Aren't you going to eat that? Not yet.
- I'm waiting for the rest of the herd to return. Nothing makes sense anymore!
- My world is spinning out of control!
- Here. Salvation! That's breakfast, lunch, and dinner...
- Oh...and a couple of snacks!
- Now all I have to do is chew! You're disgusting. The mighty hunter stalks his prey.
- He circles and closes in upwind...
- He singles out the weakest taco... You can't always get what you want.
-
- I can, but you can't. It's here!
- BURP
- You somehow manage to eat the pizza before it arrived. I have friends high up in the delivery business. Cat treat!
-
- What this place lacks in ambience, it makes up for in service. Hey, pal. Hey.
- You know, Garfield, I once considered becoming an actor. Do tell.
- Possibly reciting Shakespeare on stage. Whoa.
- Or maybe a leading man in the movies. Really?
- I might have had mobs of screaming fans. You know it!
- Even my own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I like the sound of this.
- Yes, it's video and pizza night! You GO, guy! Listen to this old superstition, Garfield...
- ""If a cat sneezes near a bride, it means she will have good luck in her life"".
- Sure, like that's going to happen i nTHIS house... What. ""A strange dog following you is good luck"".
- ""A howling dog is a sign of bad luck"".
- AAARRROOOO Ar, ar, ar...""If a cat sneezes, it is a sign of rain"".
- 'choo.
- Cool. ""To cure illness in a family...""
- ""Wash the patient, and throw the water on the cat"".
- KAFF KAFF sniff sniff I get no respect around here. ""So the princess kissed the dog...""
- ""and he turned into a handsome prince.""
- I love this story. It gives him hope. Here's an interesting factoid, Garfield.
- Certain kinds of birds can't fly.
- If you squeak up quiet enough, none of them can. grumble grumble
- Snackie time.
- Let's see...applesauce? ...polish sausage? ...cheese ball?
- Corn dog? Yogurt? Cold pizza? Pickle chips?
- Beef log? Pork chop? Green grapes? Pig's knuckles? Spanish olives? Walleyed pike? Headcheese? Pot pie? Bean burrito?
- Aw, what the heck...
- I'll just go with the buffet. Uh, Garfield... Wake up, Garfield! It's 4 A.M.!
- I have a great idea!
- Let's watch the sunrise! Okay, you can watch it from the ambulance.

- Why do you do that? I didn't see YOU volunteering. My life is missing something.
- That's it!
- Lunch! You know...
- You don't take naps...
- Naps take you. Hi, Ellen, it's Jon.
- Do I feel what? ...in my back? ...my leg? ...my head?
- Ellen, voodoo dolls don't really work. Ouch! Jon appears deep in thought.
- Pie is good.
- Wow, deeper than I thought! Operators standing by!
- Yes, you too can be more popular with women if you use Babe Magnet Body Lotion!

- You know what?
- We needed a new toaster anyway. You're glowing. You don't scare me. I'm not supposed to.
- You're supposed to scare ME.
- Oops. Rookie. Ellen, how about I zip over to your place and serenade you with my accordion?
-
- ""Restraining Order"" is such an ugly word, Ellen. That's two words, dummy.

- Not that I spend a lot of time looking at it. You gotta know your limits...
- For instance, I can only eat so much...
- Then we run out of food. I wish I were more popular.

- You could have asked nicely! Where's the fun in that? Sigh...
- Well, Jon went up to fix the leaky roof again...
- Who knows why our roof leaks...
- Maybe our shingles are cracked...
- Or warped...
- WHUMP!
- ...but I strongly suspect they're loose. Mommy... Well, well, you're finally up!
- Do you realize you slept for 23 straight hours? *

- That sign was somewhat underestimated. I asked that cute librarian out again today.
- And?...

- Then we rode the screaming weevil. Hey! I'm having breakfast here! Bad date, Garfield.
- She left in the middle of the meal with the valet parking guy.
- In my car. Ouch.
- You know, Garfield, sometimes I feel like a failure.
- Maybe I could have made better decisions in my life.
- Jon, you decided to have pets who love you...
- So you can never be a failure. pat pat
- Now, this self-pity thing isn't going to delay dinner, is it? You know...
- It's not the size of the nap that counts...
- -it's howmany you can squeeze into an afternoon.
-
- So much for home barbering. I thought I did a pretty good job.
- Excuse me. Have you seen my uncle Dave? Perhaps.
- What does he taste like? The simple act of sitting in a chair...
- ...Odie...
- Not even a whisper of a clue. I'm a lonely guy, Garfield.
- Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely...
- -lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely... Here's a pet survey, Garfield.

- Hello, Mrs. Feeny. How are you?
- She's NOT fine! I kinda figured that. That was Mrs. Feeny.
- Although she was kind of hard to understand.
- I think she said she wanted her dentures back. She'll have to arm wrestle my sock puppet for them. * RIIINNG
- * RIIINNG
- * RIIINNG I'm not going to answer that. You'd better. Mrs. Feeny's on her cell phone in the front yard. That was Mrs. Feeny. Yeeeees?
- What's all this about her chihuahua and papier-mache?
- Let's just say the mummy lives. SLAM!
-
- Never flirt with a touchy grocery checker. I notice she double-bagged you.
-
- STOP!
- The cook lost his cell phone!
- ** ** That would explain the ringing in my ears. You know...
- I'd give anything to know what's going on inside that head of yours. Hmm.
- 500 pounds of lasagna oughta do it. You're drooling. I'm headed out. So?
- I'm going downtown. Who cares?
- To get cat food. I miss you already, buddy! Sometimes I'm wondering what you're thinking, Odie.
-
- Obviously, that makes two of us.
- Oh, well...

- * Yodel-odell-odell-odell-ayy-EEE-oooooh. The pig looks better in lederhosen than Ida Mae does. Did you miss me? Yes, I did, Jon.
- In fact...
- I wasn't done missing you. Would you mind leaving again?

- FLOP Odie can't count to three, so he just spins until he passes out. Z I don't mind birthdays.
- I really don't.
- It's the AGING thing that curdles my cheese. I'm going to be 27.
- You'd think I'd be older and wiser by now.
- You'd think. Looks like you have another birthday creeping up on you.
- At my age, birthdays don't creep anymore...
- They just burst through the door and march right in. 27...where do the years go?
- If only I could turn back the hands of time...
- And take all thos enaps all over again. I hear you're having a birthday?
- What should I get an old geezer like you?

- Wow...27.
- HEY...I...THINK...THAT'S...GREAT!! Sigh...
- Another birthday.
- This one's number 27...
- And that's pretty old for a cat.

- How about this one?
- The clip-on that screams, ""I'M A DORK!"" Ladies and gentlemen, man's best friend...

- So, what's YOUR favorite snack food? So, I sneak up on this cat, see...

- Which explains the genoa salami in my left ear. I'll ge the forceps and mustard. Oh, sure...
- We cats didn't invent the nap.
- We merely perfected it. You shouldn't just lie here, Garfield. I shouldn't?
- Cool...
- I'm a rebel! If you stay there long enough, you'll get covered with dust...
- And eventually, nobody will be able to see you!
- Good. Then maybe the nagging will stop. That ceiling looks like a wall.
- Which proves my point.
- Standing is overrated. Getting some rest? Nope...
- I'm doing nothing.
- The two can appear amazingly similar to the untrained eye. One thing about cats...
- They're very curious animals.
- And why is that, Garfield? Don't know, don't care.

- BOOT!
- That's where I'm placing the blame, anyway. Ellen, I just wanted you to know...I already HAVE a date for friday!
- YES, a mammal! Go easy on her, she's really hurting.
-
- My peanut butter cups! MY mid-morning, post-breakfast, pre-nap snack. Bad date, Garfield.
- She was a mime.
- What does this mean? Some things are best left unsaid.
-
- Is that a canary feather? Not anymore.

- poo I saw THE cutest girl in the supermarket today...she was so...
-
- Do you even care? Only if you remembered to buy the donuts. I saw THE cutest girl at the bowling alley today.
- She was working at the snack bar.
- I've never eaten so many (burp) nachos in my life. I'll bet *I* have. I saw that cute perfume tester girl at the mall again.
- I asked her if she wanted to go to Wienerworld in her break.
- Then she hosed me with ""Eau de Sauerkraut"". Goes well with wieners. I saw THE cutest girl in the kissing booth at the fair today.
- So I bought her whole roll of tickets...
- Then she went on break and Delores the Wonder Chimp stepped in for her. Is that banana on your breath? What's that, Heidi?
- You hate me with every fiber of your being?
- That may not be a good sign.
- Depending on how many fibers her being has. GOBBLE GOBBLE SNARF SNARF GULP!

- If you think I'm throwing it back, you're nuts! What a day!
- I thought it would never end. And just whose fault is that?
- I took several naps and it zipped right away.
-
- You'd have to slow the comic strip WAY down to see that. Where's the fish?
- On vacation.
- Oh, look. He sent you a postcard! I think I'll bat that ball of yarn.

- I'm free to...uh...

- I'm going to scare Jon.
- Heeey, that's a great look for you!
- It is? Just super!
- But it NEEDS something...
- Ah! Here it is!
- You're not taking me seriously, are you? Perfect! This is a warm moment, isn't it? Sure.
- A man and his cat. Whatever.

- What? I've never loved you more than at this very moment.

- Good!
- Aside from the incessant, compulsive lying. crack crack crack
- Dear Santa, this is Garfield.
- I am writing to tell you about my behavior this past calendar year.
- It has been good. Very good...nay, outstanding...nay, nay, exemplary.
- I might even go so far as to say that I have been a paragon of virtue, a shining example...indeed, a role model and ispiration to cats everywhere.
- ...across this great land of ours...not to mention the entire universe!
- If you're gonna lie, lie big!
-
- If Santa brings me what I want, he gets the hat back. Christmas is coming.
-
- For those of you unable to take a big, fat hint.
-
- Burp Awww...
- You look like you could use some Christmas cheer!
- If I live to be a hundred, I will still never understand cats. I finally found the perfect Christmas stocking.

- Christmas and cookies... I'll start the oven. Hey, Odie, look at this!
- Jon's baking Christmas cookies!
- Mrs. Feeny sent us another fruitcake this year.
- It looks exactly like the one she sent us last year.
- But we threw that one away...

-
- boing!
- Got a trampoline for Christmas. Hi, Beth, it's Jon...wanna go out for new year's?
- Married? ...wow. And children, too? How many?
- Nobody has 400 kids, Beth. That's a lot of sippy cups. Hi, Lisa, are you free on new year's eve?
- AIIIYYYEEEE THUD!

- This year I resolve to grow a moustache!
- A bigm HONKING moustache!
- And I resolve to work out!
- And to let my hair grow long and wavy!
- And to put you on a diet.
- Heck with it. Wanna order a pizza? Make it TWO. Here I come, world!
- What's that?
- The world wants five more minutes.
- SLURP!
- How's it going? Never better!
- Have a nice day!
- I can't escape the feeling there's something I should be doing. Beware of the Vicious Dog. Look, Garfield! A rubber mousie! Fetch it!
- Fetch it, Garfield! Fetch, fetch, fetchy-fetchy fetch, fetch, fetch!
- FETCH! Do you have dipping sauces? Beth, go out with me or my heart will be broken!
-
- She said leave her alone of my legs will be broken. She's just being coy. I accidentally glued a piece of paper to my face. What a shame.
- Allow me to fix it.
- Why am I not happy? Oh, but you are. chew chew chew
- f-f-f
-
-
- AH
- CHOO
- What time is it?
- Sorry. I'm not wearing a watch.
- That was a little clock humor. How about a little hammer humor? Dogs can be lazy.
- CAN be.
- Thy just aren't as dependable as cats.
- Dinner will be a little late.

- Pardon?
- You'll take me up on that? Long way to dog paddle with water wings. Garfield, what do you want on your bologna?
-
- A steak!
- Maybe I should start eating mice...
- If I ate mice, I wouldn't have to wait around for Jon to feed me.
- You don't want to do that.
- Why not?
- Have you SEEN the mice in this house? Garfield, why don't women like me?
- They all say, ""Oh, Jon, you're so nice...you'll make someone a wonderful husband,"" but I'm never right for them.
- Why, Garfield, why?!! Because they're lying to you, Jon. Really?...you will?
- KLONK
- I Have a DAAAATE!! It's the end of the world as we know it! You ate the flowers I bought for my date!
- Now what am I going to do?
- Have her smell my breath. I'm ready for a date! Whaddaya think? Oh, YEAH!
- You sure it's not too much? No way! You da man! Go get 'em! Atta boy! SLAM You don't want to know how my date went.
-
- Which means I DO want to know how your date went! The strangest thing, Garfield...my date had one nostril bigger than the other.
- When she inhaled, it wheezed like a kazoo.
- And when she EXHALED... Make him stop. Z
- BUMP! What was that?
- I heard something go bump in the night!
- BUMP! There it is again! ...it's getting louder! It's coming this way!
- BUMP! The bump in the night is coming for me!!
- BUMP! EEEYAAAAHHH!!
- It's cold out here. I THED I'm sorry. Notice how calmly I'm waiting to be fed.
- Here.
- Now, where are my pants? All in good time. Catch the ball, Odie!
-
- I may have thrown it a bit too hard. If you ate less, you would weigh less.
- Interesting theory...
- If only there were a way to test it.
-
- That could be for almost anything. I am not worthy of you.
- You got THAT right.
- So much for humility. You got THAT right. So, the moral of the story is...
- I'm back!
- I was telling a story and you left! You're not going to tell it again, are you?
- eeerrrrrggghhhh
- nnnnnggghhhhh

-
- THIS would be much better. ROT DO FUROE
-
- OUT OF ORDER Just look at that snow...
- There's something strangely entertaining about watching it snow...
- Of course, watching Jon with his tongue stuck to the mailbox ups the entertainment value considerably. What a day...my pants fell down.
- Right in public, too!
- I don't think anyone noticed. At least they got your good side.
- Today...
- I'm going to show you...
- How to transform something...

- Inner beasts don't DO frothy and fruity. Ah! There's Mrs. Feeny...
- Say hello to my snowball, you old crank.

-
- Quiet, please, I'm in the home stretch.
- I escaped from the zoo!
- I'm free!
- Yahoo!
- Whoopee
- Um...yeah.
- Well, gotta get back. It's feeding time. Take me with you. I'm a simple man, Garfield. A simple man with simple needs.
-
- Simple man need woman. Simple woman. Bad date, Garfield.
- We went spelunking...
- At her place? At her place. Dinner was going so well...
- Then she excused herself from the table and never came back.
- She didn't even touch her food. All right already! Get to the doggy bag part! Bad date, Garfield.
- We went on a romantic canoe ride...
- And she drowned my banjo. Not a jury in the world... Hello?
- You're calling to say you won't go out with me?
- Who's calling, please? The entire female population. Bad date, Garfield.
- We went for a walk in the woods...
- And a tree fell on her. Did she make a sound? Z

- You've got a little mustard riiight there. An awful thing happened on the way to the studio this morning.
- A furry creature ran in front of my car.
- But, no sense wasting a good squirrel! Low-budget cooking show. Frank, dearest, there's something I MUST tell you. Go ahead, my darling. Tell me...
- ...uh...
- This has been ""Writer's Block Theatre"". Oh, Dirk, I know you love me, and I love you...but our love can never be!
- Okay, bye.
- Um, Dirk? Dirk's gonna paaaay... We have with us tonight a man who hasn't spoken in 32 years. Good evening, sir. Good eve
-
- Uh...can I take that back? No, sir. You distinctly spoke.
- No, I didn't. There! You spoke again! His lips aren't really moving that much. Shirley, I think the monster is behind that door! Oh, Bob!

- Good evening.
- We ask that you please remain seated for the duration of the performance...
- ...and to kindly hold your applause until the show's conclusion.
- Also, no smoking, talking, flash photography, beepers, laser pointers, or cell phones.
- KONK!
- -or pineapples. How about chunked pineapple? Ellen, my dear...
- It's impossible for me to put into words the way I feel about you.
- But I have composed a little yodel that I think says it all. I have a thing for you, Ellen.
- Ad it won't go away.
- Kinda like a rash. I need air. Ellen put me on hold.
- Interesting song...
- Sounds like a dial tone. You folks go on about your business. We're going to be here for a looong time. Ellen, I'm your man!
- And you'r emy woman!
- My woman hung up on her man. And his cat isn't surprised. Let's play ""Hide and Seek,"" Garfield!
- Eight, nine, ten...READY OR NOT, HERE I COME!
- You're not hiding, are you? It's friday night. Will someone out there please date this man? Ellen, how about going to the drive-in tonight? What's showing?...
- Who CARES, baby?!
- click! I said that out loud, didn't I? Dibs on the TV remote.
- Another breakfast just like the one before...
- Jon enjoying his coffee...
- Odie with his ever-present dingle ball...
- Sigh...same ol', same ol'...
-
- Yessss. Hmm...
- I think I'll order the fish of the day.
- How about you? I'll go with the cow of the day. I don't know, Garfield...
- This place looks pretty fancy.
- I have sixteen forks. Which one is for scratching your nose? I'm starving. Where's that waiter?
- * WHONK
- THAT got his attention. So, Garfield, did you have room for dessert?
-
- WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA! WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA!
-
- WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA! Garfield, the next time we go to a restaurant, remember...
- The food at other tables...
- BELONGS TO OTHER PEOPLE! Who made up that stupid rule?
- One cookie left...
- That one old cookie that's lain in the bottom of the jar forever.
- Covered in the ancient dust of a million other cookies and the fingerprints of a million grimy hands.
- ...stale, rock hard, and hideously malformed...the ""elephant cookie"" of cookies.
- And yet, as brutally graphic as my dissertation has been...
- I'm not going to be able to talk myself out of eating it. Eileen Bultwiger...I had SUCH a crush on her.
- Sigh
- I hope she's fat now. I sense bitter here. Garfield, when it comes to women, I play hard to get.
- Yeah, right.
- How can you play hard to get when they play hard to find? That was Debbie calling to cancel our date.
- Funny...we didn't have a date.
- In fact, I don't even KNOW a Debbie. A girl can't be too careful. I just wish I could meet a girl.
-
- Who wouldn't beat me with hre purse. Well, now you're just being picky. I'm going on an imaginary date tonight!
- Sad...
- Even his imagination is desperate. Right, thanks for the reminder, Janice.
- She calls me once a week to tell me she'll never go out with me.
- She can't stop thinking about me. You devil. Z

- Z Time to spring into action!
- Huuuuut!

- Sad...
- So your life has no meaning at all... BEWARE OF SIGN
- Dumb sign.
- SMACK!! Who wants to have a party?!
-
- Me neither. Becky, how about if we
-
- I almost managed to ask her for a date before she hung up on me.
- I must talk faster! Now you got it. Dinner!
- Gimme! JUST a minute...
- Other cats meow when they want their food.
-
-
- ...line? MEOW!
- Garfield, that woman smiled at me.
- Wait, was that a flirting smile, or a pity smile?
- Or a ""look-at-the-zit-on-his-forehead"" smile?! Mr. Insecurity. Hey there, what's up?
- I'm being annoyed by some guy with a cat.
- The brute. And thinl how embarrassed his poor cat must be. That's my date and me at the fall dance.
- The theme that year was ""undersea fantasy"".
- It was just a coicidence that she had gills. My, she's a lovely shade of green. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
- -Please, please, please, please, please, please go out with me.
- One more ""please"" might have done it. No, that would have sounded like begging. Karen thinks she and I should see other people.
- She thinks it would be healthy for both of us.
- An odd conversation for a first date... But civilized. I have ESP.
- I know exactly what you're going to say.
- I'm going to pull your ears over your head and tie them into a knot. Then I'm going to stretch your upper lip over your chin, and then I'm going to pull your right shoe off and stuff it up your left nostril. I knew that.

- Yup.
- Say it IS big. Hey! The good night kiss was a disaster.
- I missed her face and kissed her bug zapper.

- Hi, Ellen? It's Jon! How have you been?
- Great! And work, how's work? ...oh, good to hear!
- Hey, listen, Ellen, I suppose you're wondering why I called...
- You see, it's been quite a while since I had a date...
- And I'm about as desperate as a monkey in a banana famine.
- I've gotta work on my smiles. Or grow a tail... This movie looks interesting...
- It's a courtroom drama. I don't really get into those.

- Remember you said you only date men who live dangerously?
- Well, yesterday I ran with scissors! He laughs in the face of stupidity. I really like talking to you, Ellen...
- I really, really, really like talking to you.
- Please say something back. Her mother told her if she couldn't say anything nice... Ellen, I think it's time we take our relationship to another level.
- Pardon?
- That's not another level, Ellen. That's another country. Jon isn't as stupid as he looks. I'm ready for my big date!
-
- I don't have a big date! Yeah, the word ""big"" gave you away. Ellen...bless you...did you get...bless you...the flowers...bless you...I sent?

- Bacon frying. I may not be rich, Ellen.
- But remember one thing...
- Money can't buy happiness. You rent it? So, Ellen, what are my chances of a date with you?
- SLAM!
- I heard a door slam. I'd say those were your chances leaving the building. Ellen, I've decided to go out with you.
- But you'll have to beg.
- Waaaah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! So much for reverse psychology. you said it, Sigmund. Ellen, I have something to tell you.
- I only have a week to live.
- YEEES!! So much for the sympathy angle. You have all mine. I'm a real cute guy, Wendy.
- Like a small woodland creature.
- Wendy doesn't date weasels. Wendy's clever. Do you know what I think?
- YAWN!
- Yes.
-
-
-
-
-
-
- You know, Garfield...
- Some pets are actually entertaining. Really?
- Hey! Where can WE get some of those?! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Notice how cool I remained during your two-hour dissertation?
- I noticed you fell asleep at one point. ULTRA cool! If you chewed longer, it would seem like you had more food.
-
- No, if I had more FOOD it would seem like I had more food.
-
- Keep away from my fish dinner! Is this tie too big?
- Not at all...
- As long as your circus friends don't object, neither do I! Saturday night and no date again.
- How about a game of checkers? Checkers?
- Hey! I THOUGHT those went down hard. PING-A-TINK
- PING PING PTINK PTOINK
- PTOINK PTANK PTOONG koink KEENK KWANK
- Strange... KWINK KEE-TANK KANK-KANK KINKA TINKA KOINK KOINK

- Have you checked the dryer, dimwit? And what IS that noise? KA-KINK KA-KINK ptoink PLINKA PTOINK KEENK KWEENK P-KOINK I have a note from a secret admirer!
- I'm not surprised...
- If I admired Jon, I would want to keep it a secret, too. I've written down some witty things to say to my date tonight.
- ""Howdy doo!""
- ""How's tricks?"" Ladies and gentlemen, shecky Arbuckle. Women are crazy about love poems.
-
- What rhymes with ""Wolverine""? ""Loser"". I have a date, Garfield.
- This woman is VERY particular.
- If you know what I mean. She only dates geeks? Big date tonight, Garfield.
- She likes her men to smell masculine.
- I haven't showered in three days! That explains the dead fern. Cough.
- Hee! Hee! Hee!
- My date showed up! She just happened to be invisible! I didn't say anything.
-
-
-
-
-
- Everyone on the PLANET loves cats!
- And anyone who doesn't...
- Is a SPACE ALIEN! Oh, boy...
- Do you know what people think when they see a man in a top hat?
- Sophistication. Or, you must have a funny-shaped head. Would you say my lips are pouty and kissable? I don't know.
- KISS
- Pouty? No. Kissable? Yeees, but not that fireworks-going-off, give-you-goose-bumps kind of kissable. poo! poo! Sometimes I feel like everybody hates me.
- That's not true, Jon.
- Not everybody knows you! I worry too much.
-
- Or not enough.
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- And just what are you laughing at? Oh, my...where to start...where to start...
-
-
-
-
-
- My life is a lonely one, Garfield.
- A lone man roaming a barren land...
- SAAAAY... I was afraid of this. My date tried to have me arrested for being boring.
- And I don't even think it's illegal!
- I notice you're not professing innocence. My date just never warmed up to me.
- I even stuck french fries in my ears and hung a spoon on my nose.
- Women...they're a real mytery, huh? It's what's inside that counts.
- Beauty is only skin deep.
- You can't judge a book by its cover. Guess who has a blind date tonight? Bad date, Garfield.
- She tried to run me over with her truck.
- Fortunately, eighteen-wheelers aren't all that maneuverable. You can pick 'em, all right. A blind date, at a monster truck rally, what was I thinking?
- She had long, red hair running down her back...
- None on her head...just down her back. Okay, you can stop right there. Showtime!
-
- Uh-oh...grapes.
-
-
- Missed me!
- doink Garfield, I'm lonely.
-
- As in ""in need of COMPANIONSHIP""! I'll pencil you in for next week. Those old bones don't move like they used to, huh, Garfield?
-
- Or did they ever? That's harassing the aged, fella.
-
- Which way to your cake? The birthday nightmares have begun. Great. Another age nightmare...who are you?
- I'm your memory. What's with the suitcases?
- I'm leaving you. Tiddy boom. Hi! I'm tonight's birthday nightmare! You? You don't look that scary.
- What are you, anyway? A card? Nah.
- I'm a gift certificate for a new hip.
- Better wish for more sand this year.
- Hee hee hee I hate birthday nightmares. shhh!
- Happy early birthday, cat! We've got a SURPRISE for you.
- All right! GULP
-
- PTUI
- He's not looking very happy. Neither is Shirley! Instead of all those birthday candles...
- We decided to use just one to represent your age!

-
- I GOT AN E-MAIL!! Lonely boy. This E-Mail from Dr. Liz says you're due for your annual checkup.
- Do you know whta THAT means? Yeah...
- SHE'S asking to see US! Cold hands and foreign implements. Please reply to Dr. Liz Wilson to confirm your vet appointment.
- Dearest snooky-wooky chicky-boo,
- Reception Let's see...what should I wear when I take you to see Dr. Liz...
- Do you think I should bring flowers? To a vet appointment?!
- I wonder if it's too late to grow a moustache? Oh, this just has fun written all OVER it. Garfield, we must go to the vet.
- You have to get your shots. What does she think I am, a pincushion?
- Sh has treats. The pincushion is ready to leave when you are!
-
-
-
-
-
- The doctor is running a little late...please have a seat.
-
- I hope you brought a snack.
- Wow.
- Look what an ear mite can do. Sooo glad to be here.
-
- Wanna see my rash? Get me out of here. cough
- cough cough
- cough We're at the vet! We're at the vet! We're at the vet!
- Next.
- Sigh Hello-o-o, Dr. Liz...
- Where's your cat? Cat?
- Ohhh! My CAT! I USED to have a name.
- Why are you visiting the vet? For a checkup. I'm fine, actually.
- Are you sure? You look a little green around the gills. Really?
- And there's that scratchy throat thing going around... Cough!
- -that escalates into fierce hacking attacks! COUGH HACK WHEEZE HACK!
- -followed by extreme dizziness, a swollen tongue, and uncontrollable twitching. bl bl bl bl bl bl
- What's wrong with him? He's fine, actually. cough gah nyah nyah Mr. Arbuckle and his cat are in room two, Dr. Wilson. It sounds like a CHICKEN in there.
- Hello, Mr. Ar
-
- buckle. ...and their eyes met across a steinless steel examining table. Uh-huh.
- Okay, stick your tongue out.
- Let me rephrase that. You're looking lovely today, doctor. Nice of you to say so.
- And this is a lovely picture...it really speaks to me. Thank you.
- It's a diagram of a cat's digestive tract. And it's saying, ""feed me"". So doc, are you seeing anyone these days? Just my patients.
-
- Where did he go? He's in the waiting room kissing a sick saint bernard. So how have you been, Mr. Arbuckle? ME?
- Oh, you know me...my social calendar is packed...just PACKED.
- Gee, that's too bad. Will you look at that?! The Queen of England just cancelled! Uh, Liz? Yes?
-
- I choked, didn't I? Like a chicken trying to gargle a bowling ball.
-
- slurk
- Hmmmneeds something.
-
-
- slurk Why don't you move around more?
- Not my fault.
- Gravity wasn't my idea. I'm going to put this shirt on Garfield.
- LAZY It's not true!
- I am not yzal, whatever that means. The universe does NOT revolve around you, you know.
- And just why not?
- Too long a trip. Oh! Good one! Z
- Ahem ZIP!
- I was just clearing my throat! I could have sworn you said, ""breakfast is served"". You know, I've always felt I was destined for great things...
- SNORT!
- What was THAT? A really painful stifled laugh.
- rustle rustle
- Did you get to the article about me yet?
- DON't PANIC! Well, maybe you could panic a little...
- But not a lot!
- So to review: panic some, but not to an extreme level.
- ...starting...
- NOW! What's that you say, Ellen?
- You have amnesia and don't remember me?
- Cool! Talk about a dark cloud having a silver lining! So how did you get your amnesia, Ellen?
-
- She doesn't remember. I've heard that's a symptom. Sorry about your amnesia, Ellen...would you like to go out?
- You know...on a date.
- She's forgotten what dates are. I'm surprised YOU remember. Just how bad is your amnesia?
- I remember othing. Tell me all about yourself.
- Well, there really isn't much to tell...SINCE the last space mission, that is. Please excuse me, whoever you are...I need to go and powder my nose.
- Boy, she really DOES have amnesia, Garfield. What are we gonna do? Amnesia, huh?
- So, she won't remember if she ate her dessert or not... Don't even think about it. Great! I'm finally on a date with Ellen, and she doesn't even know who I am!
- This night could not POSSIBLY get any worse. Wanna bet? I don't believe it!
- Liz is out with another guy!...but why?!
- I bet if I disguise dmyself as a french waiter I could find out what was going on over there.
- But that would be incredibly stupid, wouldn't it? Absolutely.
-
-
- I'm goin' in. My hero! Wood yew lak to or-DARE zee num-nums now? Jon? ...is that you?
- Well...uh...yeah. What gave me away? The bad accent? No...
- Your busboy. Liz, why are you going out with THIS guy? What do you mean, ""THIS GUY""?
- YOU said your social calendar was all booked up...
- I was trying to impress you! Well, I had to go out with SOMEone, didn't I? Hey! I'm SITTING RIGHT HERE! So, wait a minute...you LIKE this guy?
- As a matter of fact, I do. That's right! She does!
- You do? I do. I'm lost here. Need directions? Look, sport, you two go on...she obviously has some sort of weird attraction to you.
- And if THIS lovely lady doesn't mind, I'll buy HER dinner instead!
- Ellen, I'm really sorry... Have we MET? I had a wonderful time tonight, Jon. So did I. And it's my birthday, too.
- Well, happy birthday! * kiss
- did you get something nice? I got a life. And they lived happily ever after. What a night! Did you see the kiss? Yep.
- Well, good night. 'night, Jon.

- I am dreaming, aren't I? Now comes the good part. Garfield, the can opener is broken. Not to worry.
- I've prepared for just such an emergency.
- Is that an acetylene torch? Step away from the can...

- Got a spare wiener on ya? Liz and I are actually going out...I don't think it's really sunk in yet.
-
- YAHHH-HOOOIE!!! Sink, sank, sunk. Having a girlfriend changes everything, Garfield.
- The way things taste, the way things smell.
- I'm gonna have to change my socks more often. Especially the way things smell. Hi, Liz, it's Jon...would you like to go to the movies friday night?
- Yes?
- ...just like that? This will take some getting used to. I'm leaving for my date now. You two WILL behave yourselves, right?
-
- What? What color is the sky in the world you live in, Jon Arbuckle? Two, please. How did Garfield deal with having to stay home tonight, Jon?
- He was pretty broken up about it, but he's gotta learn that you and I need time for ourselves.
- If you'd like pepperoni, press one. I had a great time at the movies with Liz.
-
- I'd forgotten what popcorn without cat hair in it tasted like. Don't get used to it.
-
-
-
-
-
- Windy day. Tell me about it. I'm no expert on anything...
- So, I have nothing to say...
- ...nothing at all... And yet you still keep talking! I'm in the mood to party!
-
- Or fold laundry. There's little difference in Jon's world. I have a scrapbook.
- It's full of things I've clawed.
- Well, it used to be.
- I think it's time we cleaned out the refrigerator. Why the rush?
- The baloney is yodeling. Let's wait for the olives to start blinking. Please wait to be seated
-
- Sit They say talking to plants helps them grow.
- I don't think my elbows match.

- You know what this means, don't you?...
- I have a date for new year's! First things first, pal. Liz likes my smile.
-
- My face hurts. That's the price you pay for love. * RIIING * RIIING * RIIING
- HI, Liz!
- Oh, nothing. Could you do nothing with a towel on? Liz and I are going to the movies on friday.
- It's a chick flick and I don't care.
- So this is love. sniff sniff
- This movie is so sad.
- sniff Hi, mom...guess what? I have a girlfriend!
- Hello? Hello? What happened?
- Mom fainted into her mashed potatoes. I've had dreams like that.

- That was a boring yawn.
- YAWN! Now we're talking! I think I'll stare off into space and daydream.
- Nuts.
- It's a rerun. I'd like to order a large anchovy, onion, and garlic pizza.
- You'll have to quarantine our house?
- Make it an extra-large. NO fear, baby!! WAH HA HA HA HA HA HA!
- snatch
- That's your best driver's license photo yet! Why doesn't your owner let you run free?
- I mangle cats.
- Freedom is overrated. I'm in a really, really bad mood.
-
- Hey, Jon! You gotta see this!
-
-
-
-
- SLAM!
- I guess I don't have to ask how this date went. I wonder what Liz sees in me, Garfield...
- Could it be my rugged-yet-sensitive good looks?
- STOP BITING YOUR LIP! Hi, Liz! ...a what? A veterinary lecture? Tonight?
- Sure! Sounds like fun!
- I wonder what you wear to one of those. A sincere look of feigned interest. I'm looking forward to this lecture tonight, Liz. Really? Most people find them pretty boring.
- Not me! Oh, are you an authority on veterinary medicine?
- No, I'm an authority on boring. I've never been to a veterinary lecture before.
-
- Care for some popcorn? Um...no thanks, sweetie. What's the screen for? This doctor shows slides with his lectures.
- So it's like a show, huh? This oughta be.
- Is that a bowel? Not a healthy one. Liz and I went to dinner, and then to a veterinary lecture.
- It was titled, ""Life cycle of the tapeworm"".
- I shouldn't have ordered the spaghetti. Hungry again, are we?
-
-
-
- Oh, forget it!
- Works every time.
- Hey, mouse, what's shakin'?
- I don't think that's any of your business, fatso.
- Mice are touchy before they've had their morning cheese. Did you ever get a song stuck in your head?
- And you just can't stop humming it?
- If cat food jingles count, yes. I have something to do!
-
- I was lying. Well, that counts as something. Why does your sign say, ""Beware of Cats""?
- Because cats are mean.
- Take it down or I'll beat you with it. SEE? Hey, where's the cake that was in the oven? munch munch
- It hasn't risen yet!
- BA-GOING! NOW you tell me. It looks like you're going to spend all day in bed!
- All right!
- Is this some kind of trick?
-
-
-
-
-
- Garfield, you're not jealous of me seeing Liz, are you?
-
- No?
- Don't flatter yourself. L like Liz a lot, Garfield...
- But I'm not going to rush into anything really serious.
- It's not like I'm ready to show her my sock drawer. You should save that for your wedding night. Liz laughed at all my jokes tonight.
-
- Is it wrong to question her sense of humor? In your case, no. Garfield, now that Jon and I are dating, I hope you and I can be friends.
- That won't be easy.
- It's hard to be friends with someone who's seen you naked. Liz, I really like you. I like you too, Jon.
- I think it's time we took our relationship to the next level. Oh?
- Polka-Karaoke night!! Welcome to our world, baby. Pizza tonight!
- Hey!
- Where did you hid the knobs to the stove?! Make mine half pepperoni, half double pepperoni. PLAY

- Who's eating who NOW, huh, fella? This evening we're featuring ""Winged Things"".
- ""Choice cuts of chicken, turkey, owl, falcon, emu, and penguin"".
- ""Artificial sparrow flavoring added"". That's what gives it its zing. Missing
- Have You Seen Me?
- All right, all right! I ate the last cookie!
- Hey! I wanted a donut, too!
- Very well, you may have the one off the end.
- CLOP
- Ringer!
-
-
-
-
-
- Having a girlfriend has really opened my eyes, Garfield.
- I'm learning so much about women.
- Sorry. Well, I AM! I'd like to make a dinner reservation for two.
- Name's Arbuckle...
- And can I get t table near the giant singing robot mouse? Another date to remember. ...and while my date and I are dining tonight, could you send your strolling violinist over to our table?
- It's his day off?
- Their dishwasher plays the juice harp. Can he stroll? Your restaurant has a WHAT after five? ...
- A dress code?
- Gee, I hope Liz owns a jacket and tie. You DO need to get out more. Jon's out on a date with Liz.
- So we have the place all to ourselves.
- Me, the cookies, and the TV remote. How about a nice walk?
-
- You know how I hate that stare. You know how I hate nice walks.

-
- We'll manage...somehow... What's wrong, Jon? Oh, I feel guilty about leaving Garfield and Odie alone.
- That's sweet. I can just see them, waiting at the door for me...
- Z You shouldn't feel guilty about leaving your pets alone for the evening, Jon. I can't help it.
- I keep thinking about their sad little faces.
- Oh, Garfield, I'm such a loser. Guys! I'm back from my date! Did you miss me?
-
- Can you PAUSE the video game for a second?! I guess you two DON'T mind my going out on dates then.

- Hmm...
- I'm thinking something with feelers. Well, looky here! A chinese takeout menu! Guess what, Garfield? Steamed vegetables for dinner!
-
- Now that's just crazy talk, and you know it. You're not purring. Tah-dah!
- I saw this on a cooking show!
- Are you sure it wasn't a murder mystery? This soup is from an old family recipe.
- Grandma named it after the chicken who inspired it.
- ""Cream of Gladys"". And blooey goes the ol' appetite. Tah-dah!
- GULP snatch
- I spent all day making that! You've really got to learn to cook faster.

- Something that speaks from my heart...
- Accordion lessons? Try another organ. Let's see...could you picture your girlfriend in this, sir?
- Sir?
- Okay now, open up...here comes the choo-choo... Well, I decided. Liz said she like dpoetry, so I got her a book by Emily Dickinson.
-
- I also got her the singing fish. You had me worried for a minute there. Sigh...it's almost that time of year again.
- Soon the snow will be falling...
- And the Christmas cookies will be rising. Here they come...
- Christmas cookies!
- Shaped like little harried last-minute shoppers. Let's put them out of their misery. It's a Christmas card from our cable company.
- Interesting illustration...
- Santa beating a satellite dish with a giant candy cane.
- Daer Santa, My name is Jon.
- I have been good all year.
- My dog, Odie, has been good all year.
- And my cat, Garfield,
-
- says, ""Hi."" It's one of those snowing-outside, toasty-warm-inside evenings...
- Perfect for curling up with a good book.
- I thought I'd start my Christmas cards early this year!
-
- I don't believe me either. Race you to the couch. Think we should send Mrs. Feeny a Christmas card?
-
- It IS the holiday season, you know. Can't we just flock her chihuahua instead? Happy Holidays, from Jon, Garfield and Odie
- Happy Jonnydays, from Hol, Oldfield and Garil.
- Time for a little break. Hippy Frollijons, Garfield! Stop trying to peek at your presnets!
- And by the way, those don't really work.

- She'a bringing some of her special holiday fudge. Don't you ever lose this woman. This is fun, Jon. What would you like to do for dinner?
- Why don't we just order chinese food and watch an old Christmas movie o TV?
- He gets emotional around the holidays, doesn't he? Actually, I think it was the chinese food that did it. Jon...your couch is covered in cat hair!
- I like that in a man.
- You can't have her anymore. *I* love her.
- Hey, pal...
- Who told you horizontal stripes were flattering?
- Guess what, Garfield?

- 'sup? Oh, my brother-in-law's been visiting all month.
- What did you ask for from Santa? For you to eat him.

- How did you know? ""Polka Joe, Live at the Aztec Bowling Alley"". C'mon, Garfield, just one picture in the sweater mom made for you.
- Hold still now...I want this to be good.
- Are you smiling? Take a wild guess. I invited Liz over for new year's eve!
-
- We're gonna need a bigger couch. Party hats...check. Noisemakers...check. Punch...check. Lampshade...
- Lampshade? Check. Garfield! Liz isn't even here yet!
- Stay out of the dip! Sheesh.
- Some party THIS is.

- 4...3...2...1... Here it comes!
- HAPPY NEW YEAR! Z We ought to make new year's resolutions.
- HA HA HA HA HA
- No, seriously. Please, let's not spoil the moment. For new year's, why don't you resolve to lose 50 pounds?
- And why don't you resolve to stop being a dork?
- I'm only kidding. I'm not. I put my pants on backwards again.
- RATS!
- And anothe rnew year's resolution goes blooey. Liz has some leftover holiday fudge she's bringing over.
-
- SOME people do HAVE leftover fudge. What a concept. Liz is bringing fudge over...
- Jon likes Liz, Liz likes Jon, and I like fudge.
- This could be the start of something beautiful. Thanks for the fudge, Liz. Garfield thanks you too.
- He's very loving. Well, it IS Garfield...
- I've never had a cat kiss my feet before. And it IS fudge.

- Sometimes I envy dogs...
- STOP SHEDDING!
- Whoa! That loosened up some hair! I'm a cat hair.
- I'm a cat.

- You call THAT a PLAN?! I'd run NOW, Trent. Paddles and cookies?
- What are those for? My snow fly.
- I found a quarter in the dryer!
-
- It was already yours, tycoon boy. What's it all mean, Garfield? What's life all about?

- Sort of like a chili dog in an elevator. I love cili dogs. ""Surprise your loved one with this special gift that will last for all eternity"".
-
- ""Comes with a free 30-day warranty"". Eternity ain't what it used to be. Liz and I have been together almost six whole months now.
- That's the longest I've ever been with a girl.
- Moms don't count. Of course, if I don't count mom... I know just what to do for Liz on our anniversary, Garfield.
- I'll take her to ""our"" restaurant and have the band play ""our"" song.
- It'll be perfect. Binky Burger has a band? How about dinner tomorrow, Liz? ...it's a special night, you know.
-
- She said every night with me is special. You're melting. Garfield! Garfield, guess what I got Liz for our six-month anniversary...
- Lovebirds!
- They represent Liz and me, and the little bells symbolize the beautiful music we make together! Check out the chubbo. You said it.
- Well, I better get ready for my date.

- Seem, the twom um, earrings represent you and me, and the little bells symbolize

-
- I tried it, but I still don't get it. Hey...
- Where's my ball of yarn?
- You mean dad?
- I never get a call on my cell phone.
- Possibly because it's an electric razor. Cats live on instinct.

- Was the store out of hams? I could use a hug. You got it!
- Odie! snap
- Uh, thanks, Garfield. Feel the love. I'd like a bouquet of roses.
- stomp! stomp! stomp!
- And to pay for the daisies in your window display. That was invigorating! Breakfast, lunch and dinner are three SEPARATE meals.
- They are NOT intended to run together.
- Do you just make this stuff up to depress me? I'm Maynard, from the temporary cat services.
- I'll be filling in for Garfield while he takes a little personal time.
- I was told there would be food. Go away. I'm not having fun. You're not?
- SLAP OW!
- That wasn't fun! Then I'm out of ideas.

- Do let me know when you've hit bottom. I could use a lantern down here! Liz and I are going out again...
- And this time I've hired a pet sitter.

- Well, hel-* LOOOOO!
- My, you must be one of those HAIRless kitties! She could burn ants with those lenses. Now don't you worry about a thing, Mr. Lardmuckle. We'll be just fine.
- If you get worried, just give me a call. Thanks...I might.
- I'll have the phone beside me all night. You are so gonna pay for this. I bet ol' Miss Lillian knows what you two darlings want...homemade cookies!

- Dust bunny surprise.
- What's a ""dust bunny""? And why are the floors cleaner than usual? Irma, the men's room is out of soap. Thanks, hon.

- I love that. And I'm sure you get to see it a lot when she's with you. Sigh...love is just so great...
- I love love.
- Where are you going? Outside. This hairball's gonna be a whopper. I just got my shirt back from the cleaners and it's kinda snug. It has a name tag.

- And she says it's not just a weight issue...it's a health issue.
- So is STARVING! What's with that weird look?
- Are you obsessing about food again? No...

- I'm hallucinating...
- That ain't right. Hey, cat...how's it going? I'm starving!
- Sorry to hear that.
- Diet's starting to get to you, huh? EAT ME Jon told me this diet has been pretty hard on you.

- Well, she's funnier, better looking, and a better cook than you...
- She's a keeper. You on the other hand... Garfield, I feel down.
- Let's take a moment to think happy thoughts!
- Did you say happy or stupid? I need guidance.
- You're lazy.
- I need guidance on where to get a long stick so I can hit Jon without getting up. sigh...
- Pooky, you're my best friend.
- You're always there for me.

- You AND Odie. Scram, this is my jealous tantrum.
- Odie, do you like Liz?
-
- I mean, Jon really seems to like her a LOT...do you like her a lot?
-
-
- And do you like boiled pig snouts with cabbage in mystery gravy? I don't want you to be jealous og me, Garfield.
- Don't you think it's possible for you and me to share Jon? Well...okay.
- You take the half that kisses, and I'll take the half that feeds. Garfield and I talked, Jon. We're friends now!

- Whoa...
- You guys will sniff pretty much anything, won't you? I guess I'll just have to face facts...
- I may never reach my full potential.
- And just WHY is that funny? How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.
- Polite AND tasty. I'm afraid there's been no word from the governor, Rocky...looks like this is it.
- What do you want for your last meal? Gimme a cheeseburger.
- And would you like that (hee hee) for here or to (snort) go? Rocky's not smiling.
- Sigh...
- I hope this isn't one of those moments we'll always remember.
- I think I'll change again and go for another dip in our kiddie pool.

-
- All right, hand it over. What duct tape? Friday night? ...your treat? ...that sounds great!
- Wow! LIZ asked ME out on a date!
- Is that allowed? Better check the rule book. I want to smell good for my date with Liz... ""Midnight Mama's Boy"".
- Which cologne should I use? ""Polyester Passion"".
- How about ""Eau de Slide Rule""? Why don't you just roll in something with Odie? Hi, Liz! So what's the plan? I thought we'd go for some italian food...
- And then visit the aquarium.
- This is MY date, Garfield. You get your own girl. How's your pasta, Liz?
- Delicious. How's yours?
- I have no idea.
- Garfield, we haven't even ordered yet...
- Don't fill up on bread!
-
-
- What?!
- Garfield? Fill up? Good point. Keep 'em coming! Three tickets for the aquarium, please. I'm sorry, ma'am...
- But you'll have to leave that outside.
- Hand over the harpoon, Garfield. Party pooper. I can't see the fish. This is a very rare species.
- They can be pretty shy.
- It's probably hiding. I'm sorry about your date tonight, Liz. It was different.
- I've never seen a restaurant run out of food before. That happens to us all the time.
- And I've never been thrown out of an aquarium. That too. Don't feel bad about the date Jon...I had a great time.
- So did I. BURP
- And so did Garfield. Kiss her, stupid, before the moment passes. Garfield, I can't get out of this hammock!
-
- -and I'm LOVING it! Atta boy.
- HAAAACK
- You're gonna need some traffic cones for that one. Hmmm...
- What kind of dog ARE you anyway, Odie?
- Bulldog?...
- Pointer?...
- Sheep doog?...
- Basset houn.
- Ah, here you are...purebred clown. * honk honk I finally found a way to keep cool, Garfield.
- I put a frozen chicken down my pants!
- It won't thaw for hours! I won't be here when it does. I can't stand this hot weather anymore!
-
- Garfield, are you sitting in the ice cream again? It's okay! It's just the rum raisin! It's so hot.
- Ice cube shirt!
- Could Jon be getting smarter? Fishing isn't that hard.
- Just rear back and flick it.
- Then scream till help comes. LIFEGUARD!!!
- I'M STANDING IN SEAWEED!!
- Let's go home now. I hear that stuff's good for your complexion. I love a deserted beach, Garfield.
- No crowds...
- No hassles. No one to make him eat sand. XAN'S Cafe Caffeine
- You know, this coffee bar is a nice place.
- Very cosmopolitan...a really hip clientele...
- And these cafe lattes are pretty darn good.
- SLURP
- I don't know why we don't go out more often. I do. I've gotta admit...
- That moosehead towel rack looks GREAT in the bathroom.
- Really goes well with the snakeskin shower curtain. We're BACHELORS, baby.
- Awwwww... Iz da widdle kitty hungwee?
- Reckon so. Moring. Morning.

- I think the toaster has a short. So now all of a sudden you're an electrician? Look at those cute squirrels in the driveway.

- Looks like they're hocking your hubcaps for pistachios. HEY! Boy, the meat counter was practically sold out!
- I was lucky to get anything at all.
- So how do you like your yak rump? There ain't enough ketchup in the world. Check it out...

- I'm in deep, aren't I? Right up to the gills, arabesque boy. So long, boys...be good tonight. Have a nice taime at the ballet!
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- Garfield was teasing me about going to the ballet. Why?
- I think only a REAL man would be comforatble enought to bring me here.
- GO, SWANS! How was *I* to know the ballet was so stuffy?!
- And what's WRONG with a little audience participation, anyway?!
- Only Jon would take a dick call to ""Swan Lake"". Stupid usher!
- Yes, I KNOW it's almost dinnertime!
- And bring my watch back! Aloha!
- I thought I'd go with a luau theme tonight.
- Although the grass skirt is kind of itchy. What you can't see can't yourt you.

- And here's my date and me at the junior prom. Whoa!
- So the pig turned you down? Here's Doc Boy and me back on the farm.
- We were very close.
- You know how brothers are. Yeah, but sharing a pair of overalls? My uncle Roy was very wise.
- One day he took me aside and said, ""Son...""
- ""Don't put your head under the tractor"". If only Jon had listened. Ready for my family reunion, Garfield?
- Just ignore my uncle Bill.
- He'll want you to wear his teeth. Shoot me. A smile is like sunshine... Just like my uncle Leo.
- A ray of joy... He always had a smile.
- To share with the world. Till that little incident with the denture weevils. There's Mr. Greiwe, washing his car...
- There's old Man Barnard, cleaning his gutters...
- And there's Mrs. Feeny, stringing barbed wire around her yard. I tihnk the woman secretly loves me.

- ""You are kind loving, creative, and origina. Good things are being said about you...""
- ""...sunshine, happiness, great success, and true love all await you in the near future...""
- ""...you are wonderful beyond measure, and everyone treasures you dearly"".
- Kind of flowery, but not bad. Now let's see what MINE says... crack
- ""It stinks to be you"". I like mine better.
- Hey, Liz.
- Nice legs. If you're a piano. A new bakery just opened near my house.
- I think Garfield is noticing.
- You smell like cinnamon rolls, my dear. I really like Jon.
- Ah, I see...
- How many fingers am I holding up? Do you get a lot of headaches? You know what's fun?
- What? Chewing bubble gum!
- Is that more fun than kissing? Who said that?! Liz, is my tie on straight?
- It leans a little right.
- How about now? Polly wants a cracker.
-
- Here you go, Polly.
- Why do cats climb trees?
- Is it instinct?

- Well, let's go in!

- My manservant, Troglo, will show you your tombs.
- Um,I mean, rooms. I wouldn't eat the mints on the pillows! So nice of you to join me for the dinner, my dear.
- Why, thank you for having me, Mr. Count. Not at all. Please pass your neck.
- Beg pardon? The plot thickens... Hold very still, Bernice! Maybe the monster won't see you! Okay, Trevor.

- I ate all the marshmallows.
- And there's no such things as ghosts. Hey! Who ate all the marshmallows? Odie is very loyal.
-
- And I'm not sure if that's good or bad. Well, Garfield, the laundry is done!
- Every article of clothing ironed, folded, and put away.
- Sigh... His life is over. Why so gloomy, Jon? The world is full of wonderful things!
- Like my tuna breath!
- And nice comfortable floors! bip bip boop boop bip

- When Jon gives me presents...
- Instead of me just taking his stuff. So what do YOU want for Christmas?

- Most people circle things in catalogs. Garfield tabs things in cookbooks. You have to behave around Christmas.
- Santa might be watching.
- Or one of his spies. Fa-la-la-fa-la!

- She's renting a chick flick on the way over...
- I'll make hot cocoa, and we'll watch it here on the couch...
- And share a tub of ice cream and a box of tissues together.
-
- What are you doing? Waving bye-bye to your manhood. What would you like for Valentine's Day, Liz?
- REally?
- She'd like me. See, this is how those big nasty hairballs start. I'm looking through a veterinary supply catalog for a Valentine's Day gift for Liz.
- Hmmm...
- Think she'd appreciate an electric probe warmer? I know I would. I was going to make Liz a Valentine's Day card...
- But I can't cut out a paper heart to save my life!
- Maybe I could substitute another organ. ""I love you with all my spleen"". Happy Valentine's Day, Jon. Happy Valentine's Day, Liz.
-
- What did you get your wife for Valentine's Day, Hank? A bouquet of dead gnats.
- Wow, that must have cost you plenty! Yeah, it did.
- It cost me an arm and a leg, and a leg, and a leg, and a... If you work hard, you can achieve success.

- And while you're doing that, I can raid your refrigerator! Greetings!
- I'm the big fat onion slice you ate on your hamburger last night...

- In the future, would you recommend me to a friend? To an enemy, maybe...
- And would you ever choose to eat me again?
- Well?
- WHOOOOOO Open a window. Penny for your thoughts.
- Garfield, I was thinking...if our ears were in our armpits...
- Would we have to raise our arms to hear people talk? A dollar for not thinking. Did a lube job and oil change, and took her for a test spin.
- She's all set!
- We have the best-maintained can opener on the block. What's that smell?
- I have no idea.
- But if you'd like, I could ask my friend, Mr. Seven-Month-Old-Head-Of-Cabbage. Z

- If you're good at it, you don't have to point it out. What was that?
- I thought I heard something. Oh, that...
- That was just the sound of my life force being sucked into a shrieking vortex of infinite boredom. There it is again. It feels good lying here, but I'm hungrym and there's a good show on TV...

- But I still haven't found anything that rhymes with...
- PHHHHHHHHT You are so ungrateful.
- You don't even appreciate the little chocolate mints I leave in your bed. Mints?
- What mints? The archaeologist removes a thin layer of sediment... wisk wisk wisk
- And oh, look...
- A fossil. How'd you like an ancient curse, pal? I'm going running.
- And I'll stay here and eat the donuts.

- Dribbling. Look, Garfield, a paper bag! Cats love to hide in them!
-
- Get in the bag! I knew this would turn ugly. They say cats have nine lives. gulp smack slurp smack

- SLAP! Come on, Liz, I'm not THAT bad of a housekeeper.
- Jon, there are COBWEBS in your dishwasher.
- That's because there's still room in the SINK! The bathroom sink, anyway. Honestly, Jon, when was the last time you even vacuumed?
-
- What is this ""vacuum"" thing of which you speak? Come on, say it with me...""I need to clean my house"".
- Guh...bah..duhh...
- I...need... Dhay..bwah...gwah.. In case you wondered why I never married... Maybe Liz is right. Maybe this place COULD use a good cleaning...
-
- And maybe chickens say ""moo"". We're BACHELORS, baby. I guess I'd better dust first.
- How hard could THAT be?
- PSHHHHHT M...Ma...Maids. Guess what, Liz? I cleaned the whole house by myself!
- Yup...even dusted our pizza-box tower in the living room!

- Nature has way too much green on it.

- Is that not *the* most disgusting thing you've ever see...
- No. *That* is. mmmmm Hey, there's Arlene...
- SUUUUUCK
- Are you feeling okay? Not really. But how do I look? Arlene! Fancy meeting you here!
- I always dine Alfresco on tuesday nights. You do?
- Sure. It's trash night. I hope they serve mints. Garfield, you like me, don't you` Sure.
- By the way, you're sitting in my spot.
- I like you too, Garfield. So how's domestic life treating you, Garfield? Awful!
- Jon used too much oregano in the lasagna tonight...
- I grieve for you, Garfield. It's a jungle in there, Arlene. Don't you hate being an alley cat, Arlene?
- ...don't you have to live with a *dog*?
- Sure is a quiet night. All you think about is yourself, Garfield.
- That's not true!

- Hi, Jon, it's Liz. I can't decide what to wear tonight.
- At first I thought my blue dress would be perfect, but then I decided my red top and skirt would look even better...
- Then I couldn't find any shoes to go with *that*, so I switched to the green cocktail dress, but the zipper on that was stuck...
- So I tried the purple strapless gown on, but the clutch purse that goes with it has a huge mascara smudge on it, and besides, I still think it makes my hips look big...
- So now I'm back to the dress, unless I can find a way to make that red top and skirt work with sandals, or something open-toed in a neutral color.
- What are you wearing? My suit. Hurray for guys. Hey, what are you looking at, fuzzball? Lunch, if you don't can the attitude.
- Ha! I eat cats like you for breakfast! Oh, yeah?
- ? Prove it! Nermal, have you ever had cosmetic surgery? Can you keep a secret?
- Yes. See this eyelash?
- Yessss?... *That's* real. Garfield, have *you* ever thought about cosmetic surgery? What, improve on *this*?
-
- That has to be the best straight line you've ever given me. It was a accident, okay? You're not so cute.
-
- Eww, yes you are. Why, thank you. You think *you're* the only one who can look cute?
- Check *this* out!
- You call *that* cute? Wait, wait. I'm a little out of practice. Don't hate me because I'm cute.
- -I' m getting tired of replacing that door. Try spackle. BAM! BAM!
- BAM! BAM! Garfield!
- BAM! BAM! BAM! Garfield, open the door!
- Garfield!! My arms are full of groceries!
-
- Well! It's about...
- ...time. Oooh, cookies! Water $20
- Nobody's going to pay that.
- Free cup of salt? This is Larry...he'll be interning for the summer. 'sup, man?
- WHACK!
- OW! That HURT! He's young. He'll learn.
- Just go away. Dogs...
-
- THUD They aren't real good at sharp turns.
-
- That's a lot of sausages. That's so I can find my way back to the butcher shop. Hey, Garfield! Come and see!
-
- Not particularly moved by sunrises, are we? I would like to dedicate this next number to my idol.
- BLAAAATTPP
- Obviously, my idol does not play the trumpet.
- You're really attached to Garfield, aren't you?
- We've been together a long time.
- Just like an old married couple.
-
- A looooonnnnng time. SLAP! And what's *that* supposed to mean?!
- I think I'll check the roast. I want a divorce! I get ther fridge. Yep, your birthday's coming. Calendars don't lie. Have you thought about what you want? Yes I have...
- But, oh, wait! They haven't invented time machines yet, have they?! Don't let this birthday thing get you down, Garfield.
- Hey, your age is only a number...right?
- A big honking number. The ears still work, by the way. Hey, geezer.
- I hear your birthday cake is coming with a smoke alarm!
- That spider looks like it's laughing. Get me a ladder and a bat. Another birthday...maybe it's time to start thinking about my future.
- Time to start making some plans...
- Time to put that new hip on layway. So *that's* why cats eat mice. clack clack clack clack clack clack
- clack clack clack clack clack
- I am NOT OLD! Have you thought about what kind of birthday cake you want?
-
- Besides ""large""? There's another kind?
-
- POOMP
-
-
- BOOT!
- It's tough getting old. Only three more days...
- And you'll be a year older.
- Sez you! Garfield's birthday is coming up.
- Presents, presents, and more presents!
- What do you get for the cat who wants everything? Tomorrow is my brthday...
- This year I shall celebrate in an age-appropriate manner. Cool!
- I *love* musical wheelchairs! In the minus column, there's loss of memory, loss of hair, acquisition of nose and ear hair, liver spots, wrinkles, achy joints, and saggy skin.
- In the plus column: cake.
- No contest. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Hi, Liz! Hello, Jon.
- Wow! What smells so good? My perfume?
- Mmmmm...beef... Ah, that would be my *other* perfume. Whoo! Am I full! What a meal that was! pat pat pat
- Boy, that liz sure can cook!
- Wanna smell my beef breath? You're a cruel, cruel man.
- Welcome to the All-Mime Channel.
-
-
-
- And now a word from our sponsor.
- Jon's washing his car.
- All done!
- Well, *that* was aggravating.
- I got one of those shopping carts with a weird wheel.
- I had to shop in circles for an hour. I hope it was in the donut aisle.
- How was the meat loaf? Great!
- BLEAH! Wow.
-
- There sure is a lot of napping going on. Wanna bat me around? Nah...I don't feel like it.
- A little Macrame then, perhaps? Okay, now you're *really* reaching. Supergarfield stands for truth...
- Justice...
- And shedding!
- Arlene's coming this way!
- She'll try to flirt with me, like she always does.
- It's pathetic, really...
- Act like you don't even notice her, Garfield.
- Poor, needy thing. Isn't this great, Garfield? Wonderful.
- Here we are, back on the farm! Yee-ha.
- I'm gonna go hug a cow! Long time, no date. Who are you? I'm a barn cat.
- I'm Garfield. I'm Barney.
- Where do you live? Okay, Flash, let's start again... What are you? I'm a chicken.
- Riiiight...
- If you're a chicken, where's the breading? Kids, farms are where we get our food.
- Cereal, fruit, vegetables...
- Excuse me, sir. Where might I find the whipped cream trees? Looks like rain. Yup.
- Yup. Yup.
- Yup, yup. Yup, yup, yup. And they say the art of conversation is dead. One of the best things about the farm is all the *nature*...
- It's *everywhere*!
- Like under your shoe.
- Jon, you need to rethink your wardrobe. I do?
- Come on, we'll start by going through your closet.
- Hmmm...let's see...well, this has to go...oh, ick, and this, too... But I love that shirt!
- And this, and this, and this, and this, and WHAT is THAT?! THAT?
- YEEEEEEEEEK!!! Poor thing.
- She found the powder blue polyester leisure suit. It still fits! We've been together a long time, Garfield. Long time.
- Remember the good old days? That's not what I'd call them.
- Remember when I got the brussels sprout stuck in my navel? Those were the STUPID old days. Hey, Garfield, you know that checkout lane at the grocery store for 10 items or less?
- Well, Sir, I made it through with 12, count em', *12* items!
- One small step for man, one giant leap for nerdkind. I like to think I'm unique.
-
- Believe me, Jon, we *all* like to think you're unique. Through the dragon's nose, over the moat under the castle, and into the hole!
- WHACK! -Over the dragon, under the lights, through the snack bar, and into a fat lady's chilli dog. FORE! Let's see, that's another hole in one for me...
- And another hole in one for you, too, Garfield.
- And where's Jon? He's still cursing out the plaster pirate on thirteen. Jon suspects nothing.
-
- Darn guard sock puppet.
-
-
-
-
-
- I don't think I'm getting enough rest.
- Not to worry!
- I'll pick up the slack. I don't suppose you'll be moving today?
- I don't suppose you'd care to get some exercise?
- I don't suppose you'd care to go outside?! I don't suppose you see any wheels on this bed? Two days, and you haven't so much as moved an Eyelid!
- That must take some willpower. Au contraire.
- MOVING required willpower. Day three, and you still haven't moved. Aren't you afraid of losing muscle tone?
-
- Sorry, stupid question. I'll say. I had trouble sleeping.
-
- I tossed and turned all afternoon. Z
- Wake up!
- Didn't I do that yesterday?
- And now we have a dedication...
- This one goes out to Liz...
- ...from her boyfriend Joh, with all the love in his heart.
- So here it is, Liz, just for you...a little something called...
- ""You're the rooty-tooty cross-eyed cutie who put the oom in my oom-pa-pa.""
- RING That would be Liz telling me how much she loves the song! Especially the Kazoo solo. All is well in my world.
- STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- Except for the whole cats-wearing-boots thing.
-
- I don't believe it!
- Liz is out with another guy!... But why?!
- I bet if I disguised myself as a french waiter I could find out what was going on over there.
- But that would be incredibly stupid, wouldn't it? Absolutely.
-
-
- I'm going in. My hero! You're at the top of my hate list, FATSO!
- SMACK
- Right up there with magazines! Okay, men!
- HEAVE...HO!!!
- This does not bode well... Bring in the giant cactus plant!
- SMACK!
- For this, I went to college?
- I hope you're not planning a fancy surprise party for my birthday.
- Fancy?
- tap tap
- FWEEEEEEP
- NOTHING'S too fancy for our Jon. Z
- Awwww. Z
- He remembered my birthday. Z Liz took me out to a nice restaurant for my birthday.
- A *really* nice restaurant.
- ...*glass* catsup bottles! Fancy-schmancy. There's nothing like a fresh vegetable.
- And let's keep it that way!
- Who's that? That's my neighbor, Mrs. Feeny.
-
- Why is she digging a moat around her house? I have my suspicions... Liz paid for our date last night.
- That made me feel a little weird.
- It was a *good* weird, though. Free weird is a good weird. Jon and I make a nice couple, don't you think, Garfield?
- Yes. Sort of like the way Argyle socks and polka-dotted bow ties go toghether.
- I sense sarcasm in that smile. You're getting to know me. Hey!
- I've got *news* for you, buddy...
- You're not so smart!
- You're...not...so...smart! poke poke poke
- What do you think of *that*?
-
- ZIP I bought Liz a dozen roses today...for no reason at all!
- I bet she'll be so surprised...
- FOR FIFTY BUCKS, SHE'D BETTER!!! A fleeting moment of male clarity. Oooh, Flowers! Yeah, I got them from my latin dance instructor, Raoul.
- Oh... Kidding! They're for you, hon.
- Oh! I haven't tangoed since the Eisenhower administration. Look, flowers! Liz sent *me* flowers!
-
- Is that even legel? Better draw the blinds. Thanks for the flowers, Liz! You're welcome, Jon.
- They were great.
- ""Were""? Were. BURP Okay, who had the coffees?
- Um... Just a little coffee-bar humor, Sir.
- That guy always looks so sad. Your tips could make Binky the Clown sad. I'm back from the store!
- sklish sklish sklish sklish sklish sklish
- The sprayers in the produce aisle got me again. In the right light, you do resemble a giant brussels sprout. boop
- Hello?...Liz?!---Sorry. I must have pushed your speed-dial number by mistake!
- I was calling to order a pizza...say, would you like to join us?...Great!
- Sure, pick up a movie on the way over! We'll make a night of it!
- Wow, I couldn't have planned that better if I'd tried!
-
- WHOP! goiyoiyoiyoing! Order the pizza! Odie, fetch me a pizza.
-
- This is one of the good dreams.
- Hmmm.
- Funny leftovers or pizza? Just dial. I'm going to order a pizza.

- And I can do it without the pompons. Oh, c'mon...gimme a ""p"". Frank's pizza? This is Jon Arbuckle...I'd like to order my usual.
- Oh.

- You're fat.
- I'm too generous. Ahem.
- I am not too fat!
- And I am not sensitive about my weight! I'm fat.

- Hey, Ham, where's Catsup? Running late.
- Late again?! My *ice* is melting! Cool down, Pops...
- We're *sick* of him *never* being on time for meals! Right *on*, frenchy!
- Where's my *lunch*?! It couldn't wait.
- CRACK!
- You must diet now. Be a pal and slide some food down here. You should eat a little less at each meal.
- I could do that, I suppose.
- Of course, it would mean doubling up on the snacks! Did you ever stop to think that you might eat so much because of some emotionel need?
- ...that you eat to compensate for some inner need? Of course.
- It's called hunger, you dipstick. I know it's hard, but try not to think of food.
- Try to visualize a peaceful meadow... I see it.
- Under a tree, sits a beautiful girl... Wearing a dress made of bacon. I'm not fond of salads...
- And they hate me.
- DOINK! Stop throwing croutons at me! How to lose weight

- This lousy diet has me seeing things again...
- You're a diet hallucination, aren't you?! Okay, sport. You got me.
- GURGLE URGLE URGLE ORGLE URGLE
- I wonder what diet hallucinations taste like. Chicken! If you lost a little weight...
- ...you'd still be fat. All right!
- Dieting is futile! Liz is going to call me!
-
- Any hour now! Be sure to tell her how pathetic you are. RING
- Meow!
- That was Liz. She wanted to talk to you, but I meowed her out of it. I wonder what Liz is doing right now...
- And now...
- And now... WHAN WHAM WHAM WHAM Would you like to go dancing saturday night, Jon?
- WOULD I?
- Would I? As long as I don't have to watch. Fish are fascinating to watch.
- Like when they're in a frying pan!
- I assume you are taking that to the kitchen? RIING
- Jon, I have to break our date. We just had an emergency case come into clinic. That's okay, Liz. I understand.
- Well, pal, no date. I guess it's just you and me tonight.
-
-
- Boy, does this ever bring back memories, huh? Like a three-day-old taco. Garfield!
- A mouse! Correct.
- You *do* know your rodents.

- I think I'm losing my touch. GOOD Morning! YOU'RE up early.
- I haven't even made your breakfast. I think I'll skip it and go jogging.
- Oh, goody! Tomorrow's monday!
-
- pat pat pat
- This has got to be the worst nightmare I ever had. Do you remember my old girlfriend Ingrid? Nope.
- ...the one with the bulging biceps? Not at all.
- ...the cat hugger? Like it was yesterday. Remember my old girlfriend Jodell?
- You know...the psycho?
- You'll have to be more specific. Do you remember my old girlfriend Loretta? No.
- The one with the huge buckteeth? You know I'm terrible with names.
- She could open a can with her overbite. Oh, yeah...utensil face! Remember my old girlfriend Rhonda? Nope.
- She was all kinda stooped over?... Nope.
- ...and had the giant sloping forehead, Cro-Magnon brow and bad teeth? Oh, yeah. The hand model. Do you remember Myrna, that girl I took out once?
- The one with the humongous nostrils?
- That's an understatement. I never did find my keys that night. Remember my old girlfriend Griselda?
- The one with the bulging jaw muscles?...
- Boy, could she ever put away a rack of ribs. Why you let her get away, I will never know. Guess who's here?
- We're kitten-sitting Nermal today, Garfield!
- You two play nice together.
- So what should we play? How about hide and seek?
- Okay!
-
- What are you doing? Winning. I'm sorry, Sir, but a coat and tie are required for dinner.
-
- DON'T YOU GET ANY GRAVY ON THOSE! It says here a guy ate twenty pounds of baked beans.
- In just fifteen Minutes.
- Doesn't say what he won, though. Probably not any new friends. Jon, this restaurant we're going to...is it fancy? Sort of.
- Should I wear my little black dress? ...Hello? He says yes. Psst! Liz! Which fork do I use? The salad fork.
- Oh.
- Psst! I'm back from my dinner date!
- Look, Odie! I brought you a doggie bag!
- And here's you kittie bag. That's all? I was feeling so manly today, then I had to go and stub my toe.
- ...cried like a baby...
- Wanna see my boo-boo? Frm manly to sissy, just like that. Of course I'm still seeing Jon...
- Things are going well, mother...he took me to a restaurant last night...
- This place was *fancy*, Mom! Cloth napkins, three forks, no flies on the salad bar...
- ...and a strolling violinist! Jon requested a special song just for us...
- ...can you *believe* he didn't even know ""Turkey in the Straw""?!
- ...and how's *this* for romantic...he ordered in *french*!
- What did he eat? He thinks it was a weasel with cheese. I heard from my cousin Kenny today. Kenny?
- You know, the one with the botched facelift? I know a lot og Kennys.
- Looks like this? Ah, *that* Kenny? There are my frat buddies in college.
- We had some great times.
- Good ol' ""Ph Ama Geeka"". Is that a keg of herbal tea? My frat brothers were real practical jokers.
- It was all innocent fun, though.
- That's me, asleep, with a chicken glued to my forehead. Hang on, I'm writing this down. Here I am in the homecoming parade.
- I got to dress up and ride on the float my fraternity built.
- That's the biggest pocket protector I've ever seen. I'm the third mechanical pencil from the left. There's Doc Boy with his girlfriend. And there he is with his prize pig!
-
- I think I have those in backward. Hard to tell...they're both wearing ribbons. Remember my old girlfriend Babette? I'm not sure.
- I think she was on the rebound. Oh, yeah...
- She wore that oil painting of her ex-boyfriend around her neck. Biggest locket I ever saw. z

- OOOOF
- You used to purr when I entered the room.
- BURP
- You call *that* a *purr*?
- You call that an entrance?
-
- You're right, Odie. That other dog *is* stupid looking.
-
- And just what...? Did you know people feed ducks in the park?
- Well!
- Looks like *some*one had a good night. I had a suicidal giant cookie dream again. Mmm! These Escargots are good! You have a very sophisticated palate, Sir.
- Hmm? Not everyone appreciates the fine taste of snails.
- PHHHHHT Eww...ick! Get away!
- Help! Affectionate dog!
-
- I am a headless swamp monster!
- Fear me! Maybe later.
- I am an invisible vampire! Good for you.
- RAAAAWWWHHHR! Do tell.
- EEK!
- My dish is empty!
-
- I'll never eat an entire plate of Jalapeno poppers before bed again.
-
- Do us all a huge favor and wake up. Weird dream, huh? You said it.
- Tell me, is it yours or mine? I'm not sure.
- ...or theirs.
-
- You know, once I had a dream where I could fly... Is it morning yet?
-
-
-
- Loved your pie!
- I saw you on the fence with Arlene last night.
- In fact, you've been out there *every* night this week...
- Could love be in the air? That is none of your business.
- Hey Arlene. Couldn't stay away, huh?
- You know what I like. Come a little closer.
- Got any jelly-filled? Just glazed tonight. I'll walk you to your car, Liz...
- Oh, Jon, you're such a perfect gentleman! kiss
- Oh, Jon, you're such a perfect gentleman! Jealus
- No Dogs Allowed
- Meow! Hi, I'm your friendly neighborhood flea.
- Hey, little fella. Excuse me just for a moment.
- Do we have any dynamite? I may just blow off this entire day and do nothing.
- What do you think? Sure...
- Come on in, the lethargy's fine. Oooh, Jon! They have *oysters* here! Oysters?
- Let's order some! Um, sure.
- So how was your date?
- What's with the cupcake?
- It's the leftover meat loaf's birthday! Frank! ...are you listening to me?!...
- Frank, I've had it with you! Don't start with me...I'm not in the mood.
- All you do is sit around and suck blood all day! Hey! I'm a flea! Excuse me for making me a living!
- I should have married Arnie Aphid...at least he bought me roses! Oh, here we go...Arnie Aphid! Arnie Aphid! The men's a garden pest, Francise!
- I'm going home to mother! Fine by me!
- SLAM!
- Mom, I've left Frank. What took you so long? Slam? Hi, Dad?... It's Jon! Hold on a minute, son.
- SQUAWK! CHOP
- I'm helping your mother fix dinner. Sounds farm fresh. You'd like my girlfriend, Dad. She's great with animals!
- I don't know...I'll have to ask her.
- How fast can you pluck a chicken? Dad, I asked my girlfriend, and though she never tried it...
- She thinks she could pluck a chicken in about half an hour.
- ...Dad? Are you sure enough she's good enough for you, son? No, mom, Liz and I are just dating...
- No, no barn dances yet...
- Yes, I know what goes on at those barn dances... Farm confidential. I hear you have a GIRRRRL-friend. As a matter of fact, I DO, Doc Boy.
- Have you KIIIISSSSED her yet? Yes, I have!
- Uh...what's that like? Garfield, all I think about is Liz...
- I can't think about anything else. I know what you mean...
- I can't get my mind off that ham in the fridge. Greetings.
- I am a new state-of-the-art multifunction diagnostic scale.
- I not only provide digital and voice weight measurement to the ten-thousandth of a pound...
- But also body fat percentage, a muscle mass index rating, pulse reading, body temperature...
- ... oxygen, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels, HDL and LDL counts, and EKG measurements.
- Please step on.
- GREAT googly moogly! I enjoy eating and sleeping
-
- Dit I mention eating? You lead a full life. Too much rice!
-
- That's one man's opinion. How am I to frost the cake now that you've eaten it?
- Simple!
- Frost this. Thanks again for dinner, Liz. Good night, Jon.
- Sigh. Sigh.
- Did you *see* the way she dialed out for pizza? Marry this woman. There is so much in the world I don't know about.
-
- But I *do* know where the food is, so...who cares? It's the first snowflake of winter!
- ...and the second! And the third!
- There!
- Well, the Lasagna's in the oven!

- I had no idea they were that organized. Oorah! I noticed you've been good all day.
- Why, thank you!

- lick lick lick
-
- thhhhhhhhhp!

-
- A GIFT CARD?
- I spend THREE WEEKS baking cookies, and all you get me is a lousy GIFT CARD?!!
- We will return to ""The Christmas Mommy Snapped"".
- Hide the rolling pin. This should be an easy two-footer...and...
- Oh, NO!
- HE FELL IN THE HOLE! Elf golf. Okay, I'm plugging in all the Christmas lights!
-
- Hey, we didn't blow a fuse! The laval lamp just erupted.
- BLINK
- Sant Claus is watching you.
-
- Watching me, you say? ...your cat named ""Alonzo,"" you say? Dear Santa, My cat, Garfield, has been very, very good all year long.
-
- I *will* get my pants back, right? *After* you finish the letter.
-
-
-
-
-
- Odie Need a hint? Ohhh, no! Not YOU again!
- Not THIS year...no WAY!!
- Visit Santa ""Jolly old elf,"" my foot. I HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER!!! Early Christmas present!
- HOLD ON!
- For me? I don't know, let's read the tag. What a wonderful season!
- What a beautiful tree!
- What a bountiful harvest! I've hidden your Christmas present where you'll *never* find it.
-
- Tickle me all you want. I'm not telling. He's tougher than I thought. Look what Liz got me, Garfield!

- Look! A Christmas card from Doc Boy!
- See! He even made it himself! Charming...
- It's not often you see a holiday sentiment scrawled on a scrap of gunny sack. Forget it, Garfield...
- There's no way you're going to guess your present this year.
- And the turban won't help. I see a carpeted cylinder...yes, it appears to be a scratching post... I need to dig deep within myself to think of a gift for Liz that truly expresses my feelings for her.
-
- A coconut monkey head? You're gonna need a backhoe. Here's something your girlfriend might like. What a pretty necklace!
- IT's on sale, too. MUWAH!
- Where'd you get the ice cream? They bought it for me while you were unconscious. Yes, Mom, Liz and I are still together.
- Mom! We're not *that* serious!
- She wants to give Liz her *corn bread* recipe! You might as well just buy the ring *now*. ""Happy holidays, Jon. All my love, Liz""
-
- See? ...right there... ""All my love"". I see it, I see it. Oh boy, oh boy, oh *boy*...
- Just five more days till Christmas! Only five!
- ...of course I don't need to count Christmas day, so that'd make it *four*...
- And *today's* almost half over, so if I don't count it, that's *three*...
- Then figure three days of sleep, at sixteen hours a day...
- Eighteen...carry the one...divided by 24...
- It's *Christmas eve!*
- You're wearing a groove in the table. Here comes Santa Claus!
- Boy, are you *fat*!
- Coming from him, that hurts.
- RIP TAER RIP RIP RIP
- Not all presents are for you I'm picking up on that. How cute. The pizza delivery guy was dressed as Santa.
- Hey! Someone ate our pizza!
- BURP
-
- Merry Christmas! So, Garfield, did you get everything you wanted for Christmas?
-
- That would be impossible, wouldn't it? Wow, two stupid questions in a row.
-
- This thank you note is gonna be a challenge. Words don't do it justice. Sigh
- I can't believe Christmas is over.
- I waited so long for it, and now it's gone...
- And I miss it.
- At least I still have you, old buddy. pat pat

- Which will require effort, determination...
- And being much sneakier. Your boyfriend called again.
- He sais he misses you madly, like a loon, and that dinner tonight cn't come too soon.
- He said that? Actually, he sang it, but it wasn't in my key. Liz, I love how well you and Garfield get along.
- It's almost like you and I are proud parents!
- Of a very fat, striped, orange child. Baby hungry.

- GAAAH! Hello.
- Goodbye.
- Avoiding the stuff in between is the key to a good relationship.

- I'm so cool my *shades* are wearing shades! Oh, please! Am I wasting my life?

-
- Hi, Arlene. Hi, Garfield.
- Thanks for eating Dave. His sister-in-law sent me flowers. Professor Odie will now explain wy dogs eat kids' homework.
-
- Where's your speech? Burp. I'm taking Odie for a walk. All right.
- tappy tappy tappy tappy tappy
- Then I'm bringing him back. Oh. Why is Odie holding this big rock?
- TONK
- That's why. All of my decisions are wrong.
- So I've decided to *stop* making decisions!
- Good decision. DING!
- Are the cookies done?! My underwear is dry!
- What a waste of a perfectly good ""ding"". ...and then I hacked up a hairball!

- Tell me, doctor, is there a cure for dogs? Is that a cat hair or a dog hair in my food?
- Dog hair, definitely.
- My hear wouldn't be caught dead in your cooking.
- I'm going to be late for an appointment!
-
- Really late!
-
-
- Really, really, *really* late!! Just go! Here.
- GARFIELD! I'm on it!
- Do your own laundry! And then it occured to me why I was limping all day...
- I was only wearing ONE SHOE!
- Why isn't he a tourist attraction?
- I stepped on gum.
- It says here, ""Hot Dog Hank"" was accosted and robbed in broad daylight today... What's this world coming to?
- The thief got away with everything in his cart. Tragic.
- Burp. Do you smell sauerkraut? What do you think of a collar with a little bell on it?
- Sure!

- Oh, great...

- They know me here. Right under a fire sprinkler. OH, NO! NOT AGAIN!!!
- WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS?!! Say...I recognize that voice...
- Armando! How are you? Welcome back, Senor Arbuckle. Every time we come here, we have you as a waiter, Armando. How is that?
-
- What a short straw. I am, as you say, cursed. Sir, before we begin, I have just one request.
- Shoot. Please don't order anything on fire.
- I *bought* you a new suit, didn't I?! Yes, but I still have the dreams. Oh, look! Popcorn shrimp! Armando, my fork is dirty. My apologies, Sir.
- I shall plunge it into my heart and get you a clean one.
- Boy, you've gotta admire that dedication. And that sarcasm. Did you leave Armando a nice tip? Of course.
- See? He's waving!
- With his fist? Right on, Armando! SLAM!
- I'm back from the gym!
- Yeah, there's nothing like pumpin' iron!
- You know, a dude like me can never be TOO ripped.
- Just check out these guns!

- Cats love to explore.
-
- Has the house always had a backyard? I wonder what Jon is doing.
- Is this lint or dust?
- WHY do I wonder?! This is a quasi-pleasant day.
- Almost not bad.
- Almost not bad at all... It's nice to see Jon get a handle on that rampant optimism of his. What are you so happy about?
- You've done something awful to me, haven't you?
- YAAAAAH! Just playing with your paranoia. I don't feel so good.
- How's your diet?
- Are you eating enough canaries? Quiet day.
- Garfield! Let me in! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
- Darn. It's back.

-
- Jon, here. He makes the coffee, too.
- I know, I know...
- Those bakery surveillance cameras add ten pounds. Oh, no!
- I washed my underwear with my new red sweater, and turned it all pink!
- What am I gonna do? I can't wear pink underwear!
- Waaait a minute...I know, I know, I'll buy a blue sweater...
- ...wash it with the underwear...
- And turn it all *purple*!
- And his dad thought that art degree was just a big waste of money. There was something I was planning to do today.
- Oh, yeah.
- This is it. Every day you seem to get a little lazier.
- You got that right.
- That's how I maintain my number one ranking, baby! Look for that tree! Slow down!
- I think I'm going to be sick!
- I haven't started the car yet. I'm warming up. You cannot put lasagna between two slices of pizza!
- Because it's...uh...
- Saaay... Welcome to my world. It isn't winter.
-
- It isn't summer, either. I need a bigger wardrobe. Garfield
- Garfield
- I have a feeling you're trying to tell me something. You are a genius.
- Jon, what are these? Just fridge magnets.
- Each one has the phone number of a different pizza delivery place.
- There must be at least 200 of them here. 232, actually.
- They're ranked top to bottom according to their black olive count, gooeyness of cheese, and chewiness of crust.
- ""Black olive count""? That's a BIG!
- *That* was a funny look. Girls are so weird. If I were the last mouse on earth, would you eat me?
- Not a chance...
- I'd force you to cook for me. The mice around here are getting pretty brazen. Nonsense.
- You're just imagining it.
- Are you hogging all the hot water again? GARFIELD! I thought chasing mice was what cats *did*...
- But I guess I was mistaken!
- And it takes a big man to admit he's wrong! pat pat Nooooot heeelping... I've switched to low-fat cheese.
-
- Just one more reason not to chase him. Hey! Quite down in there!
- Sorry.
- I knew this slumber party was a bad idea.
- Next Mouse
- Hold Please
- Sigh. bip bip beep boop
- You have *no* new messages.
- And I know I'm only a cell phone, but I get lonely TOO, y'now...
- So get some FRIENDS already why don't you, you sad excuse for a wireless customer...
- ...before I permanently switch your ringtone to the sound of a victorian funeral dirge!
-
- That actually might sound sort of cool. If it ever RANG! Nobody's perfect.
- Hey, Garfield.
- Ah! A visual aid! There's our homecoming king and queen.
- And that's me...
- I was voted homecoming court jester. Snazzy green tights. I'm cool.
- There's no such thing as a cool ball of yarn.
- How about now? I stand corrected. Time to get up! Z
- All right! That's good to know! Thanks for the heads up!
- I try to be informative. Z I sometimes make poor decisions.
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- Like thinking you might be sympathetic. Hey, I was laughing *with* you. Life has many mysteries.
- Mysteries that pique the intellect.
- And, when dismissed, free a lot of time for eating.
- Going to the fence to see your girlfriend? Ha-ha.
- Hi, Arlene. Hi, Garfield.
- Jon thinks you're my girlfriend. Am I?
- Be right back
-
- SMACK See what you started? I'm getting out of shape.
- Maybe you should take up swimming.
- MAYBE YOU SHOU'D SHUT UP! I'm good. Anyone home?
- No!
- No one ever said birds were smart. Stand back, cat. I'm a black belt! These legs are lethal weapons!
- Can you break a brick? Ha! Try me!
- Go. Where's Bob? Dunno. Phil? Dunno. Steve? Dunno.
- Hmm.
- Am I in a horror movie?
- Oh, Garfield.
- Yes? You're looking good, Fred. What's your secret?
- I've been working out and watching my diet.
- I'm eating healthier! RAAAAHR!!!
- Holy BONES, Corporal! There's a giant monster invading the city! That's not a monster, Sir.
- What are you talking about?! Call out the artillery!! It's just a bad actor in a rubber suit.
- OH, it's NOT! It's a monster! Come on...I can see the zipper!
- Egad! A ZIPPER Monster! That's the worst kind! And that's not a real city.
- INSOLENCE! I'll have you COURT-MARTIALED!! These are just tiny little model buildings...
- General Cordwood seems to have buried himself in the part. See? PUT MY HOUSE DOWN!! Z
- Hmmm, still dark.
- Z Garfield, you've slept your whole life away!
- That's not true.
- Although I don't seem to recall my teens. I'm not lazy...
- I'm ""sedentary"".
- Which is classy lazy. That's Wally Sneedhocker.
- He used to stuff me into my school locker every day.
- Now he's an undertaker. Go figure. This is GREAT, Garfield!
- With all the old t-shirts I found in this box...
- I may never have to do laundry again! DYNOMITE OR show your face in public. I made a short list for Jon's trip to the grocery store.

- We're SAVED!!
- I mean, oh, really! Liz will be here any time!
- Wait...my watch has stopped!
- Now she'll never get here! Let's hope his kind never multiplies. Jon, when was the last time you cleaned your OVEN?
- I didn't.
- -EVER?! The manual said it was SELF-cleaning. We're BACHELORS, baby. Sorry my kitchen was such a mess, Liz. Tht's all right, Jon.
- I promised I would fix you dinner, though, and I did.
- DING DONG There's the pizza now! Lady, I like the way you cook! Kiss me, Jon... Ow!
- Lip cramp!
- You haven't had a lot of practice kissing, have you? Don't tell his pillow that.
- Dear Jon, life here with you has become unbearable tic tic tic
- I can't stand it in this house another day, so I am running away the French Foreign Legion. tikka tikka tic tic tic
- Please don't try to find me. Just know that this is what I want, and that it's the best thing for both of us. Goodbye. tikkity tikkity tic tic tic

- Yep! That was life-transforming. YAAAAAAH!!
- What a horrible nightmare!
- It's good to be awake. Look. They've made donuts illegal. Don't try to challenge my authority, Garfield.
- No, sir, I won't.

- Y'know? Fishing's great, Garfield...the fresh air... I smell bait.
- The wildlife... Mosquitoes the size of canned hams. zzzzzzz

- One...two...three...four...
- You're counting cake slices, aren't you? Better take two. Happy birthday, Garfield! What's this?
- It's a lasagna-shaped cake! Liz made it.
- Come away with me. So, what's it like to be old and feeble?
- Better than being young and edible.
- But your wit is as keen as ever! Kiss-up.
- What a perfect night, Garfield. Uh-huh.
- A beautifull moon...a million stars...you and me together... Yup.
- Would you like to make it special? I sure would!
- But if I order another pizza with Jon's credit card, he'll kiss me.
- Arlene?
- What a perfect night... You look down, Garfield.
- Are you bored, upset or sleepy?
- I only get to choose one? Almost everything is your fault!
- That's not true.
- EVERYTHING is my fault!
- Here's a good spot to bury your bone, Odie!
- DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG I love my job. Wow!
- What a beautiful view!
- I can see a cat food factory from here! Jon! You shouldn't leave these things out!
- I might eat one!
- Fear not, my dear. I'LL protect you. ...and that's why I...hey!

- I think I'll go home and read the encyclopedias. And I'll mow the lawn with my teeth. The washing machine's broken...
- So I did my laundry in the dishwasher.
- Now my underwear smells lemony fresh. And the dishes? Well, that's another story. Well, the kitchen's floor's mopped!
-
- Did you know the linoleum had a pattern? And when was the last time you saw Paisley? rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
- Check out the carpet!
- Fresh vacuum cleaner tracks. I am the MAN!
- foof
- I think it's time to dust. Is it july again already? Dusting isn't so hard!

- THOOP
- The leaf blower *sucks*, too! Oh, for a world where pets could pick their owners. SLAM!
- I got my hair cut today!
- Haircuts are great. You get to sit in a comfy chair and put your feet up...
- The barber drapes a big cape over you...you hear the hum of the clippers...
- And then afterward he dusts your neck with that cool powder.
- Everything about it makes you feel special! Oh, come on, Jon, I don't see how...
- ...aaah! I love mondays!
- WHOOMP
- So much for reverse psychology. What time is it? How should I know? I'm not wearing a watch!
- HA! HA! HA!
- It was worth it. If wearing shades is cool...
- I figure wearing *three* pairs of shades must be *three* times as cool!
- About ten more pairs and you'll be in the neighborhood, pal! ...and that's how I spent my day.
- I'm surprised you sat and listened to me this long. What?!
- You mean this *isn't* a nightmare?! Odie seems to enjoy chasing his tail.
-
- Well? Not gonna happen. Don't claw me.
- Or bit me.
- Or anything else on the two-hundred-page list. I'm going to smack him with the list. Sigh.
- Liz is coming over again tonight, Odie.
- She comes over every weekend now.
- The two of them really seem to get along.
- I wonder how serious they really are...
- ...and I already ordered the pizza. No anchovies, just the way you like it!
- Life as we know it has just come to an abrupt and cruel end. When I was ten, Thought girls were weird.
- Bit now that I'm older...
- I KNOW they're weird. With maturity comes great wisdom, my son. Liz is coming over tonighjt.
-
- Guess I oughta power wash the living room.
- I love it when he gets domestic. Liz and I rented a movie. Want to watch it with us?
-
- There will be popcorn. I'll warm up the couch. Guess what? What?
- I have a surprise for Liz.
- And I've hidden it where you can never find it. In which case I have a surprise (burp) for *you*. Here, Liz.
- That's what's left of your flower after Garfield got through with it.

- I think we need more catsup. You think? The yard doesn't look so good.
- Now that you mention it...
- Out blade of grass could do with a trim. They say playing with your pet can be a real bonding experience.
- Funny, but I'm not feeling the love.
- Come a little closer. I'LL give you love. I have no clean clothes to wear.
- I gues I'll just have to break down and do the laundry.
- Although I could make a poncho out of the shower curtain. We're BACHELORS, baby. Giant man-eating shark off the port bow!! Where? I don't see anyth
-
- CHOMP
- Whoops...starboard. My bad. burrrrp I can never get those right either. This house isn't going to clean itself.

- That would be pretty cool, though. Let's wait a few more months, just in case. This tag clearly identifies you as my pet.
- Cool!
- I'm going to annoy big, mean guys!
-
-
-
-
- It's time for reading glasses. My birthday is coming up, you know.
- Please don't get me anything, though.
- Well, there you went and spoiled my surprise. Liz is taking me to dinner for my birthday!
-
- Me. Not us. ME. I hope your Arugula is rubbery. Longevity runs in my family, you know...
- My great-aunt Edna is 102, and is still sharp as a tack!
- The one who sews pants for her chickens? Still drives, too! My great-uncle Floyd is 98...
- And he STILL goes out into the fields every day.
- Most days they're able to find him. Whe he sings to the soybeans. That's my family and me at my college graduation.
- Mom...and dad...and Doc Boy... What's he holding?
- He took that chicken everywhere. The little cap and gown threw me off. There's Little Cletus Snitch...he lived up the road from us.
- He was a mean kid...always teasing the farm animals.
- Then one day a cow ate him. And the Snitch Burger was born.

- WHIP SLAP!

- Learned that from a Jersey cow.

- Oh, about your pitful existence?
- And how, with your limited mental assets, only hopelessness and despair await you for eternity?
- ...and there's nothing you can do about it?!

- She's hired a txidermist.
- That's his concept sketch. I look so lifelike. Who's that? Our neighbor, Mrs. Feeny.
- Interesting yard. She's quite the gardener.
- I meant the high-voltage fence Oh, that. You get used to the hum. I don't think Mrs. Feeny really hates Garfield at all.
- I just think she's a very unhappy person, who
-
- Uh-oh. Here she comes. I've been here all day. Don't you think you and Mrs. Feeny should make up and be friends?
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- Did your little talk do any good? It seemed to cheer him up. Have you been harassing Mrs. Feeny? Yes.
- I harassed her, and I'd gladly do it again! BWA-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!
- It's a good thing he can't hear me.
- Liz and I went shopping at the mall today.

- I'll look into it.
- Uh, Tommy, could I have a word with you? Garfield, we really need to talk about this mouse problem.
-
- Go ahead. Anything you say to him, you can say to us.
-
- Oh, the blight of urban sprawl. nibble nibble
- Whew! Stuffed!
- Sharing with mice is nice. Weird. The cheese drawer in the refrigerator...

- BURP? Happiness is contagious!
-
- I'm immune. Take a look at this, Jon!
- This is a pice of blank paper.
- Then may I assume you can also see that my dish is empty? I cut my finger on your cat food can today.
- I hope you appreciate what I go through for you.
- I hope you didn't bleed on my food.
- YAAAAAAH!

- I understand completely.
- I'd be embarrassed to be seen with him too, lady. You know, as a vet I can tell you that cats shouldn't really drink coffee.
-
- You're funny. I't nice to have a man around the house.
- There's a man around the house?
- I mean YOU, Jon. I knew that! This whole ""man"" thing is new to Jon. Liz always wants to do GIRL things.
- Today we went to a CRAFTS FAIR...
- And I... *sob!* ENJOYED it! There, there...let's go lie on the couch and scratch ourselves. I'm writing a love note to Liz.

- You don't splash me, and I won't splash xou.
- Agreed.

-
- Odie, would you please not stand so close to me?
- WHIRRRRRRRRRR

- Jon? Are you home?
- GIMME A ""C""!! Always phone first. Look, Liz forgot her purse.
-
- Touch it. Are you kidding? It might go off! I called Liz. She said she'd pick up her purse in the morning.
-
- Looks like it's spending the night here. Don't we have a lead-lined box or something? Liz's purse smells like her.
- I wonder what my wallet smells like.
- A sweaty black pocket. And scientific curiosity is sated once again, ladies and gentlemen! Having a purse in the house completely disrupts the swinging bachelor vibe around here.
-
- What? Say that again for my webcam, and I'll make you famous. DING DONG That'll be Liz to pick up her purse.
- Thanks, Jon...I've gotta run to work. kiss*
- FEEL FREE TO LEAVE IT MORE OFTEN! Close, the door, you're letting the mush in! I remember my aunt Orleen carried a REALLY big purse around all the time.
- Her right biceps was as big as her thigh.
- She was a sight in a strapless evening gown. And thank you in advance for my new nightmare.

-
- He makes me fell fun to be around. Nobody would dare to push you around, Garfield.
- You got that right, pal.
- They might pull a muscle. Hey! I can't go out tonight, Liz...I have a terrible cold.
- Don't worry, though. Garfield's taking good care of me...
- As in NOT! Can't you breathe in the other direction? Today I volunteered to help clean up the city park!
- It felt so good to be giving BACK to the community!
- And he got to swing on the swings. And I got to swing on the swings! I'm surprised you haven't caught my cold yet.
- Are you listening to me?
- Pardon? SLAMP!
- Want to hear about my date with Liz? Do I have a choice?
- We were in the car, staring into each other's eyes...
- I reached out to turn on the car radio, but pushed the lighter instead...
- Then it popped out into my lap, I screamed and jumped, my head went through the car roof, the airbags went off, and the horn stuck.
- sigh
- I've never been thrown out of a drive-in movie before. You have a rare and special gift, Jon Arbuckle. Now, nobody panic! We're all safe in here!

- DING-DONG I'll get it! I wonder who that could be? Men, I think the creature is hiding up in that ventilator shaft.
- Somebody's got to crawl up there and check it out...
- You! Private What's-Your-Name! Private Monster Chow. Did you bring me a brain, Igor? An *evil* brain? Yes, master...
- It's from an INSURANCE SALESMAN!
- Okay, Igor, now you're scaring ME. SOMEone's bucking for ""Employee Of The Month"". Dolores, in case that monster tries to eat us... Yes, Dirk?
- Well...I just wanted to say... Yes, my darling?...

- It looked like this.
- I love that face. You see it enough. Jon, thanks for serenading me at work with your banjo. You're welcome, Liz.
- Please don't do that again though, okay? Why not?
- The chihuahua I was examining went into shock. They always look that way. There are things I never realized about being a boyfriend.
- I have awesome responsibilities now...
- I hate to shave on WEEKENDS! No one ever said love was easy.
- Are you really going to EAT that?
- Do you know how many CALORIES are in that donut?

- You've really got the Christmas spirit, Garfield. You haven't been very good this year, you know.
- What are you asking Santa for?
- Leniency. Jon's right. I haven't been very good this year. Maybe I'd better start.
-
- Ow. I remember christmases back on the farm... Uh-oh.

- Isn't your Christmas list to Santa sent YET?! It's a big file. Hi, there!
- I'd like the cheapest tree you've got!
- This is an air freshener! Cash or charge, Diamond Jim?
-
- The tree's still crooked. Don't blow a fuse...don't blow a fuse...don't blow a fuse...
- plug
- HA! The toaster is riverdancing. Garfield, are you climbing the Christmas tree?
- Yes and no.
- You're hard to shop for, Liz. I STILL haven't bought your gift.
- Really? I got yours two months ago.
- nnnnnnngh! Oh, cheer up. Have somer loser nog. Liz, I'm stuck on your gift. I need a hint.
- Oh, Jon, you don't have to get me anything.
- She's REALLY not playing fair. Love is such a fun spectator sport. SLAM!
- I went to a girly boutique today to find Liz's gift.
- They had fancy soaps, skin creams, and perfumes.
- Then this batty old woman wearing ten pounds of makeup runs at me with an atomizer!
- I tried to run, but I tripped over a basket of luffas, crashed through a moisturizer display, and fell into a pile of potpourri sachets.
- Then she puts me in a half nelson, hoses me down with body wash, and force-feeds me bath oil beads.
- Now I smell like a coconut-cucumber-melon.vanilla-cherry-lemongrass-mango breeze. *sniff* With just a hint of plumeria, I believe. ""Merry Christmas, from your insurance company"".
- They always remember.
- ""P.S. and don't wear a necktie near the blender"". They remembered that, too. This online shopping is great! All you do is press akey, and...

- You'd think people would be interested in what I have to say!
- Well, they WOULD! Is it sunny in Jonland today? Today a lady at a Chinese restaurant sneezed on me.
- ...what was up with *that*?!
- My blog is getting edgier! There's a snow pea on your shirt. Nobody ever visits my blog...it's too dull.
- I guess no one wants to read about an ordinary guy and his cat.
- Time to make stuff up! Give me an eye patch and a goatee! My new call phone has a areally cool ringtone.
-
- Want me to play it? It's the only way we're ever going to hear it. SLAM!
- You wouldn't believe what happened to me!
- I went out to get the paper, and my robe got caught on a passing street sweeper.
- I swept five neighborhoods with my FACE before I could get the driver's attention.

- * Oh, the cat is fat, but we don't care! *
- * And the cat is lazy, but we don't care! *
- * And the cat is ugly, but we don't caaaaare... *
- * 'Cause he won't eat us! *
- He's gonna pay for those strings! Shut up, Herman. The tuna noodle casserole just burst into flames.

- You don't have tose toppings?
- Told ya! What if we supply the ingredients? These were taken when my mom and dad were dating.
- He took her out every saturday night.
- Here they are on their way to town. I've never seen airbags in a buckboard. Ah, the boring life...
- Quick! Garfield! I need a belt, a fishbowl, and a fire extinguisher!!
- I sure miss it. Oh, hi, Arlene.
- Do you ever think about me, Garfield? Whenever I'm not thinking about me.
- So that's a ""no"". Oh, hi, Arlene.
- Toothbrushes can't swim.
- I have a bad feeling. I forgive you for yelling at me, Jon.
- Which you'll be doing shortly.
- CLAW CLAW CLAW GARFIELD! I AM sick, you know!

- Let's see, what could it be?...
- How about ""Lord Of Lard""? I like it. An empty cat food bowl.
- The world's saddest sight.
- And in second place, ladies and gentlemen... What would it be like if cats ruled the world?
-
- ""If""?! Ol' Shecky was a fun fish. I'll sur emiss him.
- I guess it's true what they say...
- ""Never eat the entertainment"". Garfield...
- What kind of birthday cake would you like this year, Garfield?
- Glad you asked.
-
-
-
- I've never seen a blueprint for a cake before. And this is the electrical schematic. Birthdays are about more than just cake and ice cream, you know.
-
- Okay, so they're not. You crazy kidder, you. I may be getting older, but at least I have nine lives.
- Well, eight anyway.
- Stupid fuzzy bologna. I don't know why you're so upset about another birthday...
- Growing older is just a natural part of life!
- Just like ear hair and wheezing! You can go now. What would you like for your birthday this year?
- A cake?
- Oh, a BIG cake.
-
- Are you done licking the bowl? These things take time. Make a wish! Like THAT ever works.
- DING-DONG
- Happy birthday, Garfield! I stand corrected.
- This is going to be the best day ever!
- THUD!
- LEt's say second best.
- BZZZZT!
- Still top ten.
- BAP! I'm going back to bed. This is going to be the best day ever! Garfield, if you ever got out of bed...
- The world would probably end.
- No need for panic, world. zzzzzzz
- PLOP! zzzzzz

- Your subscription to ""Sloth Magazine"" has expired.
- That's just pitiful. Lick me a stamp. Garfield, you need to be more active.
- A fit cat is a happy cat.
- And a quiet vet is a likeable vet. And with today's thought, Odie!
- Yip!
- Concise, to the point, and stupid. Cats have strong instincts.
- I sense danger approaching!
- Diet soda? AAAGH!! Look what I got for you, Garfield...
- A little suit to match mine!
- It wasn't easy, but it did fit up his nose. NARFIELD! That's my prom picture.

- And this would be Mrs. Feeny's yard. Who put this hedge in the road?! I made you sugar-free cookies...
- With raisins!
- Have you always had this dark side? I'm convinced Garfield is plotting against me.
- Does that sound paranoid?
- Not really. Does so. Would you like to go out for dinner, Liz? Sure!
- And by ""out to dinner,"" you mean something other than...
- ...eating that bag of chips on the front porch, right? She must be psychic! Well, good night, Liz. Good night, Jon.
-
- I can't kiss her if you're watching, Garfield. I can stay as long as you like, Liz. Liz is everything I could ever want in a girl.
- I only hope with all my heart and soul that she feels the same way about me.
- You don't mind me confiding in you like this, do you? Say what?
- Jon, let's not go out tonight. Let's just talk.
- Talk? Sure! We talk on the phone all the time...sometimes for hours!
- Um...okay. Good. You start.

- I want just the right romantic mood.
- Better tune up my banjo. Whoa, Jonny...back the truck up... What you're doing is wrong!
- Wrong, I tell you!

- No...it's just a giant snowball.
- Wait...is that a catapult? I'll be in the bomb shelter. Sant knows when you've been bad.

- Maybe I could cop a plea bargain. Garfield, don't you think you're overdoing the ""good boy"" routine for Santa?
- ...Garfield?
- Your slippers, sir? You're freaking me out. I got a Christmas card, Garfield.
- I bet it's from my mother. How do you know that?
- It's addressed to ""Sissy Boy"". Maybe it's from your health club.
- Ow.
- Impressive. I think I strained my spinner. A little to the right...

- I think I'll consult with an expert...
- ...And she's about this tall. SECURITY! Liz, I'm really stuck on your Christmas present.
- You've got to give me a hint! I like pink.

- The day after Christmas is always so quiet and peaceful...
- And the excitement has died down...
- All the presents have been unwrapped...
- All the carols have been sung...
- All the cookies have been scarfed...
- WAAAAAAAHHHH So what does an elf like you do with the rest of your year?

- Hi! I'm Moo-Moo! And some of us watch ""Sock Puppet Friends"". I hate change.
- I didn't used to...
- But I've changed.

-
- For one thing, she LIKES me. Weird, isn't it? What can I do to impress Liz?
- Bake your cat a cake!
- You're no help. I know I'D be impressed. I'm composing a song for Liz.
- It's a tender love ballad.
- Sort of a polka-banjo thing. I'll be out back, burying your finger-picks. Hi, Jon, it's me. Hi, Liz!
- What are you doing? Oh, nothing much...
- It's laundry day here. Not a day for the fait of heart. What are you wearing to the restaurant tonight?
- You're going to wear thaaaat?...
- Well, then, I guess I'm not. The fashion police have a new sheriff. Urf

- You lose. Garfield wanted to come with us tonight. Are you sure he didn't?
- Huh? Isn't that him riding the dessert cart?
- Mine! All mine! Not if I don't turn and look. Boy, that Liz is a good kisser.
- Really good.
- Reeeeeally good... And the cat waltzes right out of his comfort zone. I love the old country songs, Garfield.
- They were so poignant.
- This one's called ""Times were hard, so we ate the cat"". So that's what poignant means. I'm wearing a new cologne.
- Eau de Bacon.
- You bit me! And I'm as disappointed as you are.
- CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG
- Subtlety is for weenies. Some day, huh?
- I slept through 90 percent of it...
- So I'll guess ""yes""?
- Ahem...
- That's MY chair. Que?
- GET UP RIGHT NOW! No hablo English, Senor Seatless.
- All right, if you won't let me have the chair...
- The LEAST you could do is SHARE it with me. Oh, very well...
- You're blocking the set. Beware, cat!
- My breed of fish is poisonous, and I can make you violently ill!
- My breed of stomach can eat 12 burritos bigger than my head. I'm toast. ...then I walked across the street. And then...
- You're boring me here, fatso. Get to the point!
- Can do.
-
- You ate my goldfish, didn't you? He went to my happy place.
-
- If it makes you feel any better, that goldfish didn't taste nearly as good as I thought it would. ""See the happy little goldfish"".

- There's me, stag, at the junior prom. Go figure. Garfield, Liz may be that special ""one"".
- Sure, she may tell lame jokes and her nostrils twitch when she's angry, but she may still be the ""one"".
- The ""one"" is right behind you, big mouth, and her nostrils are twitching. Huh.
- Liz says I don't share my feelings.
- She says that's important in a relationship.
- Perhaps I am being a callous pig.
- Maybe I should try harder at this.
-
- I love you, man. Bring back the pig,...man. Think we should order tonight?
-
- THAT was a stupid question. Ah-ah-ahhh... -there ARE no stupid questions! Is your pizza sauce thick?
- I mean REALLY thick?
- He says we could pave our driveway with it. CAN we?! ...do we want hot peppers on our pizza?
-
- Duh. Pepperoni, with extra onions...how many onions?
- WAAAHHHH

- I bet I've still got a masterpiece in me! I think we're out of black velvet. Should I paint a portrait...or a still life?
-
- Or both. Your muse is not amused. How about a real dynamic pose?
-
- I guess that IS pretty dynamic for you. Hurry up, I can't hold this forever. Give me a ""Mona Lisa"" smile.
-
- Mona Lisa din't smile like that! You never caught her at a Willie Nelson concert. What are you painting, Jon? Garfield.
- It needs more orange.
- There isn't enough orange in the WORLD.
- I've always thought so. ...there!
- I think I've captured your essence. Let's see.

- SMACK!
- GARFIELD! I love you, too. I have a picture of Liz in my wallet.
- You need a smaller picture.
- I need a larger wallet. Or that. I'm a very serious cat.
- I have little cowboys on my shirt!
- And it's not easy. I don't understand why you don't like me, Garfield.
- Is it because I'm cute? Or lovable? Or angelic? Or endearing? Or precious? Or young? Or personable? Or spunky? Or clever? ...
- Yes. Show me a cute, obnoxious kitten...
- And I'll show you a hole in the door. Where? There. Garfield! Did you throw Nermal through the door again?!
- That was mean! You should be ashamed of yourself!
- Yes, thank you. And funny but I'm not. Ah, the noble radish!
- Just what is it?
- Because I haven't the foggiest idea. Hmmm...
- I saw Jon hide a box of cat treats in this cabinet.
- What a pack rat! How much stuff is down here?
- He should know better thsn to hide anything from me.
- I'm a cat...supreme cunning and unparalleled resolve, and...
- Wait...
- What was I looking for again? Here comes Arlene. Better suck it in.
- SUUUUUCK THUD
- Wisdom comes with age.
- Wisdom? Woo hoo...

- But you're a present. What's scary about that? Open me up?
- A senior citizen's discount card. BWAH-ha-ha-HAAAAAH! I hope I don't have another age nightmare tonight.
-
- Are you the birthday boy? So much for hoping.
- What are you? I'm a comb-over.

- Jealous? What are you doing for dinner tonight, Jon?
- Oh, just opening a can of something.
- ""Something""? Did you read the label? Who has time for labels?! Dogs have an amazing ability to identify smells.
- Which comes as no surprise...
- Because they're responsible for most of them. ** Garfield...
- I'm going to order a pizza for dinner.
- And I can do without the confetti. Oh, how can you deny my unfettered euphoria? You've been on your back all day, Garfield!
- Ever thought of turning over?
- Ever thought of buying a giant spatula? Z
- The light bulb blew out again and I'm scared. Z
-
- Can I have a glass of water?
-
- Tell me a story.
- Didn't get much sleep last night? Clean out the stupid fridge!

- I need to simplify. This can't be good.
- I'm cutting back on personal hygiene. I could move somewhere warm. MOUSE!

- Do you suppose she's saving it up` Sure. For when she meets your folks. I'm saving this cookie for later.
-
- Late enough. Say...
- Jon, why don't we just stay in tonight and talk? Talk?
- Yeah...just sit on the couch and talk. Talk?
- You know...I say something, then you say something. Talk?
- It's good for couples to talk. Talk?
- C'mon...it'll be fun. Talk?
- You first, Jon. Uh...I have a cat... He's so cute when he's paralyzed with fear. Wow! Did you hear that thunder?
- It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up!
- Ditto that. I've heard thunder makes cats jumpy. Z
- BOOOM!

-
- BOOM
- Hey, I found a dime! My hero. That thunder can't get us now, Garfield. munch munch munch

- It's subtle, but it's there. The nose does not really make a good pencil holder.
- I'd write that down...
- But I seem to be out of pencils. I don't feel like barking today. Hey, pal. You have to. It's your JOB.
- Oh, very well... Bark

- I've never seen a cat do the cha cha. Thank you! Thank you! I'll be here all week! I'd like a large pepperoni.
- * DING DONG
- Now THAT'S service! It's cold. I wonder what we should have for dinner.
- INSERT PIZZA
- There's ONE subtle suggestion. We can't order pizza EVERY night of the week, can we?
-
- Then again, if we don't try, how will we ever find out? I'm loving this logic! C'mon, aren't we sick of ordering pizza every night?
- Uh-oh...
- I'm weakening. Looook into my eeeeyes... * RIIING *click* Jon here, I'm not home right now...
- I'm probably off on some exotic adventure...
- Hey, maybe I'll find a shrunken head! This is why we never get messages.
- What a nice day at the beach, Garfield.
- Even Jon is enjoying himself.
- Poor guy...he's usually a walking disaster area.
- Where is he with those hot dogs, anyway?
- SEAGULLS!
- I'm not gonna look. Good thinking. I just completed a home improvement project.
- Ever heard of bunk beds?
- Tah-dah! Garfield Garfield It's everybody's favorite quiz show, ""Ask Odie""!
- Ready for your first question, Odie?
- Hmmm... That wasn't it, dipwad! Hi! How's it going, Squeak? Never better!
-
- Another narrow escape! I am NOT the biggest loser in the world!
- See?!
- You're not even good at being a loser. Hi, Garfield!
- Surprised to see me? No.
- But HE is. Nothing will move me from this spot.

- CRASH!
- Was that the cookie jar?! Gravity is my friend. I don't know how to tell you, Garfield...
- But cats are supposed to be clean animals.
- Not during the tapioka festival! So, how's your teddy bear today?
-
- He's not speaking to us. You say your ordered too much chinese food tonight?
- ** DING-DONG There's the doorbell...hold on.
- He's already there, isn't he? Brought his own chopsticks. BARK!
- BARK! BARK! Oops!
- That was embarrassing.

- I decided to go with the SMALLER tie.
- Hey, you CHOOSE the be with him, lady. They put these little booties on me to keep my feet warm.
- I see.
- Is there any point in my barking at you? I'd only snicker. Z

- I'm bored.
- I know! Let's walk down the street and have a parade!
- I'll be the grand marshal, and you can be a float!
- People will line the street, cheering and throwing flowers!
- SMACK!
- I'm bored again. Welcome back. Remember when I was a loser with women?
-
- That was before I started going out with Liz. ...and she became a loser with men. Jon, why don't we stay in tonight?
- There's a figure skating competition on TV. Sure! I LOVE watching that!
- Wonderful! Okay, I'm guessing figure skating. Darn! My favorite T-shirt shrank in the wash!
- Thank goodness it still fits, though.
- This is a guy thing, right? Be thankful it wasn't his pants. How are you today, Garfield? Great!
- Couldn't be better! Swell!
- You have to be careful what you tell a veterinarian. Jon? Yes, Liz?
- Are your feet painted black? Yes.
- I couldn't find my shoes this morning. And we had plenty of foot paint. Jon, this may come as a shock to you, but...
- scratch scratch.
- Now, where was I?
- I'm glad we went out for breakfast. It's nice to have some time alone.
- Oops...spoke too soon!
- I can't eat with them staring at us like that!
- Just ignore them.
- Try lowering the blinds.
-
- I'm up to wednesday!
- No more eating ahead! Yee-hah!
- Now what? A man with a rake will turn you into mulch.
- I withdraw my ""Yee-hah"". Garfield, can you come here?
- Yes.
- When Liz gets here, be on your best behavior.
- I'm cool with that.
- On second thought, be on somebody ELSE'S bes behavior. Oh, come on! Yes, mom, Liz and I are still together.
- Yes, I know we make a lovely couple.
- Yes, I know you'd like to see grandchildren before you die. Moms are not masters of subtlety. Beware Of Dog Is this your sign?
- No.

- I've got news for you, mister!
- That's just one of its faults! Hold on!
- Whoa! I thought I was going to sneeze, but then I didn't!
- Life is like a mad, crazy coaster ride! General, the zombies have breached our perimeter!

- Is this my life?!
- There must be something more! My litter box is about to be declared a hazardous waste dump. So, how'd you get so FAT?
- Eating chubby mice.
- Let me rephrase that. Shall we go out to dinner tonight?
- Okay!
- She was talking to me! Very well, you may drive. I'll be howling at the moon tonight! Why do you do that?

- How about Italian?
- No? Chinese, then?
- How does pizza sound?
- Or we could just do big greasy burgers.
- Oh, and we may have to bring the cat. ""May""? There is no ""may"". Do you think there could be creatures from outer space watching us?
- Could be...
- How desparate are they for entertainment? We're here to enjoy the great outdoors, Garfield.
- To commune with nature.
- You're not communing! I can fit seventeen noths in my mouth. Nice to see you, Garfield.
- MY cookie!
- It's the friendly ones you have to watch out for. Love is what I'm all about.
- Did I say ""love""? SMACK!
- I meant to say ""pastry"".

- The stomach museum called, inviting you to a one-man show.
- Fat Watchers called...they want to come over and stare. All this talk is making me hungry. Here is a box.
- Fill it with something and give it to me.
- Ah, the spirit of Christmas. Do you know what you want for Christmas, Garfield?
-
- This is a picture of a pizzeria. We could put it right over there. Your Christmas list needs to be a little more practical.
- Fine.
- This is an ice cream truck. Transportation AND nourishment! Garfield, this isn't a Christmas catalog...
- It's a restaurant supply catalog!
- Ooo, a hot dog cart! And it matches our sofa perfectly! Have you finished it? Done and done.
- I just e-mailed it.
- Why did the lights just go dim? We're downloading Garfield's chhristmas list.

- Dear Santa, I have been a very good cat all year long.
- You can't fool Santa, you know.
- He knows if you've been good OR bad.
- And he's watching you all the time.

-
- No fat guy would ever do that. STOMP!
- STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- We will return to ""Santa's Elves versus Godzilla"". The battle is just a bit lopsided. Dog drool...
- And mistletoe!

-
- I MEAN... Toooo late. Jon, stop worrying about what to get me...
- I'm sure whatEVER you pick will be PERFECT, and JUST what I want!
- No pressure there. In theater, this is referred to as ""flop sweat"". I don't know what to get my girlfriend for Christmas, dad.

- The ones with the lace bib. May I talk to mom?

- Run while you still can!
- New sweater. Run, Odie! Garfield, I've made a resolution!
- No more thumb-sucking!
- Except during scary movies. That goes without saying. Any new year's resolutions, Garfield?
- To stop eating junk food, and to exercise every day.
- And to curb my incessant lying. Any new year's resolutions, spider? To think befor eI speak.
- ...FATSO!
- Blew it already, didn't you, Bob? Go bite a black widow, Larry. Making any new year's resolutions, Garfield? Yep.
- The same one I make every year.
- Not to mess with perfection.
- HAPPY NEW YEAR!
- Woo hoo! So that explains the hats.
-
- Hey there, guy!
- Hi, boy!
- Howdy-doo! *
- Sigh...
- It's lonely being a scale on new year's day. I seek truth!

- But a cookie will do.
- Don't ever change, Jon!
- Want to look like a winner? Hang around a loser.
- It's nice to be stared at by you, Garfield.
- FINALLY somebody gets it! Odie, I would like to speak seriously to you.
-
- But that would be impossible. Sometimes I wonder...
- I wonder what life would be like without you.
- Would I be happier? You'll never know. Remember the time I stepped on your tail?
- The important thing is that YOU remember it.
- When the weather is damp, I still walk with a limp.
- Yip!
- Don't do that!
- Yip? Yeah, that.

- BARK! I'm a happy cat! I'm a happy cat!
- Uh...
- Boy, that donut wore off fast. I'm not going to bite you.
- But I AM going to disrespect you in my blog.

- And not to present the other side, here's Odie.
- Hey! No puppy-dog eyes! BURP! BURP! BURP! BURP!
- BURP! BURP! BURP! BURP!
- Are you quite through?! The good times can't last forever, pal. Is that a gag tie?
- Uh...
- Try saying ""yes"" and see what happens. Hey, Jon.
- Check out my happy expression.
- Getting nervous yet?
- BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Hey, how about I take you for a walk?
- A CAT walking a dog? Are you trying to humiliate me?! No, I was just...
- Well, you're doing a good job, mister!
- My self-esteem is ruined! Sorry, I was joking.
- So...no walk? Dogs. You're not perfect, you know.
- I must agree.
- It is my one fault. I think I look good in a hat.
- Odie, not so much.
- That's not a mouse hole. It's just drawn on the wall.
- What is? MEOOOOOWWRRRR
- ROOWWRR
- Can't you rehearse someplace else?! Opera hater. I think you'll like the restaurant I've chosen.
- Will they have a place to plug in ma jacket?
- Changing? Mx jacket clashed with the expression on Liz's face. Woo-hoo!
- I finally got the knot out of my shoelace!
- That was a day well spent. Sigh...
- I gave up donuts for my new year's resolution, Garfield.
- I haven't eaten a donut for three weeks now.
- I didn't think it would be so hard.
- Boy, I sur emiss them . HI, Liz!
- Okay, did you see that? He usually has sprinkles. Um...'sup?
- Uh...nice shoes!
- I'm practicing some things to say to Liz. Leave nothing to chance. What's the name of that perfume you're wearing?
- You probably smell the chocolate chip cookie in my purse.
- That's a long name. Where have you been all my life? Jon...
- Isn't one of you pant legs a little short? Huh?
- GARFIELD! Needed a headband. Do you mind if I gaze into your eyes, Liz? Not at all.
-
- I wasn't trying to hypnotize him. It just happened. Make him cluck like a chicken! * KISS

- They gave it back. Surprise, surprise.
-
- We cats have to get into this eating-kids'-homework racket. Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, that's okay. But I have a really good explanation.
- I put on my pants backwards. And he walked three blocks in the wrong direction before he realized it. I'm not wearing my slip-ons today...
- I'm going to wear shoes with laces!
- Don't be a hero, Jon!

- But first we should alert the fire departmen.
- 'cause my lips are on fire. Maybe it'll spread to the jacket. Liz, have I told you how beautiful I think you are?
- About thirty seconds ago.
- Oh, that's right! Have you tried dating without notes? I think I embarrassed Liz in the restaurant.
- Why can't I remember?
- Use the silverware!
- Or don't order spaghetti and banana cream pudding. Liz wants me to share my feelings.
-
- What the heck does that mean? Maybe it's in the dictionary.
-
- Only six more hours until my date with Liz! Looking forward to it, are we? I bought you some chocolates, Liz.
- Wh, thank you, Jon.
- Would you like to smell them on Garfield's breath? No, thank you, Jon. Come on, take whiff. They were great!
- Garfield, get up. It's almost noon.
-
- I know it's cold, but you can't stay in bed FOREVER!
- Are you going to hibernate all winter?! POKE POKE POKE

- I knew this bear mask would come in handy. People are more important to me than things.

- BURP!

- They were just the right size for sparrows.
- I am so glad that I can't understand you. Next, I'm thinking of experimenting with squirrels. Good riddance, winter!
- At last! No more snow! No more ice!
- No more windchill factors!
- No more cold floors in the morning!

- YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL! Ready for our group gag? Hello? ...no, I just woke up.
- Okay, I'll look for it.
- Liz can't find her makeup case. Haven't seen it!!! It's amazing what you can learn online.
- BRAIN-EATING MARTIANS ARE GOING TO GET US!
- Like how gullible some people are. *
- What a beautiful spring day, Garfield.
- Blue sky...warm sun...
- Perfect for working in the garden.
- People should really celebrate days like this.
- HELLO, MISTER SPRINGTIME!!!
- Should I look? How's your heart? I've seen it all.
- Nothing impresses me.
- I just felt the best breeze! Jon, on the other hand... Woo-hoo! It's butterfly time!
- Whoa, I'm a little dizzy.
- I'm going to lie here awhile and then call a cab. Nature isn't what it used to be. It's everybody's favorite quiz show, ""Ask Odie""!
- Ready for your first question Odie?
- Hmmmm... That wasn't it, dipwad!
- Still breathing, I seel.
- I like to keep busy. Well...uh...I...uh...um...you know...gee...um...
- Bye.
- I was trying to leave Liz a voice mail. You really should work with notes. Jon! I've been kidnapped!
- And I could use a little help with my ransom note.
- How do you spell ""sardines""? When you miss naps you scare me. Garfield

- Not loving the liver? Not loving the liver. There's cat hair on everything. That is an exaggeration.
- Look at the ceil...
- Never mind. The computer has a virus!
- Now it crashed!
- Jon doesn't do well with technology. Now it's packing to leave! How are you today, Garfield?
- YOU tell ME.
- And she calls herself a veterinarian. Prepare to be swatted, bug!
- Go ahead. Just don't sit on me.
- See, I said that 'cause you're fat. There isn't a newspaper big enough... eek! The cat!
- Fear not! There is safety in numbers!
- Funny...I don't FEEL safe. Shut up. I love field trips. I sometimes regret doing this.
- SMACK!
- It's not good for the magazine. MY SYMPATHIES!
-
- POUNCE!
-
- THUD!
- Now where's my laser pointer? Revenge is mine!! What a beautiful day!
- KABOOM!
- Nature can be cruel. And funny! Here's your dinner, Garfield.
- The label came off the can, so I'm not sure what this is.
- Sometimes that's a blessing. BOOT
- BLORP!
- The mashed potatoes might taste kind of funny tonight.
- BEWARE of Nothing
- There's gotta be a catch... You know, Jon, people with pets live longer.
- Yeah, if we LET you.
- He's doing it again! What?! Meow. SLAM!

- I don't think I'll show it to her. Smart move, Pablo. I'm all about my beauty.
- STOMP STOMP
- Should have made a backup plan. Sigh
- Aren't the stars beautiful tonight, Garfield?
- They're all sparkling like little diamonds!
- You know, I'm really glad you're here to share this evening with me. It makes it even more special.
- Are you glad I'm here with you, too?

- And the day is already ruined. **

- Where have you been? Heaven! Every day is just like every other day.
- My life has been one LONG day.
- You waste a lot of money on calendars. This cereal is a good source of fiber.
- Fiber?
- So THIS is where missing socks go. Somebody should write a poem about you, Liz.
- How about YOU, Jon? Me?
- Uh...I'm not very good... What rhymes with ""meow""? Dogs love to swim.
-
- And I know lots of OTHER embarrassing things, too. Z

- It has?
- Man, I should have been paying attention. Love...

- Is felleting. I've told you before, guys...
- No pillaging at the dinner table.
- But we're vikings. Who wants to ride in the car?!
- You never show any entusiasm, Garfield. I don't like to ride in the car.
- And I have hidden his keys. What's that, Liz? You're asking me if I can dance?
-
- Wait, do you smell something burning?
- OH, yeah, my shoes are on FIRE! In your dreams.
- Because I say so, that's why!
- Thirty-two minutes. That's a new record for a comeback. YES! rrrrrrrr
- Finally! All done!
- BOOOOM

- SPOING
- That's just not fair. Suck it up, mow boy.
- Annoyed yet?
- Yes, Jon. For over thirty-three years now, Jon. They say the older you get, the wiser you get. I've heard that.
- Boy, you must be a stinking GENIUS!
- And his reflexes aren't too shabby either. So, how old are you going to be this year?
- You know, that's kind of an impolite question to ask.
- Wow, that old, huh? Cheer up, Garfield. It's only a birthday. Not helping.
- There'll be cake. Helping.
- With lots and lots of candles! Not helping again. What are you worried about your birthday for, Garfield? Cats have NINE lives!
- Aww...feel better now? I love you, Liz.
- You're a good liar. It's tonight's age night mare, Garfield, and I'm a HEARING AID! You don't look so scary.
-
- AAAAY?
- We're here for the party this week. Where's the cake? The kithcen is that way.
- OKAY, FELLAS! fOLLOW ME!
-
-
- Definitely one of my more depressing birthday nightmares. Hi! I'm your age nightmare!
- What are YOU doing here?
- Uh...
- Funny...I knew before I walked into the room. Whoa, if I eat another bite, I'm going to explode.
-
- Better stand back...
- I have being cute covered for today.
- That's one less thing for me to worry about. ""Dear Ask A Dog""...
- ""who wants to go for a walk?""
- We'll have to get back to you with that answer. Liz isn't coming over tonight.
- Hey, it's just us guys! Uh-oh...
- We can can run around the backyard in our underwear! LIZ!!!
- Why not turn the computer on?
- And ruin a perfectly good day?! pffffft

- Dogs are lousy bluffers. The world is filled with many wonders.
-
- And Jon.
-
- Looking forward for dinner? How can you tell? You can't have everything!
- Good!
- Because a lot of stuff stinks.
-
- Have you checked out the gift shop? Stay out of my closet! Oops, I dropped a contact lens.
- I didn't know you wore contact lenses, Jon.
- I don't. I just like to carry them around. And I know WAY weirder stuff about him, lady!
- AIIIEEEEEE
- I didn't know your voice could go that high. You clawed me! Don't change the subject, choirboy. 97, 98, 99,199!
- I just did 100 pushups!
- All right, I admit they were video game pushups.
- But I think I strained a tendon...
- And tore a cutile.
- I think I'll go put ice on it and lie down.
- Is he always this. You don't know the half of it. lady. GAH! THAT'S COLD!
- Why so grumpy?
- I'll think of something.
- BURP!
- I've been saving that up. There are certain drawbacks to summer.
-
- There were five of them.
-
- I have to admit...dogs know how to relax. No, Liz, and that's final! Oh, okay.
- I'm going shopping.
- BECAUSE I WANT TO! Hand over your man card. I just texted Jon.
- I would prefer that you meow at me in person.
- Quaint is so cute.
- ""Directions for easy preparation"".
- ""Preheat oven to 425 degrees"".
- ""Place on center rack for 17 to 19 minutes, or until crust is golden brown"".
- It also says we can microwave it in six minutes.
- What do you think?
- 'bout what? Cats know how to have fun.
-
- It's a carefully guarded secret. Invader from outer space!
-
- Okay, tourist from outer space.
-
- Somebody had their teeth cleaned today. Another one?!
- The ice cream man is giving free samples again?!
- I'm getting one! You'll need this brick. Liz, have I shown you my tie that's so wide I don't need to wear a shirt?
-
- She still hasn't said anything. Not even blinked. Yay, team!
- Oh, wait...I don't have a team.

- You wrote this one, didn't you? Yip! Garfield, I'm getting old!
- I found a grey hair! Don't panic.
- It was in my ear! Okay, panic. Aging is no fun, Garfield. And what's even worse...

- What does ""meow"" mean?
- MEOW
- What?
- MEOW! MEOW! MEOW!
- I just don't understand you.
- Sometimes ""meow"" just means ""meow"". The world exists for my amusement.

- This must be an intermission. There's a lot to learn about the world, Garfield.
-
- Not that we plan to learn it. Whew.

- Here's your ticket.
- All scheduled departures are on time.
- BOOT! And do have a good trip! We should form a book club.
- And then we should sit around talking about books...

- Hello?
- Odie swallowed your phone again. ECHO POINT ECHO POINT
- Oh, ha-ha.
- I told you it wasn't funny. He laughed, didn't he? I'm learning a lot from Liz.
- For instance...

- Smelled cookies.
- Yikes.
- Look at all those cobwebs.
- That's just nasty.
- We should do something about that.
- Yeah.
- Let's never look up again. We're BACHELORS, baby. People always ask me, ""Garfield, how do you do it?""
- And I always replay..
- ""Do what?"" You know what's good? Spinach.
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, Jon!
- I believe the correct pronounciation of thet word is ""dooooonut"". Odie, why are you always so content?
-
- Liz says I can be sarcastic.
- I don't think so.
- What do you think, ""Flash""? Flash agrees with Liz. Liz says I need to be more of a thinker.

- I couldn't remember what I was on vacation from. I've done that. Someday mice will rule the world.
- Then what? We'll get to live in people's houses and eat cheese. You don't say. rrrrrrrrrrrr
- VRRRRRRMMMMMM
- Tell me I didn't see that. You didn't see that.

- That was the best cookie I've eaten today!
- And the competition was fierce. I'm too tired to climb this tree...
- Let's just say I did.
- What are you doing? Pretending to sweat. Life has different seasons.
- A time to laugh, a time to reflect...
- I'm going through my ""Sunny Period""! A time to seek therapy... Allow me to get the door for you, Liz.
- I'm always the gentleman.
- That's the closet. He said he was polite, lady, not smart.

- I'll get presents and cards! Jon, how shall I say this?...
- And cake! Happy birthday, buddy! Hi, Liz! Today is my birthday!
- Well, not really, but I need cheering up.
- Can you just play along?! Aaaand, she's off the guest list. No one came to my birthday party. It's not your birthday.
- Maybe this was a dumb idea. Really?!
- But we'll always have the hats! Time for your birthday noogie. That's the cafeteria staff.
- School lunches were fun.
- We had ""Mystery Meat Mondays"". I LOVE guessing games!
- My shoelace broke today.
- So I replaced it.
- And then the other one broke!
- So I replaced that one, too.
- Oh, well, you know what I always say...
- ""Tomorrow is another day"". Does it have to be? The good times can't last forever.
- I'll keep that in mind...
- In case they ever START! My coffee is stronger than Jon's.
- My coffe is whimpering!
- Mine slapped it around a little. Dogs have no business drinking coffee.
- LAP LAP LAP LAP SLURP SLURP LAP LAP LAP LAP
- I rest my case. Poor Jon hasn't been able to sleep.
- The stress and responsibility of modern life.
- There's a monster under my bed. And his night-light broke. SIGH

- They must be thinking about cupcakes, too. There is a wise man on top of this mountain.
- AAAAAAAAAHHHH THUD
- Okay, maybe not so wise after all.
- Feel that nip in the air, Garfield?
- That's fall.
- And do you know what that means?
- That means I have mowed my LAST lawn for the year!
- WOOOSH
- I could just scream. Suck it up, rake boy. From now on, I'm in charge around here.
- Sure thing, let me write that down.
- We'll just call it ""Plan B"". I've got a thousand legs, pal!
- What do you think of that? I don't care.
- You'll care when I start KICKING you!!! WOO-HOO!
- WOO-HOO!
- New sneakers! It's the small things in life that irritate me the most. Odie is climbing a tree. THUD
- THUD
- And, needless to say, digs aren't real good at that. THUD WHUMP!
- Fear not!
- HA! HA! HA! So far, so good. My new movie is a twist on the old werewolf story.

- It opens with a blood-curdling moo! I smell an Oscar.

- That must've been a good monster movie. Want to go to dinner and a movie?
- Sure, we could do that, or...
- I could transplant your brain into the body of a gorilla!! Eeeek! Never date a mad scientist. I can't sleep, Garfield.
- I think there's a monster in my closet.
- I heard him scream. He no doubt saw your wardrobe. And just what are you? I'm a ghost.
- I'm cold, so I'm wearing a quilt instead of a sheet.
- Lost the passion, huh? Two more months until retirement, and it's the Bahamas, baby! * DING-DONG
-
- Most pets don't ring doorbells and run! But, duh! If you walk, you get caught! I was gazing into Liz's eyes...
- And she dozed off.
- She must not have been gazing back. Wanna bet? Even with truth on your side...
- It can still be hard to make others believe you.

- Then one day a milking machine ripped his lips off. Interesting smile. I crave action!
- Wait, that's not right.
- I crave pudding! What can I do to impress Liz at dinner tonight?
- Take me with you!
- You're not helping. And lavish me with a big, thick steak! * RING
- No, that's okay...I understand, we'll do it next week.
- That was Liz. She had to cancel our date.
- An emergency came uo at the animal hospital. Shot down because of a gerbil with a chest cold.
- Sigh.
- I hate gerbils. So do I, They're all gristle. Garfield, can you come here?
-
- No. I used to practice my dance moves in a mirror.
- Then one day dad caught me.
- He burned my tutu. I may not sleep for days. Here's an interesting stamp.
- Fascinating! And thank you for sharing!
- I'm not through. Oh, look! The escape hatch is closing! I wonder if life is still out there?
-
- Yes! And it has chocolate chips! Did you know that Liz is a veterinarian? Seriously?
-
- My knee hurts. Jon? Usually dogs look ridiculous in sweaters.
-
- But ""ridiculous"" wouldn't do that dog justice.
-
- Where do you keep your baster? Bottom kitchen drawer.
- Thanks. No problem.
- Just a turkey hallucination. I get them this time every year.
- Nothing to worry about.
- Hey, we can't find the casserole dish. They keep moving it. Some people. Hey, Garfield, I'll throw a pea, and you catch it in your mouth!
- donk
- Never mind. What's next on the agenda, you mad, crazy, fun person, you?
- It's not healthy to feed pets people's food.
- Or to talk crazy talk to a carnivore. Cheeseburger! Is that all you got?
- Lasagna! I lught!
- A cheeseburger, lasagna, donut sundae! -HA! You drooled! He's good. So you and Garfield are pigging out today.
- By any chance, are you wearing togas?
- What? More grapes. Let's see what's for supper.
- Looks like leftovers.
- Is meat loaf supposed to be this color? I'll get our meat loaf color chart. tick tick tick tick CHUKUNK!

- When you run in them...
- They play ""Flight of the Bumblebee"". I need a really huge fly swatter.
-
- Odd...my self-esteem just dipped. Let's take a look at the weather.
- A cold front is heading this way.
- Who left the window open? The sports guy. That's creepy.
- I got a strange voice mail.
- It sounded like a screaming donut. One made it to a phone.
-
- Hoe's oh-so subtle. I thought this would be fun.
- Outdoors...cutting down our Christmas tree...
- That was a telephone pole. We should leave now.
- I decided to get a small Christmas tree this year!
-
-
-
- SQUINCH
- Changed my mind. So I have to be good for a whole month. Not a problem.
-
- This is gonna kill me! Decorating a Christmas tree.
- Rule number one...
- Never let the cat help. I feel festive!
- I made eggnog!
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?!! Needs more nutmeg. Gee, I sure wanted the last donut.
- But someone has taken it.

- I SAID I was sorry!
- Starched his Santa hat.
-
- Christmas bone catalog. Santa, bring lots of presents to my house. I will have cookies.
- HA! You can't bribe Santa!
- Ooooooooo, cookies. Banned from the mall! ...AGAIN!
- I hope you're proud of yourself!
-
-
- I've got the Christmas spirit! How about you?!
- Fah la la la la! Woo hoo! Woo hoo! 'tis the season to...
- MAY ALL YOUR BATTERIES NOT BE INCLUDED!!! Look, Garfield!
- It's one of those recordable cards from everyone on the farm!
- MOOO! The cow.
- OINK-OINK! The pig.
- CLUCK-CLUCK! The chicken.
- BAAAA! The sheep.
- HEY, NEENER HEAD! The brother. ""I can wrap the present,"" said the kitten. ""I can sing the carols,"" said the puppy.
- ""And I can trim the tree,"" said the mouse.
- They love that part. Only one more week of being good till Christmas!
- CHRISTMAS CAROL POLKA!
- * ROLLLLLL OUT THE EGGNOG... * I'm not gonna make it, am I? Garfield, why don't you take a nice, looong nap?
-
- Jon's wrapping presents! Odie, want to know what I got Garfield for Christmas?
- whisper whisper whisper
- You'll NEVER find where I hid your present this year, Garfield. Oh, yeah?!
- We'll SEE about that!
- I hope he does find it. I forgot where I put it. This came for you, Santa. A GPS! How nice!
- And it's already programmed...
-
- I'm baking Christmas cookies for Liz!
- OW! OW! OW!
- HOT! HOT! YAAH! FIRE!
-
- I accidentally set the oven to ""broil"".
- We lost 12 gingerbread men, 6 elves, 3 Santas, and a sugarplum fair. Oh, the humanity.
- Welcome
- Welcome Merry Christmas, Jon.
- Merry Christmas, Liz.
- X Merry Christmas, everyone. ...and Liz made me a GREAT Christmas dinner, mom!
- Go ahead and warm up the TV, Liz! I'll be right there!
- No, your potatoes are better. I HEARd THAT! So much for peace on earth. Let's see the sweater mom made you for this year.
- Wow! It fits perfectly! And it's tasteful.
- I think I'll call to check on her. I'm worried too. Who knows what the future holds?
- Me!
- DONK! I do! I got Greta the bodybuilder to pet-sit you guys again on new year's eve!
- YAAAAAAHHH!
- ...you remember Greta, don't you? Let's see what I have...
- How about the purple... No.
- Or the plaid... No.
- Or the puce... No. Or the striped... No. Or the vrushed velvet... NO.
- Geez, Liz, all that leaves are my lederhosen and a gunnysack!
- ...what is WHAT like?
- It's brown and itchy. I'll go cut some holes in it. Tonight we will all ring in new year with vigorous cardio workout! thump thump
- bip bip beep boop boop boop boop bip
- I'll get you for this. Hello? ...hello? Garfield, I'm taking the personal-hygiene pledge.
- I promise to brush my teeth every day.
- Even if I'm not going anywhere. This is a cult, right? We should simplify our lives.
- Z
- Z I should simplify my life.
- I wonder, Garfield...
- Will anyone remember me when I'm gone? You're still here? Jon, I have made a big decision.
- I've decided to retire.
- Go away. I need a villa. Hi, Garfield!
- Hey, as long as I'm here...
- Let's check for parasites! Who let the vet in?
- sip
- Hmmmmm
- slurk
- This hot chocolate needs something.
- snap!
- Much better. We should travel and see the world. Okay...
- How about this?...
- We walk to the window and look out. Okay, Odie, when I give the signal, you distract Jon. I'll grab his food, and we'll meet back here to split the booty. Got it?
-
- Okay, you stand here and slobber. I'll order a pizza. May I borrow the steak sauce?
- I thought you weren't a fan of steak sauce.
- I'm not. Odie's chewing up your slippers. Hey, nice suit! See, Garfield?
- I really like it. I DO have good taste.
- C'mon, make it light up! We should go shopping now. Liz, could you be getting more beautiful every day?
- How sweet of you to say that! But I don't think so.
- Yeah, you're probably right. Run, Jon! Run! I'm not really sleepy.
- Z
- But I AM a professional cat.
-
- pat pat pat pat pat pat
- DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG
-
- Today I'm going to go with the flow.
- Come on, world! Whatever happens, happens!
- That is, if you can find me. What a glorious day!
- Fabulous? Nice?
- At any rate, nothing's on fire. You got that right.
- SIGN
- That seemed unnecessary. Milk...
- Some people read expiration dates.
- And some don't. Tell me about your feelings, Jon. My what?
- Feelings. Um...
- So I pretended to faint. That's a conversation stopper. How do I smell, Garfield?
- I put on a whole bottle of pine-scented cologne!
- sniff sniff sniff sniff This won't end well. ZIP
- Garfield, they say as you age, life speeds up.
- Whoa, look! I'm over here already!
- Now I'm in the kitchen!
- Now I'm BAK!
- NOW I'M IN THE BACKYARD!!!
- click I bought new curtains, Garfield.
- They're for people with pets.
- Pre-shredded. Well, that just saps all the joy out of life. Garfield, I lost my phone!
- I feel so isolated...
- And I like it! This must have been how cavemen felt. Nothing to eat around here except dog biscuits.
- Oh, well, things could be worse, I guess...
- LIKE NO MILK! Isn't this better than watching TV in a stuffy room?
- This is reality!
- Ummm...so it's like a documentary? It's called ""outside""! When I was in school, I once annoyed an old gypsy woman.
- She put a curse on me.
- She said I would never get a date to the prom. What a waste of a perfectly good curse. Garfield, you would look adorable with some ribbon in your hair. Excuse mse. . OW!
- What was that? I clawed Jon.
- Garfield! Odie! Liz and I would like to be ALONE.
- Outside! Shoo!
- SLAM!
-
- I can't make up my mind.
- Should I do nothing?
- Or start to do something and then quit? How can I go on like this?
- We're having pizza for dinner.
- THAT'S how! ZIP
- I'm a turtle.
- ZIP But not a very good one.
- Meow
- I'm taking the day off. Liz canceled our date.
- And I'd already made dinner reservations.
- Forget it! I'll pretty up. I have built a perfect scale model replica of the parthenon.
- It took days...
- ...probably shouldn't have made it out of chocolate. And now back to our game.
- Okay, Larry, here's your bonus-round question...
- Can you identify this sound?
- *PWOINK*
- Huh
- BOY, that sounds familiar.
- PWOINK I tell you all my troubles, Garfield...
- And the problem is that you can't interact. Not so, Jon.
- The problem is that I don't care.
-
- My gums hurt. FINALLY! SOME EXCITEMENT!!! Yes, I need to see the dentist.
- Jon Arbuckle.
- Yes, ""the screamer"". Dear Blog:
-
- Teeth whitener. You're burning my retinas. Hey there, beautiful.
- What?!...oh, I'm sorry.
- Wrong number. That was Bob the Butcher. Way to ruin our bacon connection! I want to set a good example.
- BURP!
- So everyone please lower your standards. * beedle beedle beedle
- Jon, how about going out for dinner tonight? Liz
- Sure! Sounds great! tic tic tic itc
- Let's go to that Italian place. They have the BEST lasagna.
- Good choice!
- Ho, Jon! It's me!
- Did I leave my phone here? ...and huge doggie bags! Uh-oh. Liz makes my heart pound.
- And makes me sweaty and weak in the knees.
- I think it's love. Or malaria. Know what you should never do?
- Stuff popcorn in your ears. Good advice.
- Huh? Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows I'm alive.
- I mean, do I really exist?
- Did you hear something, Garfield? She's good for him. I love being with you, Liz. Why, thank you.
- I'm so happy. Me too.
- Would it be inappropriate to break into song? Yes. Jon and I went out tonight, Garfield.
-
- He danced. Sorry you had to see that. I was thinking about us, Jon.
- Wondering what the future holds. Yeah!
- Maybe we'll have ice cream! Can I get in on this?!
- It's too bad that we don't have a butler.
- He could answer the door.
- He could serve us our meals.
- He could call us ""Sir"".
- But it'll never happen.
- Right, Garfield? That's ""sir"" to you. Z
- Z
- I shaved my eyebrows! I hate mondays. You look a little down, Garfield.
- Maybe it's time foooor...
- OOO! EEE! OOO! EEE! OOO! EEE! Yes, folks, the happy monkey dance. I can't wait till friday. I have a date with Liz!
-
- Is it friday yet?! Where did I put the tranquilizer darts? What a great morning, Garfield.
- I feel like I can conquer the world!
- I rule! Said the man in the Happy Pony pajamas. Know what I like about you, Jon?
- My exceptional flossing?
- The way I can cross just one eye? You're different. Here, Odie, you forgot your suitcase.
-
- You also forgot to leave.
- Would you like a donut, Liz? I'd LOVE one.
- But I really shouldn't.
- So you WOULD like a donut? Absolutely.
- But you don't WANT one? No! No, no, NO!
-
- Women. They're a mystery. Gonna sneeze.
- WAH-CHOO!
- Good one. In the future, cats will ruke the world.
-
- Still. ""Dear ask a dog...""
- ""How come you're so slow?""
- Signed, ""Squirrel in the backyard"". YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! Great news, Garfield!
- I'm writing a polka opera!
- Not enough cotton in the world! Liz thinks I'm sweet.
- Of course she does.
- It's because he's as bright as a powdered donut. Cats know life.
-
- That's why we avoid it.
- Liz, I think Garfield has a little cabin fever.
- I think we all get that this time of year, Jon.
- Besides, how bad could it be?
- AAAAAAAAGGG
- GGGGGHHHHHH
- Wanna come over? Sure, how does june sound? I'm so happy!
- I have a girlfriend, a faithful dog, and a...
- Now I'm depressed. Maybe fixing lunch for your cat will cheer you up.
-
- Did you have your dinner? I'm considering it. Why do I do this, you ask? BOOT!
- GLRRD
- I'm a fan of funny noises. There goes Mrs. Feeny with her poor cat on a leash.
- Is there anything sadder?
- Except maybe the matching outfits! Who wants a cat treat?
- Garfield?
- How about you? Ask Jon. I have sophisticated tastes.
- GULP
- That was food. Ahhh...
- It's sunday, Garfield! Today I'm not going to do ANYthing...just like you.
- * RIIMNG
- Hi, Jon, it's Liz.
- Hi, Liz!
- Want to do something today? Sure! I'll be right over!
- SLAP! Rookie. I believe in making plans.
- Lots and lots of plans.
- Shouldn't you be doing something? Can't you see I'm busy? RRRRR
- You're wearing booties.
- My toesies are cold. I can't let you bark at me today. I'm reevaluating things, Garfield.
- What's really important? Okay...
- Is it my rugged good looks? Or your vivid imagination? Good morning, Garfield.
- You were sleepwalking last night.
- Doinf ballet moves. Must have been the swan I ate. I wrote a love song for Liz.
- It's called ""I'll stay with you forever...
- ...even if you try to lose me in a shopping mall"". Based on a true story. ""Nothing ventured...
- no effort expended"".
- Cat wisdom. Sigh
-
- SIIIIIGH
- There, there, Garfield...
- I know you miss it...we all do.
- Just hang in there, pal. It'll be back again before you know it!
- Spring? The ice cream truck. A cat can have fun with just a piec of string.
-
- Not this piece of string, however. Odie's burying his bone. I have a bad feeling.
- Wait, I didn't give him a bone. A really bad feeling.
- And where's the remote? A really, REALLY bad feeling. Look at the pretty spring flowers, Garfield.
- They whisper happy thoughts to us.
- Spring is disturbing. It's a sunny day.
- No wind, perfect temperature...
- Why the long face? There is nothing to complain about. Big date with Liz tonight!
- And in case there's a lull in conversation...
- Puppets! That should raise the creepy factor. Gee hee hee hee hee
- GOO! HOO! HOO! HOO! HOO! GAA! BWAH! HAW! HAW! HAW!
- You are watching the Laughing Baby Channel. This always cheers me up.
- SLURK! SLURK! SLURRRRK!
- SLUUUUUUUUUUU
- UUUUUUUUUUUUU
- UUURRRRRRRRRRR
- RRRRRRKKK
- OKAY! OKAY! I'LL BUY MORE LEMONADE!! And another bendy straw. This one is all slurked out. Z
- Z
- I gave myself a wedgie getting dressed this morning. I hate mondays. The garden is a success!
- I think I'll call him ""Ed"".
- OR not. He didn't mean it, ""Loretta"". Odie is a nice dog.
- He licks my face.
- You never lick my face. I hardly know you. Don't mess with me, cat. I brought a bodyguard with me today.
- Say hello to Bernie.
- Bernie? Yo. Liz, I feel like doing manly things today.
- Like eating junk food and watching sports!
- We're going shopping. Manly shopping, no doubt. Sir?
- Sir?!
- YES! YES! I'LL HAVE FRIES! Oh, the pressure. munch munch munch
- Welcome back to ""When Wildlife Snaps!""
- Here we see a hungry bear approaching a camper...
- Who forgot to keep his food in a high, safe place. munch munch
- RAAWRRR! AIYEE!
-
- munch munch munch
- STEP JUST A LITTLE CLOSER
- That can't be anything good. ""If space aliens were to invade earth, they could take the form of animals.""
-
- Have you come in peace? Take me to your refrigerator. You cats are spooky, Garfield.
- Some say you can read minds.
- Well, not with my brain-wave blocking helmet, buddy boy! Now for my escape... Why dogs bury bones is a mystery.
-
- Why they dig them back up is an even bigger mystery. The computer is a wonderful thing.
- For instance...
- If I turn it off, I can see an excellent refelction of myself. I never made it to my date with Liz.
- The wind was against me.
- Liz is one lucky woman. WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA!
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
-
- WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA!
- HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE
- ""Finicky Eating Habits of the Cat""
- WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA! pound pound pound
-
- Cat push-ups. Garfield, it's time.
- Time to clean the kitchen.
- The cockroaches are wearing party hats. Lot of birthdays today. BARK!
- Whoa. That was perfect! One bark? One lousy bark?!
- No way to improve on that one... You're going to take a nap, aren't you? A great meal...a nap...can life get better?
- BURP!
- Okay...NOW can life get better? Liz and I are leaving, Garfield.
- Garfield?
- That's strange. I can't lift the picnic basket. Oh, Jon... Madam Gortez Fortune-Telling?
- Can you tell me what my future holds?
- Z Hey, wake up! She's good. tappity tappity tappity tappity
- tappity tappity tappity tappity
- tappity tappity tappity tappity
- tappity tappity tappity tappity
- tappity tappity tappity tappity
- tappity tappity tappity tappity
- I gotta stop drinking coffee after dinner! I should get up.
- Will I? Won't I?
- Savor the suspense, people. Learning is its own reward.
- Seriously?
- I found a dollar in a book once. Ah. Fetch the stick, Odie.
- CLONK! OW!
- Fetch the blame, Odie. I made toast. Do you want a slice? Sure.
- Butter? Sure.
- There's that weird face again. You seem down, Liz.
- I'll bet I can make you smile.
- I could fall off the roof! Again? Seen it. Liz and I dined by candlelight.
- We gazed into each other's eyes.
- Then my tie burst into flames. I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.
-
-
-
-
- HELLO, MISTER SPRINGTIME!!
- ...and he's ALL yours! The world does not revolve around you.
- You got that right, pal.
- Because I told the world not to! No one ever listens to me.
- Hello?!
- They hung up... Self-esteem hotline. I've almost got you, cat!
- Mailman!
- Thank goodness for short attention spans. SQUIRREL! COUGH! COUGH!
- Garfield! I was choking on a peanut, and you just sat there!
- We have peanuts?! Who's going to say it first?
- Okay, I declare a tie!
- You BOTH love me! Good morning, Mister Butterfly...
- THOT!
- Good morning, Mister Truck.
-
-
-
- KONK
- I was feeling blue.
- But Jon fixed that.
- Now I'm creeped out. Here's a letter from a man whose best friend is actually a cat!
- He likes stamp collecting and plaid.
- Tell me you didn't sign it. Look, he even signed his name!
- BOO!
- Oh, real funny! Beware Of Do..---... Jon's trying his hand at gardening.
- AIEEE!
- LADYBUGS!
- You knew the risks, man! I went shopping, Liz.
- And I bought you a hat! Don't look at me...
- IT's the Exctinct Species Collection! I dodn't make you date him, lady! Cats are natural hunters.
- Lying in tall grass, waiting for prey...
- ...tying to stay awake.
- WARNING:
- BEWARE OF DOG
- WHO THINKS HE'S A LAPDOG
-
- WHOOMP
- Not a good morning, Garfield.
- I tied my shoelaces together!
- Now I have to take tiny steps! You're going to have to start paying me to live here. How would I describe Jon?
- A daydreamer...kind..gentle...
- ...loves gum. BEWARE OF THE DOG
- TAKE ONE
- BARK! ...so he says, ""that was no aardvark, that was my wife!""
- boo! boo! boo! boo! boo! boo! boo! boo! boo! boo!
- Even the crickets are booing. Garfield, I feel refreshed!
- I feel alive!
- HOOOW ARE YOOOU? HUUUH? New mouthwash. First message...Jon, this is Liz.
- I'm relly looking forward to our date.
- Oh, yeah, and leave the accordio at home. Rats! She's good.
- I found this in the back of the refrigerator. I wonder if it's any good.
- Here, Odie. Try some.
- MMMMMMMMMM
- mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
-
- Never use a dog as taste tester. Garfield, it's a beautiful day!
- I'm putting you outside!
- You can scamper about! Perhaps he's forgotten that cats have retractable claws? vroom!
- vroom!
- You aren't fooling anybody! Nope
- Not here either.
- Where is that stupid mower?! I found the paperboy. Bark!
- That's it? ONE bark?
- Yeah, but it was perfection. Hey, but I know lazy when I see it. Did you notice someone cleaned your kitchen?
- Well?!
- Elves DO exist!! Quick, Jon! To the escape pod! So, Liz, I'm thinking about laminating my stamp collection.
- What do you think?
- I thibk she hung up. LIKE AN HOUR AGO!
-
-
-
-
-
- xoplbrqzdafelknmcsjg The world would be a better place if spiders were in charge.
- SMACK!
- For starters, THERE WOULD BE LESS OF THIS! Say, if you're done with the paper...
- I'd like to read the comics.
- That was too obvious, wasn't it? Nice try, though. Got some news for you, cat.
- You HAVE to be nice to us now...
- We have a hostage! FIENDS! (burp) Ah, what a great meal.
- You, had a big ol' juicy fly.
- Love those body fluids. Hey! I'm eating here! COOKIES
- Chocolate chip
- A good scout is invaluable. On to the candy bowl. *
- Don't you vets take some kind of OATH?!! COOKIES
-
- WOOP WOOP
-
-
- WOOP WOOP
- We're having some trust issues. Life is full of regrets, Garfield. How true.
- Do you have any regrets? Yes, I do.
- Maybe stealing food? Kicking Odie off the table? Squashing spiders? I never learned to type. I've invented the pie-cake-pie!
-
- Mmm. Not bad, although it's not quite as good as the cake-pie-cake! Oh, YUCK!
- There's a tooth in my soup!
- WE FOUND IT, SMILEY! I love happy endings. I have no energy, Garfield.
- Maybe I should work out...
- Or take a nap. Come to the dark side, Jon. You're easy to talk to, Liz.
- I could talk to you for hours.
- click Hello? It's not nice to threaten people, Jon. I was trapped!
- I couldn't breathe!
- Finally I was able to break free! That dental floss should have a warning label. Z
- Z**
-
-
- Garfield, do you have to be so annoying?
- Yes. I refer you to page 137 of the Standard Cat Owner Agreement. Jon is down in the dumps.
- And I know just what to do about that.
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Finally, the house is clean.
-
- Ah, the circle of life. sniff sniff
- That's odd.
- Odie's breath smells good. Chasing your toothpaste with your cologne will do that. I'm back from the pet store. Do tell...
- I bought you something fun! I'm giddy.
- Fake dog ears! This is why good cats go bad. I love a man who can make me laugh, Jon.
- Yes, I do have a sense of humor.
- I'm talking about your wardrobe. I have no emails or messages. Gee.
- This can only mean one thing... You have no friends?
- Alien abductions? Take him! Take him!
-
-
-
-
-
- Pizza's here! 'bout time! It's a beautiful day!
-
- But the plot is weak. My Uncle Forrest would say, ""you can't know someone..
- until you've walked a mile in their shoes"".
- He had three hundred pairs when they caught him. That's about a seven on the creepy scale. Here's a picture of you as a kitten, Garfield.
- You were so cute. I hate cute.
- But for me I'll make an exception. Hello. I'm the age nightmare scheduled for this evening.
- I think you want the guy in the bedroom down the hall. Thank you very much.
- Pretty polite, for a bald spot. GAAAH Age nightmare? Oh, yeah.
- You're a 45 R.P.M. record...I remember you. Precisely!
- BWAAHHH-HA-HA-HA-HAAAAAHHHH! My age nightmare is a sieve? That's right!
- I'm your....um...your....uh...........your....wait, don't tell me....
- My memory? Yeah! Yeah! That's it!
- Welcome to your age nightmare, birthday boy!
- Readig glasses? Why are you scary? Because when you need me...
- You'll never remember where you PUT me! BWAH-HA-HA-HA-HAAAAH!
- Sorry, still not scary. Oh, no? Just wait, it gets worse!
-
- Who are you? I'm the CHAIN that holds him around your NECK. BWAH-HA-HAAAAAA! Nothing can stop me today!
-
- Except for that forgetting-what-I-was-going-to-do thing... Jon got me gift.
-
- He doesn't know it yet. You must be my birthday nightmare. That's right.
- Why only one candle? Doctor's order.
- Last year I pulled a hamstring.
-
- I got a new, extra-long chain. You don't say. I can't wait to see you, Liz.
- I can't kiss you over the phone.
- Oh, okay...smoochie, smoochie. Wire cutters...I need wire cutters. Is lying there all you can do?
- BURP!
- You disgust me. I can wiggle my toes, too. ENTER ---->
- Okay, let's see...
- oooooooooooo
- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
- EEEEEEEE
- EEEEEEEE THUNK!
- I am NEVER taking you to a warehouse club again! I love you, barrel of cheeseballs! kiss kiss kiss You know, Garfield...
- I've made a few mistakes in my aardvark.
- I mean ""life"". NOooooo...
- BURP
- Better go fill up again. Beware of the vicious big honking dog!
- And the eight gazillion-volt electric fence! And the tyrannosaurus rex!
- You should be ashamed! You weren't supposed to get this far.
-
- Why don't you just let go? Having a cape doesn't mean I can fly! Liz enjoys my company.
- I can understand that...
- Some people enjoy broccoli, too! The monster! It's alive!
-
- And he enjoys gardening.
- Monsters shouldn't wear sun bonnets. Hey, guys. Hey, Irma.
- SURPRISE!
- It's customer appreciation day!
- You get a ""we finally passed our health inspection"" balloon...
- An ""I heart mystery meat"" T-Shirt...
- And something really special...
- An all-day antacid! I'm gett ing all misty... There are jungle cats and house cats.
- One thing separates the two.
- Scented kitty litter. Jungle cats are barbarians. Cats love milk, Garfield. We do?
- Lap it up! Any cereal to go with this?
- You're not lapping. Or some sugar, corn starch, cocoa powder, salt, and egg yolks and we can make chocolate pudding. I don't feel like cooking, Garfield.
- I'll just open a can or something.
- ""Critter parts"". Any port in a storm. Big date with Liz tonight.
- I'm wearing my special tie.
- Pull this and it explodes! Allow me. Every morning I wake up and think...
- ""Today is a new and exciting day!""
- Than I see you. They don't call me ""Mr. Reality"" for nothing, pal. MINE! Poor Jon...
- I GOT IT! I GOT IT! Will he ever learn?
- YEEOOWW! ""Catch the pineapple"". SMACK!
- SMACK!
- WHACK!
- WHOP!
- SWAT!
- SPLAT!
- Six flies, three spiders, one gnat, two grasshoppers, four moths and an earwig!
- Burgers are done! Oh, no thanks! Sometimes things just don't get right for me.
- There's a word for that...
- ""Life"". That's new.
- There was a sign here last week...
- ""Beware of falling rocks"". Garfield, I am calling you...
- I am the lasagna.
- NOT! Meat loaf is cruel. I have deep thoughts, Garfield.
- I should write them down.
- Where are my crayons? Next to your army guys. Garfield hid my car keys.
- But, HA! I found them!
- Uh, Garfield? Where is the car? The game is afoot! If you wait patiently...
-
- Complete boredom will arrive.
- Come on...come on...
- I'll be late for my date with Liz!
- HONK! HONK! HONK!
- THANKS FOR DRIVING SO LOW, YOU MOUTH-BREATHING, KNUCKLE-DRAGGING, PEA-BRAINED IDIOT! YOU...
- ...ooo
- You say this is the lates fashion trend? It's called ""Knuckle-Dragger Chic"".
- Gah. Urf.
- And so the day begins. I've fallen in the old well!
- If only there were a CAT who could save me!
- Timmy must have landed on his head. Jon says he has a major announcement.
- Like I care...
- I've gone electric! Okay, I care a little. Help! Help! I'm stuck in a tree!
- Help! Help! I'm going to fall!
- I like to warm up before I get started. Garfield likes it when you come over, Liz.
- How can you tell?
- He's awake. Yeah, we should erect a statue in her honor.
-
- Why is everything wrinkled? It's called ""The Odie Effect"". Sigh...
- I remember our family trips.
- There's cousin Earl.
- He was accidentally left at a rest stop.
- He was missing for years.
- As it turned out, he was adopted by a pack of wolves.
- We got a postcard. ""I have acquired a taste for small game."" Garfield, I found Pooky!
- Whoa! What's happening?!
- Those latent urges die hard. My invention will benefit the world...
- Lifting the yoke of oppression from pet owners everywhere!
- The portable litter box! Vengeance will be mine. ODIE! Her, Odie! Her, boy! ODIE!
- WHY IS He IGNORING ME?!
- Can this day get any better?
- Ants have eaten all of your tofu.
- Well, yes it can! Liz and I have become very close.
- We share our deepest secrets.
- Should I tell her about my limited fashoin sense? I think she knows.
- YOU PUT MY GOLDFISH IN MY SHOE!
- It's his birthday. Huh...
- This article says that you can learn a lot from your cat.
- You should try it.
-
- GULP! CHOMP! SNARF!
- BURRRP
- Z I have taught him well. A kid stopped me today.
- He asked if I was old.
- I tied his shoelaces together. You have some good years left, my friend. beep
- I just got a text!
- ""I have an itch"". My right ear. Cats know things.
- For instance, I can tell that Odie's been digging.
- It's like I'm psychic! Pudding for everybody!
- Steaks on the house! A round of drinks for everyone!
- Well? I love romance.
- I love fudge.
- You are a piece of work. Okay, your turn. Jon, you should plan for the future.
- I made you a list of goals.
- I don't see cowboy on here. That explains the hitching post out back.
- I bet if I pull my big-eyes routine on Liz, I can get a snack out of her.
-
-
-
-
- She's good.
- Fascinating!
- I must be doing this wrong. Today we sent a cat into space.
- This served no scientific purpose...
- But there's one less cat on the planet! This does not bode well... Let the workout begin!
- I bought a set of weights.
- Arrrgh! I can't get them out of the car! Let the workout end! Jon is having thoughts.
- Deep thoughts.
- Do birds have fingers? Deep, disturbing thoughts. I wish Liz were here.
-
- And you weren't. FOR ONCE, WE AGREE! I know that accusing look.
- This can't be good.
- Forty-three goldfish?!! He found my diary!
-
-
-
-
-
- Garfieeeld... Oh, sure, blame the coach...uh, I mean cat. Garfield, you'll never believe... What's that?!
- Excude me, I'm needed in surgery!
- I an NOT boring! Hello? Hello?
- Hello?
- At least once a week, Jon tries to make a phone call with the TV remote. Hello? Here comes the ice cream man.
- Just in time.
- Bill Brick wants a fudge bar. Garfield, Garfield, Garfield... That's my name. Don't wear it out.
- Have you no control?! Give me a subject.
- Did you enjoy the wax fruit?! Chewy, tasteless, yet satisfying. Liz is here, Garfield.
- She's helping me with my wardrobe.
- Do you smell smoke? Free at last!
- You're in my chair.
- I'm sitting in cat hair! Let the punishment fit the crime! Ahhhhh
-
-
- Oh, all right! You can come in, too!
- But just ONE pool toy!
-
- It's so hot outside, you sweat just standing still!
-
- Finally, an exercise program for YOU. Except for that sweating part. Jon isn't going to be happy.
- Woo hoo! Woo hoo!
- The mice have been frolicking in his stamp collection. I'm Bolivia!
-
- Grab the string, Garfield! Only if it opens a trapdoor. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the...
- Wait...before you even get started...
- You're fat. Where's my brick? What are you thinking about, Garfield?
- Why don't they make tuna-flavored ice cream?
- Nothing romantic? You wouldn't LOVE that?! Liz is spending the week with her parents.
- Jon was very supportive.
- Then the car pulled away.
- HUHHHHHHH
- FUH FUH FUH FUH
- FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH
- FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH
- CLAP
- It's time for the *bee-dee-dee-dee-dee* cat weather report.
- I'm not leaving the house, so the weather doesn't matter.
- This has been the *bee-dee-dee-dee-dee* cat weather report. We should go for a drive, Garfield.
- A drive in the country.
- We can look at a cow! Medium or well done? Don't you wish you could do this?
- WHACK! SPLAT!
- Doesn't look safe. You got THAT right! I joined a book club, Garfield! Soon my brain will expand!
- But then I won't be able to wear hats!
- And then I can't be a cowboy!!! Step away from the book, Tex. MY ACCORDION IS MISSING!
- Oh, my. How tragic.
- Can you imagine anything more tragic than that, Garfield? No, nothing more tragic than that. Saaay... Jump back! Who is this guy?!
- I'm a wild man!
- Didn't comb his hair. Sigh...
- I wish you coulfd talk, Garfield...
- Then we could REALLY communicate.
- We could have discussions, and share deep thoughts.
- I wonder what wisdom you woul dimpart to me if you could talk right now...what would you say?
- CLOP
- Yeah, words are overrated. They just get in the way. I would appreciate a little respect.
-
- You're going to make fun of me when I leave the room, aren't you? Why wait? BURP!
- Garfield, in the history of disgusting noises...
- THAT is number one. I'd like to thank the academy. When I was young, Garfield...
- My brother and I made our own excitement.
- One toime we exchanged underwear. I believe that this qualifies as animal abuse. Mr. Arbuckle, here's my bill for cleaning your refrigerator.
- Why so much? I lost two of my best men in there. No match for the meat loaf. Really, Liz, I love all animals.
-
- Even the fat, lazy, disgusting ones. I heard that. I feel like biting somebody!
- Socks don't have teeth.
- Then maybe I'll bunch up inside a shoe. That'll work. I have a business proposition for you...
- I'll pay you five bones...and make it look like an accident.
- Gotcha, where is he? Hey, Nermal!
- Meet my big friend.
- AWWWWWWWWWWWWW
- You BEAST! How COULD you?!
- What happened to you? I hate cute... STOP IT! HA! HA! HA!
- HAW! HAW! HAW! STOP IT!! HEE HEE HEE!
- Okay, I'm done tickling myself. Please pay the cable bill. Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity.
- BONK!
- Shortly before discovering the lawsuit! That was odd.
- I was just hugged by a stranger.
- It must be National Hug Day! Actually, it's National Check-Your-Wallet Day. Garfield, I'm setting a trap for the mice.
- Three...two...one...
- SNAP! YEOOW! Sound the allclear Clothes shopping is fun, isn't it, Garfield?
- New pants brighten the day.
- So cheer up. I hate my life. Liz and I are going dancing.
- Oh, I forgot!
- Cha-cha-cha! The woman's a saint.
- ARF! ARF! ARF! What's wrong, boy?
- ARF! ARF! ARF! Is it Timmy? Is he in the well?
- Yes! That rotten kid is in the well!
- AND I PUSHED HIM! REFUSED TO GIVE ME A NUM-NUM, WILL HE? I SHOWED HIM! I SHOWED EVERYONE!
- MWA-HAHAHA!
- Uh...I mean ""arf""? Boy...you think you know someone... Garfield, let's take a moment to ponder life.
-
- My foot itches. I gues we're doing pondering. DANGER
- BEWARE OF THE...
- FINE PRINT! Okay, now I'm intimidated. Gee, what's this? An empty fish bowl? Feigned surprise.
- Maybe they grew legs and ran away! Right into sarcasm.
- You should stop eating my goldfish, Garfield! Now the crazy talk. Garfield, I'm missing out on life.
- I don't have a witty circle of friends...
- Who paint their bodies and head-butt each other... Too many sports commercials. What do you see in the future for us, Jon?
- Dinner.
- I mean after that. Dessert! Hip people don't follow trends, Garfield.
- They create trends.
- My shirt is tucked into my boxer shorts! I'm alerting the trend police.
- slurp...
-
- BOOM!
- What waa THAT?!
- And where's Odie?
- You mean the ""Canine Cannonball""? I worry about the future, Garfield.
- Life is so unpredictable.
- What if I forget how to speak?! Don't try to cheer me up. Here's a picture form high school.
- Look at the girls.
- Remember when petticoats were in style? On what planet was that? Good evening, folks!
- Tonight I would like to class up my act by singing opera. BOOO!
- Or I could juggle puppies. YAY! I think it's time to clean the refrigerator.
- Every time I open the door...
- The music stops. I like the disco ball. Hi, Liz!
- How'y my fuzzy wuzzy rubby bubby?
- Okay, the nicknames need work. Rookie. There's a pea in my mashed potatoes!
- Now the whole meal is ruined!
- Sometimes it's too easy.
-
-
- RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE RAKE
- There!
- I wonder where Garfield is? BOOT! Just look at this world, Garfield. I'm...
- It's NOT a small world. Not...
- You just make it seem that way! Fat. I went to the doctor today.
- He told me to lose a few pounds.
- How about a little sympathy, here? I'm weeping on the inside. Okay, so we both got on a diet.
- We'll encourage each other.
- Any supportive thoughts? YEAH! LET'S EAT! Know what's good about dieting, Garfield?
- You walk down the street...
- And people yell ""Hey there, slender person!"" It must be some scret society! I bought a new scale, Garfield.
- It doesn't need batteries.
- It's solar powered! Hello, Fatso. I must blot out the sun. You've been on a diet for a week, Garfield.
- And you've gained three pounds.
- Care to explain? I ate the diet book.
- Oh, I know that look, you're up to something, aren't you?
- Either that, or you've already done it, and it's probably something HORRIBLE, too.
- Something horrible and shocking that I'm likely to find by accident any MINUTE now!
- YAAAAAAAH!!
- That was fun...
- I must get food stuck in my teeth more often. I could climb you.
- And there's nothing you can do about it!
- Unfortunately... Oh, look, the cat's stuck in a tree. Aw, poor kitty.
- Let's peck his fingers. No! Let's tickle him!
- Or grease the limb! Or saw it off! Shouldn't you be migrating?
- poink
- Quitter! Leaves...
- Rake...
- Cover the rake with the leaves. Liz, I lied about my past.
- Actually, I've had thousands of girlfriends.
- Okay, I'm still lying! And the hole gets deeper. Garfield, THIS is a scratching post.
- You dig your claws in...
- And go like this! If you don't want me to use your nail file, just say so.
- I had a dream about us last night, Garfield.
- We were having a picnic, eating sanwiches in a beautiful forest glen...
- When suddenly, a huge bear jumped out and attacked us!
- Than you sprang in to cation, fought him off with your bare paws, swept me into your arms, and accried me to safety!
- Isn't that romantic? Yeah, but...
- What kind of sanwiches were they? YAWN
- I'm tired.
- I stayed up too late last afternoon.
-
- You are not the pool. Look! Tiny lounge chairs! Dog Kisses $1.00
-
- Towels $2.00 Ah, family heirlooms.
- As the eldest son...
- I now wear the family hat. Do you know where that thing has been? I like Liz.
- She's kind, considerate...
- And has long fingernails. Welcome to ""Teen Polka Party""!

- Time to recharge. It's a rainy monday morning.
- However, I'm a cat and I don't have to get out of bed.
- Don't hate me. It's been a tough day, Garfield.
- But remember my motto...
- ""Ninjas never cry"". Their cats, on the other hand... Odie is angry with me.
-
- Take my word for it. I'm feeling down, Pooky. Any words of encouragement?
- No?
- Pooky's just ""there"". Remember when we met, Liz? Yes.
- Let's re-create that moment.
- Hi, I'm Jon. You're standing on my foot. Gee, isn't this lovely.
- A cat hair in my soup!
- What could be worse?! My hairnet? I'm cute, and you're not. Is that so?
- I can be just as cute as you, Nermal.
- Oh, yeah? Prove it. Just watch me.
-
- AWWWWWWWWWWW
- Poor dear, did you eat a sick mouse?
- You were saying? Go choke on a rainbow. Give my creature LIFE!
- ...GIVE MY CREATURE LIFE!!!
- Monster movie? Man trying to wake a cat. Count Dracula, table for one?
- Right this way, please...
- Would you like to see a neck list? No, zenk you. He's a regular.
- Arrrrr...
- ROOOO! We should never have let Odie watch that werewolf movie. The vampire cat sleeps all day.
- He also sleeps at night. Z
- They're not really that dangerous. Do you believe in ghosts?
- WHERE?!
- I mean, no. No, I don't. Ask him about his 23 nightlights. The moon is full and hair is growing on my body!
- Hair in my ears! Up my nose!
- What's happening to me?! ""Curse of the middle-aged man""...
-
-
-
-
-
- * It's cold, windy and raining outside.
-
- Outside is stupid. Modern technology is a wondrous thing.
- I've forgotten how to turn the computer on!
- But it will never replace good old-fashoined dumb. !FRA -!FRA !FRA !FRA !FRA !FRA
- !FRA !FRA !FRA Odie, stop barking at the mirror. The mice wanted to go camping.
- AIEEE!!
- I said they could stay in Jon's slippers. Let's go do something, tonight.
- Okay.
- You'll have to stare off into space yourself. I'll manage.
- You miss a lot of things.
- A lot of things miss me. pssssht!
- gluck gluck gluck gluck gluck gluck gluck gluck

- Not everything is a contest, you know! . Said the loser. Garfield, let's make the most of this day.
- Let's live it to the fullest.
- Let's open the curtains! Jon! There's sunshine out there! I'll have a Happy Burger.
- And the fat lady in the fur coat?
- DONK HUNGRY CAT!
- Oh, man, am I glad that he's...
- THIRSTY DOG! Garfield, we're in a rut.
- We need to spice things up.
- I'm changing our name to Roscoe! Claw time. Some men look good in hats.
-
- I wonder what she meant by that. Some men would know. Garfield, let's see if we can communicate.
- Concentrate and focus!
- I'm sensing relaxation... Z ***

- You have three new messages.
- First message:
- squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak
- I am ALWAYS losing that thing! GARFIELD! Found it. Pets are supposed to amuse, Garfield. That's an ugly rumor.
- You do not amuse.
- You'd better start. You want amusement? Get a monkey. Have you ever taken a good, hard look at yourself?
-
- I said... Hang on. Hi, I'm a plump little chipmunk!
- Would you like to play?
- I like to roll in mustard! Is this a sting operation? Here's a good saying, Garfield.
- ""Failure is not an optin"". True that.
- Around here it's a way of life. Liz, why do you love me?
- I have my reasons.
- My ninja skills? WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?! Jon's depressed.
- He feels alone and scorned...
- Nobody will jam with me. AND for good reason. growlll
- I'm hungry.
- Are you hungry?
- Me? Hungry?
- Wow, that's a toughie...
- Yessiree, that's a real stumper, that is.
- Gosh, let me think... Thank you, Captain Sarcasm. Good morning, Mr. Grumpy.
- Nothing you can do can spoil my good mood today.
- * DING! Is that the toaster? Your slippers are done. Yes, I have a cat.
- Yes, he's big and orange.
- Yes ,he's wearing a necklace made out of canary feathers! In some cultures this signifies a rite of passage. I'm back from the store, Garfield.
- Let's see...I got milk...eggs...bread...
- And a ninja outfit! And people wonder why the economy is bad. I remember family holidays.
- Uncle Joe would do his magic act.
- He made the fruitcake disappear. No great loss there. Jon, why are you staring at me?
- I can't take my eyes of you, Liz.
- Could you at least blink? That's the way I stare at strawberry shortcake. Garfield, you look depresse.
- Pondering a life unfulfilled? Yes.
- I've never eaten a pelican. Sigh...
- You haven't played with me in a long time.
- You USED to bat me around all day long...now you just IGNORE me!
- Oh, please... Well, *I* know when I'm not wanted!
- I'm going home to my mother!
- ...mother?
- My old school report card.
- Let's ee what it says.
- ""Jon is a dull boy"". And so the legend began. Doc Boy and I were crazy teenagers.
- We used to drag race.
- I painted flames on the tractor! Cool, yet pathetic.
- WHIRRRRR
- Enough with the hair dryer wars! Victory is mine! Garfield, we are prepared.
- Ready for any disaster.
- We have enough egg salad to last for years! I love disasters! My aunt Orpha used to say, ""Christmas comes but once a year"".
- Then she'd say, ""never get under the mistletoe with a molting chicken"".
- Then she'd play the spoons on her forehead. Aunt Orpha was a few walnuts shy of a fruitcake. ""It was a stormy night...""
-
- There aren't any pictures. Is there a remote?
- Garfield! Odie! Get in here!
- We're taking our Christmas card photo...
- And we want everyone in it!
-
- The pizza guy? He's like family. I got my Christmas tree, Liz. It's covered with sticky sap.
- Good, that means it's freshly cut. Where did you put it?
- Right now it's in the kitchen. Pass the cream, pine boy.
-
- Bring on the candy canes! Okay, I'll proofread your letter to Santa!
- Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
- It's a little repetitious, isn't it? But it drives the point home, though. Don't you think? xvlpdiuangepwjkud<#zhdaiow;hefgbelr(jhlSdbbaceiu%
- send How cute. He thinks he's writing a letter to Santa.
- One squeaky bone! Your Christmas lights look great, Jon! Thanks!
- And I only fell off the ladder TWICE this year!
- Our little boy is growing up. * Fa-la-la-la-laaaaah, la-la-lah
-
- SMACK
- I was TOLD there would be flies and cocoa! Garfield
-
-
- shake shake shake shake
-
- No Peeking
- Did you find my decoy? Well played, Arbuckle. Garfield, your letter to Santa is deplorable!
- It's full of half-truths and outright lies! What?!
- How'd a half-truth get in there?! Did you ask Santa to bring you anything, Jon?
- Oh, YEAH!
- We just got an e-mail from Jon's girlfriend. Cancel the leisure suit. ...you be good now, Sonny, and I'll remember what you asked for! Thanks, Spider Claus!
- Ho! Ho! Ho! ...next!
- All right, I've hidden your present again.
- And THIS time I've...
- STOP THAT! under the bed...how cliche. Why don't you hide Garfield's present on top of your exercise machine? He'd NEVER look there.
-
- The thing you hang your shirts on. Oh, THAT! Yes, mom, I guess you could say that Liz and I are serious.
- How serious?
- She makes me clean my house. Somebody book a chapel!

- Hey, I LIKE that Christmas song! How's the farm, dad? The hog has bronchitis. Listen.
- HOINK! HOINK!
- I'm listening to a sick pig. That's no way to talk about family.
- X
- AAAAGGGHH slurp slurp slurp slurp slurp slurp slurp Merry Christmas, Jon! Merry Christmas, Odie!
- Where's Garfield? Merry Christmas, me! Exercise is a great way to stay warm.
- That's true...
- This works, too. I think our dish should be done now...let's check the oven.
-
- 60-inch, high-definition lasagna. Towel, please. Winter is nice.
- The snow...the crisp air...
- My socks are wet. Let the whining season begin!
- pat pat pat pat pat pat
- AWWWWWWW
- AWWWWWWW
- AWWWWWWW
- Even my snowman is cuter than yours. It it not!
- AWWWWWWW
- Lovable pet coming through.
- You forgot to purr. I'll mail it to you. There comes a time when you have to assess yourself...
- I'm awesome!
- I should have done that years ago. We all have our faults, Garfield.
- However, some may have more faults than others.
- Waaaay more. Is this leading to a compliment? What if the world explodes?
- What if these are my final moments?
- And I'm spending them with a cat?! If there were a button, I'd push it. You sure are good-looking.
- Yes, I am!
- Garfield... Psst, it would be wise to say something nice to Liz, as well. I like to avoid learning something new every day.
- Here's something interesting. Whoa!
- Whew! That was close!
- Eat meeee.
- eeeeat me. Sigh...
- Jon, you've gotta help me. Eeeeat meeee. You're weakening, aren't you?
- Look, we agreed this wouldn't be easy...we BOTH have to be strong.
- Eeeeat meeee.
- DONUT BARN The heck with the resolution. Garcon, another dozen. I burned the toast...
- On purpose!
- Another hostile monday morning. Did you see my list of ways to keep the house cleaner?
- Yes, I did, Jon.
- And I wiped my feet on it. Why do dogs dig holes?
- A primal search for food?
- Or stashing their comic book collections? WHEEE!
- WHEEEE!!
- Told you! I still say waxing the floor is no fun. Jon's listening to a recording.
- I made it myself.
- I call it ""Claws on a Blackboard"". I'm turning into a cat!
- Wait. NO, I'm not. I'm just covered with your disgusting cat hair.
- What a disappointment.
-
- Jon, look out the window...
-
- Sigh...isn't that romantic?
- Z
- Z Welcome to my world. Let me show you around.
-
- Come back soon. My high school chums.
- Where are they now?
- What are they doing now? Probably not showing photos to their cats. AROOOOOOO
- All right! I'll fill your dish!
- AROOOOOOO I'm filled with energy today!
- Or, as I refer to it...
- Beint too lazy to be lazy. Liz, I am a man of principle.
- I live by one simple rule.
- Never stick your tongue in a toaster. We live learn. When you eat healthy, you feel healthy.
- I just ate a donut.
- Which is WAAAAY better than feeling healthy. Hmmmmm
- Here's a crazy theory, Garfield.
- ""Cats may be invaders from another planet"".
- I don't think so.
- You're too lazy to make the trip.
- And you'd never escape gravity.
- Certainly not from the planet Fatso. Where is my disintegrator gun when I need it? I wonder how far I can walk...
-
- We may never know.
-
- No tummy rub! Then why do you exist? BEWARE OF DOG
-
- If you please. Thank you. Garfield, I feel unloved.
-
- Thanks. A teddy bear's work is never done. Liz and I are going clothes shopping.
- When I get back...
- I'll be hip! Sooo...how many years will you be gone? I am a mighty hunter.
- I prey on the weak and defenseless.
- Make me a cheeseburger!
-
-
-
-
-
- It's called a SELFIE, guys. There's never a dull moment around here.
-
- There are, however, dull years. LIPS! Here we go.
- LIPS! Same thing every morning..
- I CAN't FEEL MY LIPS! Let the coffee cool, Jon. Some dogs work for a living.
- SLAP!
- Yes, there are dogs even dumber than you. Garfield, this is my life.
- Cleaning up cat hair.
- How sad is that? Now, about my litter box... Well, Liz, I think men are superior to women.
- Well, for one, we're more mature.
- Hey, leave my bunny slippers out of this! Wait till she meets Mr. Blankey. You are not a dweeb.
- You are not a miserable failure.
- You are not ugly. Self-esteem ringtones. OWWOOOOOO clap clap clap clap clap clap
- OWOOOOOOOO clap clap clap clap clap clap
- OOOWOOOOOOOOO clap clap clap clap clap
- OOOOOOWOOOOOOOO clap clap clap clap
- YOWR ROWR ROWR
-
- How was karaoke night? Tough room. Well, hello Mr. Personality!
- Let the good times roll! Woo hoo!
- You sure do light up a room! And I'm not even trying. Cats are mysterious...
- Really mysterious...
- What are you up to? Even I don't know. BARK! Too lound.
- bark Too soft.
- Are you ever happy? Too whiny. COUGH! GASP!
- WHEEZE! HACK!
- Okay, come in! Enough with the fresh air. I need only two things, Liz.
- The love of a good woman...
- And a meticulous sock drawer. Do you know him? No. That was my pet mule.
- She had three legs, a glass eye, and one tooth.
- I miss you, Aphrodite! I must have the movie rights. Sigh...
- Every time I try to say something romantic to Liz, it comes out wrong.
- Mybe I just need to practice.
- You b eLiz, and I'll say something romantic to you.
- Let's see. How about this?...
- Your eyes are like deep pools of lumpy brown gravy.
- Wow, I'm better than I thought! You had me at ""gravy"". I'm in a bad mood.
- And there's only one thing to do when that happens.
- Pass it on. Uh-oh.
- Whoa! Apple pie!
- I must check behind my back more often! Jon's contemplating his life.
- The joys, the sorrows...
- I'll never play the bagpipes. The roads not taken... Sigh.
-
- I take it Garfield isn't coming. ""meow"". A penny for your thoughts, Jon.
- Are nose hairs connected to the brain?
- A dollar if you never ask it again. Thank you. Garfield, I was wondering...
- They say cats are clean animals...
- What happened to you? I'm a rebel. Siiigh
- Well, there's a blizzard outside... Don't say it.
- We're snowe din... Don't say it.
- The cable TV has gone out... Don't say it.
- And we're out of hot chocolate. Don't say it.
- What ELSE can go wrong?
- You said it. It's time to put an end to...
-
- It's time to start something. I found my toolbox, Garfield!
- A man without tools is no man at all!
- Now, how does this open? Turn in your man card. I have tools, Garfield!
- Men and tools built skyscrapers, you know...
- Like with this thingy. Put it back before you hurt somebody. Oh, that's just great!
- The mice are using the cat for a bed!
- Should I make little blankets?! There is a chill. Ignore him. Jon's dealing with the mouse problem in a very unique way.
- He's trying to adapt.
- Today is the worst day of my life. Say cheese. GULP!
- Poor thing, your dish is empty.
- Timing is everything.
- Let's make snow angels, Garfield!
- C'mon! It'll be fun!
- All you have to do is fall backward into the snow...
- And then flap your arms to make the angel wings!
- Watch me!
- Coming up next, a local man is gored by his own lawn gnome. Here's what you are, Garfield.
- ""Sedentary"".
- It means you collect dust. Use it in a sentence. Okay, everybody, break it up!
- Oh. It's just you, Garfield.
- I am NOT fat! WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- snatch!
- hee hee hee hee New driver's license photo. Sports have always been a big part of my life.
-
- Being bad at them, I mean. Ah. Garfield!
- That popcorn was for everyone.
- And ""everyone"" is my middle name, baby! I demand respect!
- I respect you, Garfield.
- I could have demanded a pizza! SMACK! click click click click
- CLICK Rats...there's nothing good in.
-
- Hi, Arlene. Hi, Garfield.
-
- Let's talk about US.
- CLICK Sorry, Garfield.
- I'm too depressed to cook.
- That doesn't help. What if I juggle mice? I should never have tried to make pizza from scratch!
- Me pizza. Me want more pepperoni.
- MWA-HA-HA! Too much yeast. BEWARE...
- OF THE CONDESCENDING DOG
- Okay, now I am about to bark at you. I hate him already. Why, hello, Garfield.
- My, my, how disappointing...
- I want the remote. No cheese, no remote. The forecast is cloudy and cold.
- Sigh...it might snow...who knows?...
- WHO CARES! It's been a long winter.
- MORE CLOTHES-PINS!!
- It's been a long winter. . Whoa! Look at THAT!
- What in the world IS that, Garfield?
- Hey, Liz! Cmere and LOOK at this!
- What? In the sky...what IS that thing?!
-
- It's the SUN, Jon. It's been a long winter. We need some entertainment, Garfield.
- Let's lip-synch the old opera records!
- We'll need viking helmets! May you sit upon one.
- Stop shedding!
- Like cats have pause buttons. I haven't seen you lately.
- I was asleep last month.
- The whole month? Well, I did toss and turn a little around the twenty-third. * Oh, a spider's life for meeee... *
- ** Catcha juicy fly... *
- * Catch that fly, and suck it dry... * Review time. We're a little tired this morning, Liz.
- All-night cartoon marathon.
- She thinks we're nuts. The woman's priorities are obviously out of whack. Whoa...
- What if you could see through your eyelids?
- We'll return to ""Deep, Dumb Thoughts"" after this message.
- It's getting to be that time of year, Garfield.
- We really should do our spring cleaning.
-
- lick lick
- eee-eee eee-eee eee-eee eee-eee
- There. We're BACHELORS, baby. I have swept and vacuumed up all the cat hair in the house.
-
- Ah, the cycle of life! Man, I look good today!
- Oh, wait...
- I forgot to take the hanger out of my shirt. You're going to leave it in there, aren't you? ODIE
-
- Are you losing weight?
-
- Spring is here. The sun is shining, Garfield.
- The air is fresh!
- Not an inside day, pal. Are you implying movement? Someday, I'll be a mighty tree!
- You're a flower. You bloom, and then you die.
- I should've stayed in school. Yep, I think it is...
- I think it's about this time, Garfield...
- Time for my annual dance to spring!
- UNNNGHH...UFFFFFFF...EERRRRRGHHHHH...
- HEEP! HOOP! HUP!
- GUUUUUHHHHH GUH! GUH! GUH!
- Well, nuts. Face it, the daisy days are gone. You know, Garfield...
- It would be shame if I were allergic to cat hair. Yeah.
- I'd have to get rid of you. I'm going to be a butterfly.
- And just how are you going to do that? Uh...
- I know a guy. Hey there, buddy!
- Have some pudding, ol' pal, ol' pal!
- There's a pill in there, isn't there? Things are looking up.
-
- That's just how awful things have been lately. Liz, why do you go out with me?
-
- Well, this is an awkward pause. I'm gathering my thoughts. Garfield, I had a profound thought.
-
- Gone. Lock that door, please.
- Odie, leave me alone! Go play with someone else!
-
- FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH FUH
- SQUEEK SQUEEK SQUEEK SQUEEEEK SQUEEEEK SQUEEK SQUEEK SQUEEEEK
- GLUG GLUG GLUG GLUG GLUG GLUG
- I like living here.
- We're laid-back.
- No one's going to steal my brain! And somewhat insane. BARK! BARK! BARK!
-
- Would you mind not listening to music while I'm barking at you? Huh? * Jon's whistling.
- La lan La * Now he's singing.
- Care to join me for a run? Now he's doing stand-up comedy. Mouse!
- Kill it an eat it, Garfield!
- Kill and eat! Sorry, I'm more of a thaw-and-microwave guy. What if Liz breaks up with me?
- I can't handle rejection.
- Ridicule and scorn, but not rejection. You also do loathing well. Welcome to ""Healthy Kids"".
- Now another episode of...
- ""Billy, the happy intestine""! Billy creeps me out. Hmmmmm...
- I'll have amedium popcorn, and a medium soda.
- For an extra dollar, you can get both of those large, with free refills.
- Wow! Really? ...I'll TAKE it!
- What a deal, huh?
- And for another dollar, you can have the bottomless nacho basket. SURE!
- So, how was the movie? Garfield, I feel lazy. Yes, come to the dark side.
- Maybe I need to exercise. No! No! Come back!
- Or eat cookies and watch TV. Yes, come to me, my son. The ancients believed cats were good luck.
-
- They died out. Who's feeding the cats?! Before you eat me...
- May I borrow a marker? Sure.
- Okay, I'm ready. Hmmm. I didn't see that coming. IT WAS THE CAT Here we go...
- MOMMY, LOOK! Wait for it...
- IT'S A HAIRY HOG! ...and, it's biting time. Walking in the rain is so romantic.
- Running through the sprinklers is fun, too.
- That's not as romantic. Yeah, but there's less chance of a lightning strike. Score one for the paranoid. Life is going on out there...
- And here I sit eating donuts and watching cartoons.
- Reality is overrated. **
- *
- This concludes our early movie, ""Of Mice and Men"".
- Thank you for watching.
- Now stay tuned for our late movie...
- ""The Fly"".
- Good morning! Bagel or toast?
- Either way, I'm gonna burn it!
- BWA-HA-HA-HAAAH! Technology hates me. I'm back, Garfield.
- You haven't moved, have you?
- Exactly what do you do when I'm gone? Oh, gee! You just missed the pony ride! Still sleeping with your teddy bear, I see.
- That's kind of immature, you know...
- Time to grow up. Thank you, Mr. Bunny Slippers. Spiderwebs are okay, but I'm thinking of getting my own apartment.
- SMACK!
- Or an envelope. My prom was traumatic.
- I had to wear dad's tuxedo.
- We couldn't find the pants. Nice kilt. I bought cat food, Garfield. Life is good.
- It's a special formula for ""lazy cats"". Cool.
- Pre-chewed. Life is VERY good.
- Well, is THAT so?!
- ...OH, YEAH?!
- HA!
- THAT'S WHAT *YOU* THINK!!
- Most people don't argue with their pets. Why, thank you!
- That wasn't a compliment, dimwit! SMACK!
- Roll over.
- I'm not doing this again. You want me to get flat on one side? You never respond to my barking.
- What if I lie down and play dead?
- Gee, I feel so dog-like! Wake me in an hour. Catch me, Jon!
-
- Didn't you used to be taller? Yup, years ago I offended an old gypsy woman.
- She put a curse on me.
- ""Take this cat,"" she said! I'm sensing negativity here. I'm bored, Garfield.
- Let's do something.
- Wanna go to the airport and pretend we're going somewhere? Like to a place with life? Whipped cream? Just when it can't get any better.
- PSSSS!
- Darn! It does.
- This is a great love story.
- Are there car chases?
- It's a love story.
- Do they go over cliffs?
- It's a LOVE story. Do the cars explode?
- YES! THE WHOLE WORLD EXPLODES! Cool! Turn it up! Am I too late for fun?
-
- Too early?! I am a mighty oak!
- You're a twig.
- I am a mighty twig! The Pet Channel presents...
- ""The Cat's Pajamas""!
- Here's Fluffy modeling a lovely ensemble. Oh, please. I never get nice things. Oh, Garfield...
- Surprise! It's an apple pie!
- I prefer surprises in pie form! Liz is coming over tonight.
- Maybe I should tidy up.
- Think she'll want a clean fork? Let's not get crazy, here... What do you think of these fangs, huh?
- They could be whiter.
- MMMM! And braking with your mouth closed is just humming. Z
- One sleeping dog... Z
- One can sneezing powder... Z
- Apply sneezing powder to finger... Z
- Apply finger to sleeping dog's nose, annnd... Z
- CHOO
- And that were dumb. I know what I want to do with the rest of my life.
-
- Yes, this is it. And no, I don't need an assistant. Today is going to be my lucky day!
- WHAP!
- Of course, it's early yet! Always the optimist... I might have a flaw or two.
- I'm perfect.
- Tell me more about your many weaknesses. I vacuumed today, Garfield...
- And I discovered something.
- The rug isn't green. So it's not evolving? Hi, sweetie.
- You're so sweet.
- It's Liz. I figured it was that or you were talking to a donut. I invited Sally to the prom.
- I don't think she wanted to go wit hme.
- She burned her gown on my front lawn. Subtle. Oh, come on!
- You really liked that movie? Yes, I did.
- You CAN'T be serious! Of COURSE I am!
- ...men!
- ...women!
- ...dogs!
- It says here that you should greet monday morning with a smile.
-
- Or not. How about a gut-wrenching scream of desperation? Good things come to those who wait.
-
- Of course there's something to be said for that instant gratification thing, too. Life is a mystery, Garfield.
- So many questions.
- Like, what day is this? You are so cosmic. Life is a reflecting pool, Garfield.
- Where one can see one's true self.
- I have cool hair. The water must be murky today. What's your favorite polka song, Liz? Uh...
- I don't think I have one.
- Too hard to choose, huh? Just nod your head and back away slowly. I'm writing my memoirs, Garfield.
- Chapter two...
- That's where I get kidnapped by aliens. I suspected as much...
- Sigh...
- I've got this long list of things to do, Garfield...
- And all I REALLY want to do is take a long nap on the couch.
- But how can I do that without feeling massive guilt?!
-
- Teache me your ways, o master. Come to the sloth side, young Arbuckle. I hate mornings.
- I hate cheerful morning people.
- And I hate the old rubber omelet gag. Jon's on the social network.
- Here's his list of friends.
- ""Bob"".
- Where have you been? Eating lasagna.
- Did you save me some? Hello, my name is Garfield. I don't believe we've met. Ah, my high school garuation.
- I remember when they called my name.
- ""Ron Arbuckle"". Thanks for sharing, Ron. I like having Liz around, Garfield.
- She's very thoughtful
- And she doesn't shred the curtains. Just wait. Here's a delicious burger that I'm leaving next to you.
- I hope you don't eat it!
- Why don't you just throw the tofu away?
- click
- I chewed my owner's slippers.
- I'm too cute for words.
- I steal cheese.
- I'm a fat, lazy pig.
- I posted a stupid picture of my cat. Monday...
- TONK GOOSH
- At least it's reliable. BURP!
- tick tick tick tick
- You don't have to text me EVERYTHING you do! I lent Odie a book.
-
- I gave Odie a book. We'll save you!
- That isn't necessary! I'm fine, thank you!
- Are you sure?! Never trust dogs with ladders. Garfield, what are you trying to tell me?
- Is there danger?
- Do NOT go to the beach! Tonight's horror movie...
- ""Claws of Death!""
- Oh, look, Howard, a little kitten! Run, Howard, run. Z
- Z
- MMMPH!
-
- MMMMPH!
- STOP IT!
- I'll stop it when your face stops being warm. You have a choice of alarms this morning.
- Do you prefer humorous or practical? Humorous.
- Did you hear the one about the cat and the lawn mower? I hate mornings. I need a new hobby. Bottle cap collecting wasn't exciting enough for you?
- Maybe I can take up bird watching! I can see the headline now...
- Or identify different types of wood! ""Local cat found bored to death near binoculars"". BEWARE OF THE DOG
-
- You saw the sign, right? This is how I beware.
- Garfield, where is my fish?
- By now? Somewhere between the esophagus and the duodenum. All we have is noodles, so we're having noodles tonight, Garfield.
- The forks are dirty, but we can use these pencils like chopsticks.
- And the napkins are still in the laundry, so... Will you please get married!
-
- I like it better when we have mice.
- Sigh...
- Hey, Odie, I'm stuck. Can you help me out?
-
-
-
- I'm in charge around here.
-
- Nobody else wanted the job. Moss always grows on the north side of a tree.
- Who cares?
- Which side does the taffy grow on? Odie isn't going outside today.
- The tough squirrels are out there.
- Las time, they forced him to gather acorns. Someday I'll get what I deserve.
- WAIT!
- I want something WAY better than that. Another age nightmare? Yep.
- You don't look very scary to me. Oh?
- I'm the menu you can't read without the glasses you can't find. I stand corrected. You?--
- You can't POSSIBLY be an age nightmare. Oh, but I am...
- I'm that awful music that kids today listen to! Go away.
- GUH!
- GAH! GAH! UNGGGGHHH
- GRUNT...GRUNT...EEEEERRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH
- HUP! HUP! HOOP!
-
- Getting out of bed gets harder every year, doesn't it? Blow it out your box spring. You're tonight's age nightmare? Yupper-do.
- But you're coffee. Coffe's not scary. Oh, no?
- I'm decaf, with nonfat milk and artificial sweetener. YAAHH ...so you're my age nightmare tonight? What are you?
- I'm fine print! BWAH-HA-HA-HAAAH!
- mmmfff! mmmffff! Let me guess...tonight's age nightmare? That's me!
- I'm the jar of pickles that you can't open any more!
- And you? I'm the package of batteries you never COULD open. I don't fel like getting older.
- Maybe if I change the year, I'll get younger on my birthday.
- Garfield, have you seen my pacifier? I'm in the mood for romance. I'm in the mood for pancakes!
-
- ROMANTIC pancakes! Good save, Romeo. Xou know what would be fun? Letting your cat sleep?
- We could lie on the front porch... And sleep?
- And pretend that we're doormats! That say ""beware of sleeping cat"". Z
- BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP click
-
- Here are your breakfast lawn gnomes, Garfield.
- And here's your breakfast guitar.
- I'm still asleep, aren't I? Ya think? I'm tired of the daily grind.
- Oh, me, too.
- You probably don't even know what that means. I'm tired of hearing about it. Another wildlife show.
- Always the sam ething. I get a craving for antilope. BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Hey! I'm not done yet!
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! You didn't have to go back to the beginning. We insects have six legs.
- You have eight legs. Technically, yes...
- If you count the spares. Today I put hats on my feet and a shoe on my head.
-
- On purpose? I told you she'd ask! ding ding ** Ice cream man!
-
- How?--
- Here's your wallet.
-
- Odie, I need for you to eat these left socks.
- Guys, make these pens disappear. Aye, aye, sir.
- Hold up, Squeak...this remote goes under the couch. Got it.
- You think you can get these keys on top of the fridge? Sure thing, boss.
- How can one person lose so much stuff?! My work here is done. There's a whole world out there, Garfield...
- Just waiting to be experienced.
- But that would require going outside. Always a catch! I helped an elderly lady across the street today.
- I looked both ways before crossing, but I didn't look down...
- There was this open manhole... Stop right there! dig dig dig dig
- mmmmm
- YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! It's war.
- M
- I didn't have the energy for a whole ""meow"". We had a great time at the amusement park.
- The hot dogs...the popcorn...
- ...the roller coasters...
-
- I knew that cupcake would come unstuck from the ceiling eventually. click
- Welcome to ""Adorable Animals."" Here's a puppy who just can't stay awake!
- And two kittens who snuggle together in a sunbeam...
- As squirrels and bunnies frolic together in the garden outside!
- That's it for this week's ""Adorable Animals"".
- Coming up next...
- ""Hideous, Disgusting Animals"" Well, it's monday, and you know what that means...

- Zoom
- Seemed appropriate. I have a sore throat.
- So... BARK
- And... NOT SCARED Liz and I are going to the museum.
- And cats aren't allowed.
- That was our idea. Garfield! It's good to be back home!
- Wait a minute!
- I never went anywhere! Cue the scary music. You want to play?
- Fetch the ball, Odie!
- That's not the ball I threw. plop
- That's not it, either.
- That's not even close.
- Even I've forgotten what he was supposed to fetch.
-
- What will it take to make you go away? Food has historically proven to be an effective motivator. I'm a pretty hip dude.
-
- So... Wait, I'm still processing that last comment. I'm going hang gliding!
-
- The house is mine! I'm starting to suspect that this isn't my hat.
- I wouldn't jump to conclusions, Jon.
- Maybe that's not your head. Barkbarkbarkbarkbarkbark
- That's it. Gotta go!
- And the weekend begins. My, this is interesting.
- There was a fish in this bowl...
- And now there isn't. He said something about getting a condo.
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- THUD
-
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- THUD
- -Guys, give the poor dog a break.
- BLAT
- Coffee wore off, eh? Who told? My new girlfriend is from another country.
- Another country?
- She lives in the basement. Does she speak English? Someday we may be visited by creatures from another planet.
-
- I hid the cookie jar. Mmm
- Whole wheat! Mmm
- Whole bacon! What have you been up to, Jon?
- I've been dating you.
- I already knew that. That's all he got, lady. We're out of ketchup...
- So I put whipped cream on your sandwich.
- He knows me well. C'mon, boys, let's go for a walk.
- It's a gloomy day, but at least it isn't raining.
- Well, at least it isn't snowing.
- Well, at least it isn't hailing.
- tok tok tok tokWell, at least there isn't lightning. tok tok
- CRACK! How about stopping there, jinx-boy! I'm glad I didn't mention a volcano. FOOM Garfield, I just had a profound thought!...
-
- Darn! May it rest in peace. Welcome to ""Practical Jokes""!
- Ted has put a squirrel in his wife Cindy's purse. Let's watch...
- Uh, Cindy, do you have any gum? And the number of a good divorce lawyer? Arf Arf
-
- Arf Arf Private conversation. Cats can sense when something is wrong.
- SMACK! Ow!
- That hurt! I knew that... Liz and I rode a roller coaster today. It went way up in the air...
- And then went way down.
- Am I blinking? Not yet. Hard-core sports fans are crazy.
- But hard-core game show fans are even crazier. AARDVARK! AARDVARK! AARDVARK! And the answer is ""Platypus"".
- I wonder what the water temperature is?
- Could be ice-cold, you know. Could be.
- I guess there's only one way to find out. Yeah.
- Man, I hate to do this. No prob.
- I'll do it.
- Well? How is it? DO SOMETHING WITH THE MICE, GARFIELD! OKay.
-
- Having dinner is not what I meant! Well, then, I guess that we should have been a little more specific, shouldn't we? I heard of a cure for stress.
- Relaxing your facial muscles.
- Ah, that's better. For you, maybe. Why do dogs bury bones?...
- dig dig dig Nobody knows.
- Hang on... I think it's flea season.
- I feel itchy.
- And I see tiny ladders. Have you ever put your shoes on before your socks? No.

- Oh, me neither! Uh-huh. Help Wanted

- No, I don't need any wings with that. No, I don't want any breadsticks, either, Just the pizza.
- AND JUST WHY WOULD I NEED A SERVICE PLAN FOR A PIZZA?! The old upsell. I'm ordering a pizza. What should I get?
- Yes, could I get a large...mushroom pizza...
- With frogs...and make it sad? So much for chicken and onion. Happy slap-in-the-back-of-the-head day!
- SLAP!
- NOT one of Jon's favorite holidays. Liz put me on a healthy diet.
- She thinks I'm sticking to it, but I'm not.
- I feel so guilty. Donuts help. I'm going to spend the say seeing the world like you! Welcome.
- There's not much to do down here, is there? Now you're getting it...
- Z And now you've got it. **

- Garfield
- Mittens
- Pumpkin
- Ah, your obedience school yearbook...
- I remember Mittens. Yeah, there's a weirdo in every class. Sometimes, when I watch the news, I think that humanity might be in trouble.
- But then I look out the window on a bright, sunny day...
- Adn I KNOW it's in trouble.
- Food.
- Thanks for pointing that out. Once upon a time there was a house with a man, a dog, and a cat.
- The man was thin, the dog was happy, and the cat was fat.
- Then the cat ate my breakfast, and the dog chewed up my slippers this morning! This sounds familiar. Do not be jealous of my awesomeness.
-
- Oh, okay, go ahead! Liz cares about me.
- She put me on a healthy diet.
- Now I'm going to care about you. Vent your hsotility elsewhere, Slim.
-
- If you want me to move, just say so.
- Mmmmm...a nice nap outside, why don't I do this more often?
- FOO!

- Z Z Are you going to lie there all day? That's the plan.
- You won't get anything done like that. Also part of the plan.
- You're going to disintegrate into a big pile of dust and just blown away! Someone's leaked the plan! And now, to explain the meaning of life, here's Odie.
- Z
- I've never felt closer to you. What a great night, huh, Garfield?
- My aunt Walburga used to say the stars were tiny fairies who watch over us and bring us good luck.
- Then she stepped right off the edge of the canyon. I'm going home now. Liverwurst...horseradish...and anchovy paste! Voila! The perfect sandwich!
-
- How come you're not answering your phone? Where can we go on vacation this year, Garfield?
- Aside from a lasagna factory.
- That's a stumper. YAH!
- This puddle was deeper than it looked!
- Like he needed to point that out. A little help... 1983

- He wants me to eat the last cookie. Beware Of Shy Dog
-
- You can come out now. I can still hear you. Now, order the pizza.
- I'd like a large pepperoni with extra cheese, please.
- Next, we sit on the couch, pop jelly beans, and wait.
- My favorite cooking show.
-
- Boy, it's dark outside! That's the closet. I'm bored.
- Let's go someplace where we can meet some GIRL sock puppets!
- I'll do all the talking. I'll try not to put a crimp in your style.
- Hmmm.
- Must be lunchtime. Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!
- Thubk! GAH!

- I will go somewhere fun.
- Because you will not be there. BEWARE OF DOG
- And I need to beware of you because... Because I have the sniffles!
- Ah-choo! I guess a guy's gotta make a living. Severe weather is in the area.
- ** DING-DONG!
- Don't answer that! Donuts are bad for you, you know.
-
- They aren't as bad for me as I am for them.
-
- I've had worse.
- Hi, my name's Finn! What's your name?
-
- I just moved in today! Is this a nice place? Do you like it here?
-
- It looks like we're going to be roomies! I hope you don't snore, or like loud music...
- He just might be too stupid to eat. You don't talk much, do you? It's strange, Garfield.
- Every time I go into the pet store...
- The goldfishes scream.
- Did you pick a big, juicy one? See this fish, Garfield?
- This is the last fish I'm buying.
- Understand what I'm saying? I should savor it? Uh-oh! I'm going to make a run for it!
-
- There seems to be a teensy flaw in that plan. Just as a thought!
- The life span of a goldfish is seven years.
- Not two minutes! It was a rich and full life. I remember a happy fishbowl.
- I remember a frisky little fish
- Where have all the memories gone? Is this a country song? Hey, Garfield, remember aunt Frieda's egg salad from last Christmas?
- And the apple cobbler from your birthday, next to the summer salad?
- Oh, and there's a piece of mom and dad's wedding cake! Time to clean out the fridge.
- GARFIELD
- How cute...Garfield is posting photos of his dinners.
- GARFIELD
- GARF
-
- Saaay, that looks like mine. Burp YAWN!
- Can you try to be a little more personable? Yes, I can.
- If you can be a little less dull. How was your food? Forgettable.
-
- Mind refreshing my memory? BEWARE OF THE HIDDEN DOG
- You don't look very well-hidden. I'm not.
- I'm also not the one to beware of. Garfield, I want to watch TV.
- Let go of the remote.
- You can do this. Could we have a moment alone first? Someday I'd like to visit the moon.
-
- But you don't have to pack my things just yet! Garfield acts much nicer when you're here, Liz.
-
- Really? Are you leaving soon?
-
-
-
-
-
- I LOVE your work! Garfield, these are the good old days.
-
- I'm going back to bed. Already there. Run for your lives!
-
- And bring me back a meatball sandwich! FREE PUPPIES
-
- Still overpriced. Jon went to the dentist.
- I can always tell.
- There's a subtle change in his dining habits. If you could live in another time, when would it be, Garfield?
- Hmmm
- I'd have to go with this morning, when we had donuts. Z
-
- MMMPH! And happy dreams to you, too, Jon. **
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin.
- Authorities are reporting what appears to be a freak gardening accident.
- We have a reporter at the scene now..Stu, what can you tell us?
- Well, Laryy, it seems that a local man has his head stuck inside a watering can, and is walking down the middle of the street.
- I'll see if I can gat a word from him...sir? Channel Seven News here... Channel Seven?! I'm on TV?!
- Hi, Liz! We should do something. I've already locked the door. I'm very sure of myself.
- Sort of.
- Kind of...maybe...unless somebody's against it. Just stop talking. Don't hit me. Or kick me. Or scratch me.
- No problem.
- Or bite me. OH, COME ON! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
- Lies! All lies!
- Except for the fifth ""Yip"". claw claw claw Stop clawing the couch, Garfield!
- claw claw claw Stop clawing the curtains, Garfield!
- claw claw claw I DIN'T MEAN GO BACK TO THE COUCH!!! My lips are chapped!
- Now I can't kiss Liz!
- Great news!
- Garfield, there's an old saying...
- ""A lazy cat gathers no donuts"". That's why you are here to serve me.
- I wish I could just lie there doing nothing like you, Garfield.
- Look at me...I'm a lazy cat!
- I don't move for hours at a time...
- Staring off into space...
- Totally useless. -Well, I guess I'll go eat my lunch. That's what you (burp) think. A ghost!
- I'm not a ghost, I'm a talking sheet.
- And your little friend? Oh, he's a talking pillow-case. Hi! Channel changer, do your thing. The monster! It's alive!
- Yawn!
- Got any of those cheese crackers?
- Sounds like something I wrote. When the moon is full, I turn into a wolf!
- Then I can scratch the back of my head with my foot.
- Ooooo! That feels good! scritch scritch scritch THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SCARY MOVIE, YOU KNOW! Welcome to ""Cat Channel Cinema"".
- Tonight's film, ""The Day The Can Opener Died"".
- How was the movie last night? It was a weeper. Garfield, there's a creepy noise in my closet!
- Maybe it's a monster! Not to worry.
- What should we do? Your wardrobe will kill it.
-
- When did we get new curtains?
-
-
-
-
-
- What was THAT all about? Cute people walked by. Time to get up! So?
- ""Time to get up""...that really frosts me! Like I have a job! I'm a cat! Why would I have to...

-
- And... There's MORE?! Wow, Garfield, have you lost weight?
- You look like you've packed on a few pounds there.
- Awww...back already? I like liars. What do you think of my outfit?
-
- Well? Hang on. I'm working up a hairball.

- I'm trying to save energy! So am I! ""Dear ask a dog""...
- Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
- That wasn't the question.
- ZOO Do Not Feed The Animals
- No point going in there. HI, LIZ! HELLO! GREETINGS! HOLA! HOWDY-DOO! ALOHA! WHAT'S SHAKIN'? HOW'S IT GOIN'?!

- Salad can't be trusted.
- Phone, find local fitness centers. Just a moment.
- I have located three. What would you like to do?
- I'd like to join one. YOU?!
- YES, me! I'm VERY health conscious! Oh, really?
- You have twenty-seven pizza parlors on speed dial.
- My smartphone is smarter than I am. How tough is that? THE CAT IS A FINK
- I want whoever did this CAUGHT!
- Right away, sire. Pest control? There's a rat in my basement.
- Yes, you're absolutely right.
- I SHOULD get a cat. Cats shed. Maybe the rat in the basement will just leave.
-
- It's hanging pictures. Okay, rat, I'm coming down.!
- CLICK
- I hate it when they turn the lights on and set out a welcome mat. The rat in the basement is leaving.
- Yes! I knew I could get rid of him!
- He says he can't stand a whiny cat. You work with what you got. It's hard to keep up with all the changes in the world. I hear you.
- You should do what I do...
- Pretend they never happened.
-
- Look, Garfield! A falling star!
- If you make a wish on a falling start, it will come true.
- Did you make a wish?
- FLOMP
- Yes. I'm awake!
-
- And they say it couldn't be done! Hello? ...no, there's no Peggy here.
- No, ther enever was a Peggy here.
- No, I will NOT pretend to be Peggy! I love wrong numbers.
- Well, nothing's moving.
- I have high standards when it comes to cat food. I'm making grandma's special soup, Garfield.
- I'm trying to follow her recipe.
- Where do I get a coyote? We can substitute witch chocolate cake. Die time, Garfield.
-
- And just as I reach my target weight! Cat treats are a greater invention than the wheel.
- WHOA!...
- A wheel made from cat treats!

- SNORK!
- CHOO! SPLAT!

- YAAAAAHH WHAP WHAP WHAP WHAP WHAP WHAP WHAP This happens all the time. Sometimes winter can seem gray, dull, lifeless, cold and unforgiving.
- But then along comes Christmas.
- And along comes Jon. A little help... So this is your shopping list?
- No.
- That's the index. What would you like for Christmas, Odie? A chewy bone, or a squeaky bone?
-
- Odie? I think he locked up. Santa will be soon here.
- With presents for everybody who's been good.
- And me! And you. What's this? I'm sending Santa a picture of me.
-
- Not a very good likeness. Okay, I added the halo. Nothing lasts forever.
- Wrong!
- Fruitcake doesn't count! To: Santa From: Me
- Dear Santa, I have been good all year. Please see attached photos.

-
- This is fraud, you know... Shut up and smile. Santa Claus knows whether you've been good or bad.
- He's a fat guy who does nothing 364 days out of the year.
- You haven't been very good. Who is HE to judge ME?! I've heard that Christmas calories ""don't count"".
- I say that should also apply to the days of the week.
- How can you eat so much? Tuesday calories don't count. Look, Garfield, a banana slicer! Think Liz would like that for Christmas?
-
- Why do you look at me like that? Would you rather I rolled my eyes? Garfield, how about this for Liz? ...
- A wrinkle cream holiday gift set!
- You're going to be a lonely, lonely old man. Sigh...I never know what to get Liz for Christmas, Garfield.
- Look, you be her, and I'll try some gift ideas out on you. Fine.
- Teeth whitening strips! I think we should see other people. Ho! Ho! Ho! I bet Spider Calus knows what YOU want for Christmas!

- Caroling. We now return to ""Dick, the Cat Who Didn't Save Christmas""
- Dick, stop clawing the waterbed!
- Oh, no! The presents are all soaked! All right, Dick! Now go swat the ornaments off the tree! Liz, I just don't know what to get you for Christmas!
- Oh, Jon, YOU'RE all I need for Christmas.
- Maybe she could exchange you for something good. The holidays are a time for peace and love...
- So how's about a hug, tubbo?
- How's that hugging thing workin' for you, Larry? Blow it out your jingle bell, Carl. Let's see now...

- WHUMP! Ah. Presents...cookies...eggnogg...
- Is there anything about Christmas I DON'T like?
- smooooooooooooch It's Christmas!
- The one day of the whole year...
- when shredding is not frowned upon. Garfield I ate so much I can't move. Me too.
-
- Best Christmas ever. Ever. Hi! I'm your holiday overeating nightmare!
- MUAH-HA! HA! HA! HAAAAAH!
- But what ARE you? The last belt notch.
- What do you want to do for new year's eve, Liz? How about dinner and dancing?
- I think I'd be happy just ordering pizza and staying home with you, Garfield and Odie.
- Are you sure? Because I could get a pet sitter, and
- WHOP!
-
- Was I saying something? Yeah, but it wasn't important. I got my wife a treadmill for Christmas.
- That's nice.
- Why are you standing out here in the snow? I got my wife a treadmill for Christmas. 2009 has sure been a long year.
-
- We gotta get a new calendar. Mine is to not be so clumsy.
-
- THUD Resolutions are SO hard to keep. My resolution is to be more sensitive to the feelings of others.
- SMACK
- That HURT! I feel your pain. This year I resolve to abandon my scavenging, vermin ways.
-
- Are you gonna finish that? My new year's resolution is to lose weight.
- You? Lose WEIGHT?! Yeah...
- I'm gettin' a real fly gut. glug glug glug

- Me!
- Love! The world loving ME! You never know what might be around the next corner.
-
- You go ahead, I'll wait here. Do you believe in time travel?
- Observer...
- When I get up, it will be friday. I dreamed about you last night, Liz. How sweet.
- I also dreamed about Godzilla. Different dream, I hope.
- Then let's say it was. I'll be leaving the room now. First snowflake of the year. I wonder what kind of season it'll be.
- BLOOEY!
- Probably a bad one.
- UNGH!
- FLUMP
- ARRRGH!

- ...and then I fell asleep.
- Have you noticed how all my stories end that way?
- Z I'm the best!
- You're the worst.
- My turn. I'm the best! It's snowing! Let's make a snowman!
- But the snow's too powdery to roll into a ball.
- My father is a bowling ball. Really?
- Uh-huh.
- He thinks I'm soft. Ba-da-CHING! I can't find my pants.
- Where could they be?
- They're probably hiding.
- Oh, you've got it tough.
- I COULD use a pillow.
- Jon!
- There you are!
- Right there.
- Instead of someplace else.
- Like over there.
- Man! It's hard to create excitement around here!
-
- Good times. Booyah. Wanna chase me?
- No?
- Wouldn't do it. Sure! Make the cat do all the work! Just look at that... BEWARE OF LOG
- How sad is it when somebody can't even spell a simple word like
- I was very involved in athletics, Garfield.
- I was a student manager...
- Of the chess team. He wiped their brows. munch munch munch

- Hmm...but there's not much snow...
- My uncle Roscoe was very wise.
- He'd say, ""You have to accept people, warts and all"".
- He had this gigantic. Stop right there! Cat Mania!

- This express line is a time-saver. You know, Jon, Garfield is almost like your child.
- Feed me, daddy!
- I wish you wouldn't give him ideas. Wah! For my first trick...
- I will do the impossible.
- This cat will fetch this ball. That's a puppet! I'm depressed.
-
- ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME WORSE?! Oh, great...
- Just great...I've been sitting here so long, I'm frozen to the fence.
- Garfield, what are you doing out here? I'm frozen to the fence.
- You shouldn't be sitting outside in the cold like this. I'm frozen to the fence.
- Why don't you come inside? I'm making cocoa. I'm frozen to the...
- Cocoa?
- Sometimes dreams do come true.
-
- You dream about stumbling aimlessly through a meaningless existence? Sometimes a man has to make tough decisions.
-
- I wonder what that's like. To be a man?
- Your staring at me doesn't bother me.
- How about now? Okay, that's a little creepy. Odie has no idea what's going on.
- What IS going on? What pretty snow...it looks like powdered sugar falling on french toast.
-
- Don't wait up. I think I'll go powder my nose.
- You're not going to leave, are you? Why would I do that?
- My date's coming back. More water, Romeo?
-
-
-
-
- YAAAH! This really needs to stop. You're stifling my creativity! You look bored.
- I'm not bored...
- I have an image to maintain. How's it goin' tonight, folks? Feelin' good?
- Oh, things could be going better. I have this pain in my neck. So do I! No kidding? Yeah, curled up under the sofa all night. I hear you, girl. What do you do for that? Oh, I just...
- That was a rhetorical question! Good stuff! Yeah, I like it! Ask us another one! YAWN!
- YAWN!
- Nothing to do? Did it. I strained a muscle today.
- Wow!
- You have a muscle? I think I'll do something rugged and manly. Like what?
- Mow the lawn with my shirt off!
- I'm stuck! Now's your chance to make a run for it. I wonder if it's possible for you to be even lazier.
- I could be...
- But you'd have to do it for me. MEOW
- MEOW
- Robots will never replace cats.
- They could never do the things we do.

- The technology is more advanced than I thought! Z Kids...

- Whoa!
- There's an awful lot not going on. I like to think of myself as smart.
- Good for you.
- I like to think of myself as skinny. Let's do something exciting!
- We could try to give Garfield a bath!

- YAWN!
- Why must you outdo me at everything? Because I can. I could climb this tree.
- But then I'd just fall out of it.
- Might as well just skip to the end. Go away, Odie. You bother me.
-
- I guess I asked for that... Mom, I have to go now.
- I really do have to go...
- Oh, all right. I'll talk to the cow. Jon, you know how the cow drones on... What would I do if Liz ever dumped me?
- Hmmm...
- You look like a crier. What could be better than being a cat?
-
- Being a cat with ice cream!
- I'm gonna cook dinner for Liz tonight! Is this your way of breaking up with her?
- Baking powder...that's basically baking soda, right? Go for it.
- Huh...the butter is crispy. Is that normal? In a comic strip, yes.
- I wonder if I should've added the eggs before I put it in the oven. Does the oven have an ""undo"" button?
- Okay, where's the fire extinguisher? Right where you left it the last time you cooked.
- I am so, so sorry. Jon's smart enough to feel disappointed in himself, but too dense to do anything right. Good night, Garfield. Good night, Jon.
- I'll attempt to, but fail to, wake you in the morning. And I'll attempt to, and succeed at, sleeping in.

- Aren't you going to ask me about my day?
- So, how was your day, as if I care? Try again. How about ""sorry""?
- Or ""oops""?
- I'm trying to think of words for Jon to live by. Sigh...
- Sigh... What's wrong, Jon?
- I was going to do my annual dance to spring...
- But I can't find my daisy costume ANYwhere!
- Oh, well...
- Did you bury it deep? Way deep.
- Time for plan B! Well, go dig it back up. On my way! Life is good, Garfield.
- There's nothing I want.
- And you got it. Welcome to ""Stupid Mime Theater""

- Whoa! That was PERFECT!
- When it comes to barking, it's QUANTITY, not quality, you know!

- Do you not see that mouse?! Do you not know that it's impolite to point?! The health department came today.
- We can only serve water.
- But not in our glasses. Not a straw long enough... I'm back! You may proceed to tell me how much you missed me!

- Uh-oh, my hearing has failed!

- What happened?! March suckered me again. The vacuum cleaner has worn out.

- I win! Check out the new phone, Garfield.
- It texts...it e-mails...
- Press this and two little arms come out and juggle. NOW I'm impressed. You think you're so smart!
- Not really...
- I'm smart AND good-looking. I'm in a bad mood today!
- Somebody's got to pay!
- KNIT ME INTO AN ITCHY SWEATER! Whoa! Calm down, pal! BURP!
- Good one!
- You aren't big on charm, are you? Nope. Now how about that awesome belch? Garfield, sometimes I wish I could understand what you're thinking.

- Hey, everyone, Skinny's here!
- Yep, everyone loves Skinny. That is the most pathetic attempt at revers psychology tha tI have ever heard. Enjoying your berries, Garfield?
- Oh, no...
- It's called a ""diet"". I AM awake! To diet, you have to learn to say ""no, thank you."" That's easy enough.
- Okay, a test...care for some ice cream?
- No, thank you.

- Okay, today I gotta give you one, Arbuckle. You know, Garfield, I often wonder if I could have been a doctor.

- Or RIGHT NOW?! Jon has attention issues. ""Dear Ask A Dog, do you think a dog will ever walk on mars?""
- Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!

- Aha!
- Here comes the pizza guy now! I don't climb trees until they are tall enough.
-
- Are you getting shorter? Uh...maybe. Oh, Garfield...
- Garfield, do you have any idea what happened to the last slice of leftover pizza?

- Unless, of course, you think I'm really great. Garfield, you've got a lot to learn about being nice.
- I know.

- Z Z I regret nothing!
-
- I wish I hadn't said that. ba-da * ching! I'm cutting down on cookies.

- I think I'll go spend some time with Jon.

- Yeah, I met him.
- I found him to be an affable fellow, albeit chewy.
- Meow. Meow.
- Meow. Meow.
- Meow. Meow.
- MEOW! MEOW!

- Ant just what are we arguing about? I haven't the foggiest idea.
- What's going on? Nothing.

- THIS IS NOT A TRICK. REALLY!
- The coyotes in this neighborhood aren't very clever. ...and I lived happily ever after!
- The End
- The best books are the ones you write yourself. SMOOOOCH!

- Though not without some effort. Storms were dangerous on the farm.
- They spook the herd.
- Ever been in a chicken stampede? I'm going to have nightmares.
- BONK!
- Apple? No, thanks. They give me a headache. Fun follows me wherever I go.
- Hurry up! Let's discuss our feelings. I'm hungry.
- Try again. I'm sleepy.
- Try again. Choose one, lady, I only have two feelings. Today's subject... ""Cats: Why are they such losers?""
- Let's ask the experts...
- Arf! Oh, THAT panel isn't very biased. click
- ...do you own a cat? Yes.
- ...does it have zero respect for you? Does it consider you its personal slave? Yes...yes...
- ...does it take you for granted? Does it walk all over you? Does it treat you like dirt? Yes! Yes! Yes!
- ...and do you love your cat?
-
- YES! Go make me a sandwich. I should slow doen and take it easy.
-
- Maybe later. YAWN!
- Uh-oh...my jaw locked!
- Guess what happened to me! How should I know?! You're shedding cat hair on the lawn.
- Some call it cat hair.
- I call it mulch. People are superior to cats. Okay, and why is that?
- Because...uh, because... Yes?
- Because WE are taller than you. WE are as tall as we want to be. ...and that's how I spent my day.
- How did you spend YOUR day? Listening to YOU talk about YOUR day.
- I knew that I was going to regret it the second I said it. I am the king of cats.

- I declare today a holiday!
- Z
- Check me out!
- Thought I'd give the world a thrill. If only I could travel back through time.
- I wouldn't be stuck here...
- Without a snack. Watermelon slices make tasty treats.
- And the rinds make lovely hats.
- And gluing the seeds to your eyebrows tells people that you are a fun personage! Craft people are strange. glug glug glug
- Someone's been in the refrigerator.
- Are you drinking ketchup? Shouldn't you be shopping? Halt! Who goes there?!
- HALT, I SAY!

- Sigh
- I love fall...
- It's so peaceful. News flash! Space aliens have landed!
- They have taken over the earth!
- And they really don't like cats. I hate mondays. Count Dracula? I thought you were dead!
- I was, but I'm feeling much better now...
- Now that I'm taking these new chewable vitamins! Product endordement. The monster uses his incredible strength!
- RRRRR!
- But he still can't get that jar open. Monsters love pickles. I've DONE IT, Igor! Done what, Master?!
- I've transplanted the brain of a cat into an elephant!
- Do you realize what this means?! You're gonna need a bigger litter box. Trevor? Yes, babs?
- We need to talk. YAAHH!
- ...about US. YAH! YAH! YAAAAHHH!! Bachelor horror theater. I am a ghost cat!

- Are knees supposed to bend this way?
- ...or three. BURP!

- This is going on your evaluation!
-
- I am a cat of great dignity.
- BURP
- And soda. Liz is great. Yes, she is.
- And she likes me. Yes, she does.
- So, why? I can't explain it either. I believe that things happen for a reason.
- I put mustard on my ice cream!
- Even if it's a really stupid reason.
- Wow.
- It hasn't been this dull around here in a long time.
- Remember how it used to be?
- It was dull around here 24/7.
- We'd sit around for so long our legs would go numb!
- Only Jon could get nostalgic about boredon. And you, crawling after the ice cream truck, going, ""WAIT! WAIT!"" Cheer up, Garfield. Try thinking happy thoughts. Okay.
- Slave dogs bearing deep-fried everything...
- Jon is a genius! Meow
- What's that? You say you're NOT hungry?
- Nope. That wasn't it. No.
- A thousand times no.
- It is not wise to loan a newspaper to a dog.
- BURP!
- Was that thunder?! Pepperoni. I'm willing to shar emy feelings. I'm willing to share my popcorn.
- Already ate it.
- Great! Now I have to share my feelings! Not with me, pal.

- Here, turkey, turkey, turkey...
- Heeere, turkey, turkey, turkey.
- Where IS that turkey?
- HEEEEERE, turkey, turkey, turkey.

- I owe you big time. Just have the suit dry-cleaned. Garfield, getting you up is like eating soup with a fork.
- Like eating peas with a knife.
- You're up... I can't sleep through food analogies. I demand respect!
- Have a burger.
- Close enough. Okay, Garfield...fetch!
- CLONK
- You have no interest in fetching a stick, do you? Stick, no. Pizza, yes. See food.
- Eat food.
- Life really isn't that complicated. What would hapen...
- If I tried to be a failure...
- And failed? We'd be rich! In quiet moments my mind goes to another place.

- How long do I have to wear these?
- For 26 episodes, or until I stop thinking it's funny. STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!
- Run, everyone!
- Rats... Bigfoot can never sneak up on anybody. I like a guy with a sense of humor.
-
- Know anybody like that? No. I'm behaving myself today.

- SCHWACK
- Okay, now I'd call that ""bad"".
- Sigh What's wrong, Jon?
- I just never know what to get you for christmas, Liz.
- Oh, Jon, it's sweet of you to worry, but I'm sure I'll love ANYTHING you get me.
- Really? Really.

-
- And now it's behind me. I didn't go shopping, Garfield.
- We're having leftovers tonight.
- What year do you prefer? I'm rather fond of 1978. Jon's looking at his photo album.
- Farm memories...
- The livestock section. I just found a box with some of my old toys!

- sniff Excuse me. Thanks for sharing, Garfield. Garfield, let's go outside and play fetch.
-
- I'll get the ball. I thought you were kidding!
-
- Ask me what I did today. Let me guess... You're going to use that pathetic puppy face to beg for food?
-
- How's this? Is this right? The world is a horrible place!
- Dinner.
- Well, it WAS! Liz, life is like a giant pan of lasagna...
- And Garfield got to the table before we did.
- What are you saying, Jon? We'll have to eat out. Burp! We house cats seem to be nice, but we still have all our primal insticts intact.
- Yes, the savage blood of our jungle forefathers yet courses through our veins as we venture off to the hunt.
- Oh, taxi!
-
-
- *
- *****************
- ?
- * I think I'll get up.
-
- I THINK a lot of things. ACHOO!
- BRAAAAP!
- I hate it when you're sick! Oh, I'm sorry, is this your sweater? ""Dear ask a dog.""
- ""Why are you guys always smelling stuff?""
- Just answer the question! sniff sniff Let's do something.
- Again?!
- We did something LAST week! Liz says I have too much cologne on. What do you think?
- THUD
- Guess so. Hey! My felas are gone! Jon says wormth escapes through your head.
-
- If ever there was an argument for frostbite...
- It's snowing!
- It's SNOWING!!
- IT'S SNOWING!!
- IT'S...
-
- cold. Have you missed me, world?
-
- I didn't miss YOU, either. It's been nice visiting with you.
- Guess I'll go home to the wife and eggs.
- A little bird humor there. Very little.
- ZIP
- Being friendly is Odie's worst trait. Some say I'm lazy...
- But I digest food while I'm asleep.
- And just what are you doing? Multitasking, baby! Do you think I'm good enough for Liz?
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- You're the wrong guy to ask. Oh, I think I laugh for everyone. I love you, Richard!
- Who's ""Richard""?
- I mean ""Russell"". Just don't forget to feed the cat, lady. Hmmmmm...
- Oh, look, Garfield! Our trip to the beach!
-
-
-
-
- That was SO much fun...we should go again! Time for bed.
-
- Look at me...I forgot to get up today! There's never a dull moment around here.
- Hey, Garfield, wanna watchm e sort socks?
- ...a dull LIFETIME, yes. Guess who?
- Hi, Garfield.
- How'd you know? Who else would have paws that smell like peanut butter? Lunch has officially ended as of...
- Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp
- Now. You're disgusting. Guess what Garfield and I did yesterday. Stared off into space?
-
- Well, not the WHOLE day. We took nap breaks. I would like to climb a mountain, or swim an ocean.
- BAT
- Even better! RIIINNNG * Hello?
- Skiing?...really?! SURE, Liz! I haven't been skiing in AGES!
- See you later, Garfield! SLAM!
- i:00 PM
- 3:00 PM
- 6:00 PM click
- Tonight's top story: ""Mayhem on the bunny slope""! I should get up.
-
- It takes a big cat to admit when he's made a mistake. I'm in a great mood!
- That's annoying.
- And it just keeps getting better! ""Dear ask a dog""...
- ""Grrrrrr!""
- Please, no hate mail.
- Somebody put this green thing on my sandwich.
- This is lettuce. Name it, take it to a movie, keep it as a pet, but I'm not eating it! We're going for a run.
- Cool.
- I'm going for a just-lie-here. A double cheeseburger with a baked potato...
- Instead of french fries.
- Oh, how I suffer.
-
-
-
- SCHLUCK
- Ahhhhhhhhh
- Cocoa always tastes better after you've built a snowman.
- Cheeseburger.
- And THAT'S how you do a sit-up. I don not believe this morning is going to end well for you, Jon. That cloud looks like a meat loaf...
- And that one looks like an appl pie.
- What's the weather like? Delicious. Mmmmm.
- Cheese with cheese on it.
- Mice are so uncomplicated. You never take me anywhere but this fence.
- I think of this as ""our place"".
- How sweet! I'm also cheap. * smoooch
- Mmm. Goodnight kisses are wonderful! . Don't make me slap you... **ROWR!
-
- More complaints from the neighbors. I can't get any louder!
- I'm writing a love letter, guys. Listen... ""Love is like an ostrich""... No, make that ""A pipe wrench""... No, how about this...
- ""I would walk to the ends of the earth for you...or at least Ohio"".
- That's not right, either! What can I say to Liz to tell her how much I love her?! RIP! RIP! RIP! How about ""I love you""? I love you?
- I love you. I love you.
- SMOOOOCH * I've seen it all.
-
- If it's on the ceiling.
-
- Anything interesting outside? Not since I came in.
-
- And you think I'VE gained weight! I'm cold.
- Jon?!
- Would you turn the winter down, please? I could never be a superhero because I don't look good in tights.
- THAT'S the reason?
- Are you saying I DO look good in tights? Please don't encourage him! I'm always looking for ways to improve my brain.
- Hmmm...
- Have you considered a fresh coat of paint?
-
-
-
-
- 1000 DINGLE BALLS
- Nightmare? No more jalapeno poppers before bed. Nothing can stop me!
-
- Or start me. Stay tuned for more me.
-
- And now, slightly less me.
-
- How do you like it when *I'M* late for a date? I ate your dinner. Check it out, Garfield.
- My collection is almost complete!
- Just one more fingernail! Is winter over? You're the best girlfriend ever!
- And you're the best pet ever!
- WE could do better. The world could use more rainbows and butterflies. Jon was under the sink fixing a leak...
- And hopping bunnies. When Odie jumped on him...
- Real cute ones! And that's how he got the concussion.
-
-
-
- CAMERA
-
- Oh, Garfield. I had a really, really good day!
-
- That guy sure looked a lot like Jon. You should try taking a candy bar out of its wrapper before you eat it.
- Oooo...
- Fancy. Oh, how I suffer!
- Check that.
- Oh, how I make others suffer! So ask yourself...
- What is the difference between a winner and a loser?
- A winner does not scream into his security blanket. Oops. Loser. Sometimes dreams do come true.
- Z
- Nope. You're still not a pepperoni pizza. My aunt Edna has a bad habit.
- She was a finger licker.
- But not her own. A lonely, lonely woman.

- What's it like out there? March. Why does everything go wrong?!
-
- Oh, yeah. I'm not perfect.
-
- I'm picking up your sarcasm, Garfield. And, for good measure... ECHO POINT Meow.
- Oink.
- I'm not fat! It says ""ignore an irritant and it will go away"".
-
- Liars. Any other suggestions? Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Breathe! Don't faint! Don't faint! Don't faint!
- Ow ow ow ow ow! Happes every time Jon removes a bandage. See my wallet photos, Garfield?
- One of Liz...one of you and Odie...
- And Mary Everes Boodle. The inventor of string art. Hmmmm...
- Chinese? Nah...Italian?
- Nah... Sushi? Nah... Mexican?
- Nah... Burgers? Nah... Pizza?
- I know! Why don't we just do Tofu? SAY...that's a
- GAH
- ...terrible idea. Ribs? Z
- GAH!
- Waking up is an annoying way to start a day. What's that, Fluffy? Meow meow
- What are you trying to tell me, Fluffy? MEOW! MEOW! MEOW! MEOW!
- I wish I could understand you, Fluffy. He says he hates being called ""Fluffy"". Arf
- CUT!
- You couldn't memorize that? The universe is enormous.
- Big deal. Tell me something interesting.
- Like, how much of it is frosting? This is nice.
- Yes, it is.
- HOW CAN IT BE NICE IF WE'RE NOT EATING, YOU WEIRDOS?! Z
- Z
- Z Might as well go to bed.
- HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- What a funny video! Replay
- That cat is so fat, he gets stuck in the pet door!
- Garfield's gotta see this...hey, GARFIELD!
- CRAAAAAACK RIIIIP
- Yes? YAWN!
- Bored?
- Boring? I've got some paperwork to do.
- Jon? Paperwork?
- Ah. I'm going to write my autobiography!
-
- All done. What took you so long? I bought you kitty diet food.
- PLUNK
- That has to last. You are not going to like tomorrow's headline. You look sleepy.
- Darn...
- I was going for sleepy-but-handsome. I can't believe how lazy you are.
- I'm not surprised.
- Jon was also shocked to find out the world is round. More tea, Poopsie? Yes, Snoogums.
- Oh, Rathbone, this picnic was a SPLENDID idea! I thought you'd enjoy it, Mimsy...
- I do so AWFULLY love you, you know. Oh, Ratsy, I'm so ridiculously happy!
- Wow, Jon...YOU picked this movie? I thought it was one we could all enjoy.
- ...and I love beiong out here with you, and the sun, and the clouds, and the birds, and the grass, and the trees...
- And the 50-foot ants...
- YAAAAHHHHH!! Here's the part WE like. Not all cats are lazy you know, Garfield.
- I agree.
- There are also the liars. I'm not afraid of a challenge.
-
- As long as it doesn't come in the house. Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
-
- Please don't encourage him! The world seems to be getting along without you. Okay.
-
- How about now? Let's order dessert. Shh. Not so loud.
- What do you mean?
- Jon! Liz! Imagine running into you here! Through hard work, we will succeed.
-
- We will not succeed.
-
- squeak squeak squeak
- mew mew mew
- bark bark bark
-
- moo moo moo
- You're missing out an awful lot.
- That's kind of the idea. I demand my rights!
-
- With chocolate syrup!
- BARK!
- That IS a dog. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
-
- Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. You know who's a good kisser? No.
- Liz.
- You know HOW I know? How come we never discuss sports?! zzzzzz YAWN
- zzzzzz YAAAWWNNN zzzzzz
- It might've been funny to you, but not so much to me. zzzzzz Right this way...
- Now, next I'll be showing you a four-leg, two-ear condo. It's a perfect flea starter home.
- The grounds are lovely. Yes, they're all maintained by the Hoeowner's Association...and here's the unit.
- Ooh, how retro. We call this ""mid-century-modern cat."" Older, but still quite stylish.
- Why are the owners selling? They're a couple of ticks who are retiring and moving to a greyhound in Florida.
- Honey, I love this place...we should buy it! Okay! Fantastic!
- Let's go back to my office, and we'll write up an offer! I have a Homeowner's Association? Why don't you just lie there and do nothing?
- Consider it done!
- I was being sarcastic. Sorry, no longer listening.
- I have a can of frosting and two spoons.
- You do know how to enter a room. Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf... pat pat pat
- Z
- What kind of introduction is that? Sometimes when you're down in the dumps...
- I mean, WAY down in the dumps...
- You find a cookie! Garfield, I'm going out with Liz.
- Cool. I'll stay here with the food.
-
-
- The last time he smiled like that was when he bought the cheap cat food. Um...
- Jon, there's a spring gardening show downtown today...would you like to go?
- Seriously? Uh, yes...
- Sure! Really?
- Absolutely! Just give me a second!
- Wow. That was easier than I thought.
- What is it? Just grab your purse, and run like the wind. I never seem to get anything done.
- Me neither.
- And I'M trying. You got me there. I could be an action hero.
-
- But I've got the wrong kind of shoes. I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON! AROOOOOO!
- OOOOOOO!
- Why is Odie howling at a balloon? No moon tonight.
- Ants...
- I'm hoping they know where there's a picnic. I wanted to be a cowboy when I grew up. Aw.
- You must have been a cute little boy.
- I didn't tell her it was last thursday. You were still wearing the hat friday. My car ran out of gas today.
- THREE times!
- How is that even possible?! Did you know cats don't leave fingerprints?
- He can't see me, for I have ninja skills.
- I have stealth and cunning...
- I have the element of surprise...
- * BWING
- SMACK
- Aaaand...I have a text from mom. And THIS is why a cat will never be president.
-
- Whew! Spring is in the air, Garfield.
- And look at you, smiling.
- You have spring fever! I just ate a songbird. YIP!
- shoop
- Where's Odie? I dunno. He said something about termintes and left. Uh...
- What? You're doing that wong.
- Hey! Who's the spider here?! I told Liz about that terrible thing you did.
- Uh...
- Could you be more specific? I spend most of my day barking at stuff.
- That's cool...
- And I thought I was special.
- Every day is just like another around here.
- * I'VE DECIDED TO SIIIING EVERYTHING I SYA! **
- ** ISN'T THAT GREEEEAT? *
-
- * YESSSSS, IT IIIIIIS! *
- Mmmmph. Why can't every day be just like another around here? After a long day of doing nothing, it's good to relax.
- Although it's hard to know where one ends and the other begins.
-
- We've had a lot of rain.
-
- Okay, okay. So you don't need me. I had a busy, busy day.
- And I'll hve another one tomorrow.
- You would make a terrible cat. Where should we go on out vacation, Garfield?
- The kitchen!
- I don't know why I talk to you. We can set up a tent next to the refrigerator. ...then Liz called a paramedic.
- And I was trying to tell her...
- That's just how I dance! Have you considered that she may have called the paramedic for herself? * * *
- * * *
-
-
-
- sigh
- ptoo
- *
- * If spiders didn't exist, who would care?
- Hel-LO?!...
- My mom!
- BURP!
- That was unnecessary! The cabbage and onions beg to differ. Don't tell Odie, but sometimes I enjoy being around the little fella.
-
- Me and my big thought balloon... Jon has his faults.
- I HAVE FLEAS!
- And one of mine. I like you, Garfield.
-
- I'm going to bake some cookies. And I LOVE you, lady! Someday I'd like to walk on the moon.
- Cool.
- Bring back a pizza with extra cheese. Garfield
-
-
- Yes, there's no cherry on top of your food.
- That's because we HAVE no cherries.
- And if you think I'm going out cherry shopping just for you, you're NUTS!
- We have those by the jar, you know. My coffee is cold. Duh, Jon. It's iced coffee.
-
- And there's somethig in it. Ice. You know what this world needs?
- More cat hair! On it!
- I was being sarcastic! Too late. Odie wrote an essay about how dogs are better than cats.
- Burp
- And then he ate it. Does anyone want to borrow my copy of ""Swatting Spiders"" magazine?
- No, thank you.
- Already seen it. Arlene, I've written a love poem.
- Would you like to hear it?
- Is it to yourself? It's entitled ""Orange is the new sexy"". There might be a few things I'm not good at.
- With one glaring exception...
- You, sir, are a genius at understatement. Calculating route...
- Proceed up back steps, and through pet door.
- Continue across living room, and turn right into hallway.
- Proceed down hallway for twenty yards, then bear left.
- Continue for eleven feet. You have reached your destination.
- Wow, this thing really works.
- I asked for directions to Nirvana. Z
- ENCORE! ENCORE!
- Z You lack class.
- Nonsense...
- BURP! Cats are sophisticated.
- PANT! PANT! PANT! PANT! PANT! PANT! PANT! PANT!
- Dogs, not so much. BURP
- And just when you thought that it couldn't get any better...
- BURP! Hello, doctor.
- Everything's fine.
- The less she knows, the better.
- Toothpaste on a saltine? Uh, no, thanks.
- And no grocery shopping!
- Sigh...
- I feel fat, Garfield.
- You?... fat?! ...Nonsense!
- You are NOT fat, Liz!
- Trust me, if anyone knows what fat is, *I* should know!
- See? Now THAT'S fat! Remember the old days, when we were bored all the time? Yeah.
- This is just like that. Yeah.
- It's nice to know we still got it. You da man. BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! Oh, pew!
- Your breath is awful!
- He says that like it's a bad thing. Here I am...hopelessly stuck up this tree...
- Garfield! Cocoa!
- With a marshmallow?!
- A hole in one! THWOCK!
- Liz likes ME more than she likey YOU.
-
- Liz also likes broccoli! I'll never forget the time I bumped my head.
- I'll never forget the time I bumped my head.
- I'll never forget the time I bumped my head. TRY!
- I'm going on a hike, Garfield.
- Yes, out into the wilderness...
- MAN AGAINST NATURE!
-
- THUD
- Little help? Perhaps you should make camp there for the night. And them mom said, ""Stay and have another cup of tea, Jonny."" And I said, ""No, thanks, mom. Gotta go home and bore the cat"" Ha! Ha!
-
- Garfield? Z Whenever I'm having a bad day...
- I like to spend some time with Jon.
- I don't think that these are my shoes... Swatting spiders is fun. I don't think so.
- SMACK!
- Are you sure? Okay, now I'm pretty sure. I'm not the same cat I used to be.
- BURP!
- Now I am. I've ordered us an eight-course meal! ** ding-dong
- Really?! Wow! ...and here it is!
- Four courses are missing. Handling charge. BURP! BURP! BURP! BURP! BURP! BURP! BURP! BURP!
- ...and all is well!
- I gotta get a new clock.
-
-
-
-
- Want to see all your friends at once? Blow up a pool. Z Don't you drive the ice cream truck? Well, I was passing by, and... I can't remember why I walked into this room.
- Maybe if I went out, and came back in.
- Great. Now I can't remember why I walked into THIS room! All right, I'm ready to walk into the room again, and this time I know WHY!
-
- Okay, three out of five.
- You forgot why you walked into this room, right? No, I didn't!
- I forgot why I got out of BED this morning. I can't remember why I walked into this room.
- WHACK
- What was THAT for?! I hate to waste a trip. I can't remember why I walked into this room. You must be getting OLD. SMACK
- And cranky! How does that look for your birthday cake? I have one slight change.
-
-
- *
- Now I KNOW I walked into this room for a reason...
- Because I wrote it down!
- And THAT'S how you outsmart old age!
-
- OH, YEAH!
- I'm eating cereal straight out of the box!
- There must be a full moon. You wait here while I go get us a snack.
- BWA-HA-HA-HAHH! Uh-oh.
- That's his nutritious laugh. This day is off to a good start.
- What a great day! Aren't you getting up? Why ruin it? I'm in the best mood ever!
- KICK!
- But I still take my work seriously. What have you two been up to?
- We were just waiting for the prettiest girl in the world to stop by!
- Awwww X You can make mine a kitty liver treat. BREAD CRUMBS!
- GOBBLE GOBBLE CRUNCH CRUNCH SNARF GULP GOMP GOMP nom nom
- That could've gone worse. Tell me about it. munch munch
- Ahhhhh...
- There's nothing like a spa on a nice summer day.
- The relaxing bubbles and soothing... pant pant pant pant pant
- Hey! Did I say you could take a break?!
- I've gotta get that jet fixed. FFFFFFFFFFFF straws
-
- I like to stick with what works. I'm the last person to tell you what's wrong with this world.
- ACCORDION PLAYERS RULE!
- But, I have my suspicions. Odie will be filling in for me today. BOOT!
- Perfect!
-
- It's a small world.
- LIKE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES! You know what's fun? Shoe shopping!
- Uh...
- Uhhhh... That's good, Jon. Keep that up intil she loses interest and wanders off. Jon doesn't know much.
- I can tell that you want something. Hmmm. Probably food.
- But he does know just enough. Oh, Garfield,
- Liza and I are going to a movie, and I won't be back until 6:00.
- You won't mind if I feed you an hour late, will you?
-
-
-
- Or I could have the theater pause the movie at 4:55, and rush home. If it's not too much trouble. It's too hot to even move.
-
- My kind of weather. Appearently the planet Earth forgot to pay its light bill today!
- What in the world does that mean?
- munch munch munch
- Hey!
- Odie ate his own food before I could!
- jog jog jog jog jog
- It's good to take a break every so often. Let's just stick with the basics on our shopping list, Garfield. check
- The bare essentials of survival. check
- Fudge pops? checkarooni The TV remote is all across the room.
- Guess there's only one thing to do.
- Hope my telekinetic powers decide to kick in!
- Hey, Garfield...
- Do you feel like
- Nope...can't.
- Garfield! Want to
- Sorry, I'm booked.
- Not today, pal.
- I love sundays...
- The one day of the week when you actually make plans to do nothing! Sigh
- I can't go on like this.
- Now, THIS... So...
- How's the summer trating you?
- ...Mr. Snowman. Warm day.
-
- TOO warm. Sometimes I feel like life's passing me by.
- AAAAAAAAANTS!!!
- And I'm fine with that. Oooo-weee! Check that out!
- Where have you BEEN all my life?!
- What is he doing? Ogling the ice crea cones. I think I'm in LOVE! Help! I can't swim!
- Ha! Ha! Just kidding!
- Fish are not funny.
- When I was a little girl, my family would visit my grandma's house every summer.
- She had a big backyard, and every night after dinner she'd make two bowls of strawberry ice cream...
- And grandma and I would sit in the backyard, eating ice cream and counting the fireflies together.
- The memory of that little tradition has always made summer nights special for me.
- FIREFLIES!!!
- Oh, how I miss those days. 73. My life is... YAWN
- I'm hoping to... YAWN!
- Notice how I can finish your sentences? I think I should probably go grocery shopping.
- I agree wholeheartedly.
- When you get down to sucking soy sauce packets, it's time. Kiss me! Ugh! No way, you fat, ugly, disgusting pig!
- SMACK! At least I'm not flat. Help!
- Hey! You, at that picnic!
- Throw me a sandwich! Geez, Jon, there's a lot of SUGAR and FAT on your shopping list.
- Maybe you should cross off a couple of things.
- I could live without the toothpaste and toilet paper. Remember when you brought me flowers?
- No.
- Exactly... Am I missing something?
- CLICK Darn it! And we're out of light bulbs! Let's go to the store, Garfield. I'll start the car.
- Why do bad things always happen to me? I am such a loser!
- Congratulations! You are our MILLIONTH customer!
- How does it feel to be MR. ONE MILLION?! This is the greatest moment of my life!
- What a great day! Could it be that I'm no longer a loser? Could it be that I'm now a WINNER?!
- CLICK Darn it! I'll start the car. I'm goimg to run around the block.
-
- Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeal slowly. Jon is the most interesting guy I know.
- I just sorted my socks!
- He's the ONLY guy I know.
- Time marches on.
- That would not have been my guess. I'm going to throw myself a surprise party.
-
- Gosh, I hope I don't suspect anything. No chance of that. BAT
- Excuse me...
- Have you seen my ball of yarn, miss? Hark! I hear my prey approaching now!
-
- Gosh, I sure am hot and cheesy! I love this dream.
- Uh-oh...looks like I'm out of clean shirts.
- Maybe there's one in the laundry pile that's still okay.
- This one doesn't look too terrible.
- I'll give it the ol' sniff test.
- SNIIIIIIFFFFFFF
- Yeah...that's not bad. I'll warn Liz.
- ZOMBIE CAT!
- Only until I have that first cup of coffee. Hey!
- Stop watching this!
- Go outside and exercise! I love comedy. Oh, no!
- I'm going to kick Odie off the table!
- If only there was a way to prevent it! KICK! I've seen this twenty times.
-
- Fell asleep nineteen. When Liz gets here, be nice. Okay.
- SLAP!
- I said, ""BE NICE""! ""WHEN LIZ GETS HERE""!
- KNOCK IT OFF, SUMMER!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha. ECHO POINT
- MEOW!

- Boys! Boys! Don't be mean to each other!
- fft grr Or me.
- Go get him, Jon!
- Go get him, Garfield! Beat you to it. **
- What's the name of that song you're whistling? ""Dogs are dumb"".
- ** Catchy.
- You're late.
- But the important thing is I couldn't think of anything better to do. And you're toast!
- You're nice. Why, thank you, Jon.
- Really nice. How sweet.
- Really, really nice. Okay.
- Really, really, really nice. Yeah.
- Really, really, really, really nice. Uh, Jon...
- Really, really, really, really, really nice. I COULD STOP!
-
- I do believe you've crossed that fine line between nap and stupor. Jealous much? It's a beautiful day, isn't it, Garfield?
- Garfield?
- You're pathetic. It lacks plot. Odie is digging up a bone.
-
- Now he's finding a place to bury it. My school football team.
- Before each game we'd yell our cheer...
- MOMMY! Explains the losing season. Liz...what a beautiful name!
- Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz...
- Where are you going? To change my name to Betty. Say, are you the cat who's friend with that dog?
- What if I am?
- Where did I put that saw? HELP!
- This is a test...
- THis is a test of the Cat Emergency Broadcast System.
- This is only a test.
- MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOW
- This has been a test of the Cat Emergency Broadcast System. Had this been an actual cat emergency, and had you been a cat...
- You'd have slept through it anyway. Z YAWN
- YAWN
- Synchronized boredom. sigh Ever notice how clouds look like other things, Garfield? Do tell.
- That cloud looks like a rabbit.
- If rabbits could fly. AND WERE MADE OF WATER VAPOR! Ah-ha!
- What? I saw you wag your tail when you saw me.
- Stupid tail! You like me! Want to gnaw on the woodwork?
- No, thanks. OKay.
- Now, there's a question you don't get asked every day.
- Purrrr

- It's diet time.
- Save yourselves! I used to be a boulder. Now I'm a pebble. Hmmm.
- That's it!
- The erosion diet! Diet food.
-
- Diet food scowl. Hmm.
- Is your broth thin and tasteless enough?
- You have a cruel sense of humor, Jon Arbuckle. This diet is killing me.
- You've been on diet before.
- What's the secret? If you tickle a child, they'll drop the candy. It's bedtime.
- And Jon is going to read me a bedtime story.
- ""Preheat the oven to 350 degrees..."" Sigh
- A. summer.

- No reason? Nope.
- You mean I get a kiss just for SITTING here? Yup.
-
- Love's pretty cool. So I've noticed. It's 11:59 PM
- In one minute it will be tuesday.
- If my watch stops, does it stay monday? Don't even go there. I'm nicewr to you than you are to me.
- You know what, Jon? You're right.
- And let's never change.
-
- Why is it that dogs chase things they don't really want to carch? I'm my own boss.
-
- And I decided to give myself the afternoon off. Come on, now...you guys need at least ONE vegetable on your shopping list.
-
- Onion rings. Technically a vegetable. All right, loophole boy!
- SLAP
- It's a cruel world.
- Surrender, human! We are from the planet Clarion!
- And we have come to conquer your planet and take its lettuce!
- Lettuce? Our primary source of nutrition! We demand your lettuce!
- Sorry, I don't have any lettuce. You don't?
- I COULD order a pizza, though. A what?
- Well, how did it go? We're defecting. BURP I'm working on my bored expression.
-
- You look bored. Yeees! They say not to go grocery shopping when you're hungry.
- They say you end up buying things you don't really need.
- Like a drum of peanut butter. What do ""they"" know? BARK! BARK! BARK!
- You should only bark if there's a good reason.
- BARK! BARK! BARK! Is ""barking for fun"" a good reason? I'm staring at you.
- And ignoring you at the same time.
- Okay, that's creepy. Thank you. You know what I like about you, Garfield?
- Oh, wow. It could be any number of things.
- Not your modesty. Cool, that narrows it down. Ah, the morning stares...when the lights are on, but nobody's home.
- Watch this, they won't even notice that I'm replacing their pet food with table scraps.

- CATCH of the DAY STU I hate him. The future is bright!
- Glowing with a luminescence that fills the room!
- Check that. I'm looking at a lamp. Hey, fatso! I just want you to know that you don't scare me!
- I don't? Nope. Spiders have eight lives, you know.
- That's eight LEGS. Oops. Pick a card, any card.
- But don't...
- eat it. munch munch So long! Have a good day!
- I'll miss you!
- The pizza guy gets a better send-off than I do. You don't bring me pepperoni. I had a busy day today.
- Oh, so did we.
- What did you do? Uhhh... Sorry. No follow-up questions.
- Someday you will be replaced by a donut-frying robot.
- What are you talking about? Progress, baby.

- I mean, when we were first dating he used to embarrass me on a almost-daily basis. Really? Not hourly?
- It's nice to see how much he's matured since then. Poor Liz. Poor, naive liz.
- I'll be out on the front lawn performing my interpretative dance to Mister Spring.
- THUD You were saying? Wow...
- Look at the grass grow.
- I love action. Where did you go, tree?
- I'm on vacation.
- Vacation? I'm a surfboard on Maui.
- PUNT
- The classics are always in style. I'm cooking dinner!
- Yah! I'm burning dinner!
- I'm ordering pizza. You should cook more often. Remember the time I got stuck in a trash can? I sure do!
- That was so...
- Tragic...so tragic. Hee-hee. I'm going to use a dog whistle to call a bunch of mutts to pester Jon.
- SSSSSSSSSS
- Oops. This must be my snake whistle.

-
- GARFIELD!
-
- Attaboy, Garfield! Thanks.
- We got you one, too. Some worry about oversleeping.
- Not me, though.
- I worry about over-waking. Garfield, would you like to go jogging with me?
-
- No.
- Odie's not as dumb as I thought.
- BARK BARK BARK BARK He's dumber. I'm afraid I have bad news, Curtis. Give it straight to me, Doc.
- You have a severe...nut allergy.
- NOOO!! Tough break for a squirrel. Willpower.
- Willpower.
- Indulgence power! SLURRRRK
- Ahhhhhhhh
- Needs more cat food.
-
-
-
-
-
- Doe slife get any better than this, Garfield?
-
- I hope so. It had better. Time to walk by the neighbors.
-
- We have a history. I just don't feel motivated to bark at you.
- I just soaked my feet in your water dish.
- Thanks! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! Happy to do my part.
-
- GARFIELD! He who eats first, eats best. Z
- Hey, Garfield! Today is National Cartoonists Day! You woke me for that?
- Ants are eating my candy bar!
-
- You should learn something new every day, Garfield. Ants are crunchy. BARK! BARK!
-
- plop
- Okay, okay, I'll play.
- I'm gonna make you run, though...
- Prepare to chase this into the next time zone, Odie!
- You're good. Garfield, guess what I did today!
- I actually READ instructions!
- Next I'm going to read a map and ask for directions! Man card...hand it over. STAY OFF THE GRASS
- STAY OFF THE GRASS
- STAY OFF THE ""STAY OFF THE GRASS"" SIGN Oh, come on! I've been training for the theater
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Dramatic pause! That is so stupid. Climbing a tree is challenging.
- Yeah, for the TREE, lardo
-
- I'm going to wear cleats. I kid! Garfield, does this gap in my teeth make me look silly?
- Arlene, you could never look silly.
- Always be sincere...whether you mean it or not. It's almost time for lunch.
-
- Which means there's just enough time for breakfast.
- I had a cat when I was a little girl. A beautigul tabby, like you.
- Her name was Tiger, and she was my best friend. We did everything together,,,ate, slept, played...
- She even inspired me to become a veterinarian, to help other animals. I miss her so much.
- Anyway, I just wanted you to know it's good to have a cat in my life again.
-
- If Jon doesn't marry you, *I* will. Z
- Staring contest.
- Or not. It's not easy being fish.
- How so?
- Our potato chips are really soggy! Yew!! ARF!ARF! ARF!
- See? I can speak ""dog""!
- You just said ""my elbow is a potato"". I always try my best.
- Here comes my favorite part.
- Then I fail. That's my favorite part. If I turn my head just right...
- I can pick up a radio station with my teeth!
- Uh... I know a way back out. HYAAAH!
- Just kidding!
- You need to learn to relax.

- Don't you have anything to do? Yes, I do.
- I'm binge-watching the ceiling. Cats have many talents.
-
- TAH-DAH! Not everything os my fault.
- BOOT!
- Just the good stuff. Garfield!
- Have you seen my razor?!
- No, but your potato peeler has had it. Do you ever think about our future together, Garfield? Nope.
- No?
- I'm too busy enjoying out ime together right now. Purr. Cotton is better than wool! Wool is better than cotton!
- WOOL HEAD! COTTON MOUTH!
- What do YOU thibk? Yeah! Who's better?! I'm staying out of this.

- Hello? Hi, it's the Pizza Parlor.
- We're just calling to let you know how much we love you.
- * SMOOOOOCH *
- * click *
- Perhaps we order pizza too much. Said no one ever.
- BEWARE OF PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
- Like there needs to be a sign. A cat can make a toy out of anything.
- A paper bag, for instance.
- My lunch was in there! That will be difficult to prove. BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
-
- Sorry. I thought I heard the can opener. Focus. These buttermilk pancakes taste plain, Irma. Did you put buttermilk in them?
- Let me check.
- Silly me! I put water in them!
- Meaning...the buttermilk went into the coffee maker. Ah, friday...
- Almost quitting time.
- Can't wait to relax. ""Great Moments in Cat History""...
- The invention of the tuna-flavored milk shake. sniff
- This has been ""Great Moments in Cat History"".

-
- Are you quite done? Just one more.
- You lie there while I do everything around here.
- Finally a plan we can all get behind!
- Well? What do you have to say?
- Looks better on me.
-
- LICK LICK LICK LICK Some fish can fly.
- Really?!
- But the lines at the airport are so long. Oh, don't even start! I have Garfield's test results...
- But I think there's som esort of error.
- It says his blood is 20 percent marinara sauce. How are my cheese levels? I love everybody!
- Me, too!
- Although some could use a little salt.
- I think I'll clean out my closet today...
- It's just so small...
- sip sip
-
- ZANG
- MUST BUILD BIGGER CLOSET!!! I GET LUMBER! What are you looking at, cat?
- A photo album. A photo album? What's that?
- It's where we old folks used to post our selfies. Ah. You mean people in the old days used to print out their photos and then paste them into books? Yes.
- That sure seems like a lot of work. They had plenty of time.
- Didn't they have dinosaurs to hunt? Only on tuesdays. Here's another old picture of me.
- It was take the first time Jon put me on a diet.
- Why is your face so lumpy? I'm storing cookies in my cheeks. Look, Garfield, here's you as a kitten.
- Wow, you were fat even then.
- I mean, ""awwwww"". I've decided I don't want to make a big deal out of my birthday this year.
- Now that I'm older and wiser, I'm realizing the things that mean the most to me...
- A dump truck full of presents and a ginormous cake are all I really need. You're drooling. YAWN
- KRIK
- I'm at that age where YAWNING is risky.
- HUHHHHHHH
- FOOOOOF
- FOOOOOF
- FOOOOOOF
- Okay, I'm ready...
- BRING ON THE BIRTHDAY CAKE! It's my birthday!
- SPLOT
- Aaand it's also monday. Hey, you're prett yold. You should meet my grandmother. She's the oldest person I know.
- She's so old that she's seen it all. And done it all. She's REALLY old.
- How old is she? Two! Hey, Garfield, today is the first day of summer!
- Time to hit the ol' wading pool!
- Tah-dah! Hello, summer-goodbye, dignity. I love summer!
-
- But it doesn't love you. We're not taking a vacation this year.
- Really?
- I thought we were on one.
-
- Is it warm out? Somewhat.
- Boy, it's hot! It is.
- I could use something cold to drink. Good idea.
- snap snap!
-
-
- What about ME?! Get your own cabana mouse. I have friday on my mind...
-
- But monday on my calendar. All right! All right!
- You can have half of my sandwich!
- Good things come to those who whine. ""Dear Ask A Dog""...
- ""If you chase a car and catch it, what happens then?""
- That is highly illegal, my friend. GARFIELD!
- You ate everything in the kitchen! Not so.
- EVERYTHING! Here's the twist of the bread bag. Have you considered planting a vegetable garden?
- No, he has not.
- Uh, no. Now, a small plot of bacon might be nice. Cat food...
- GULP!
- If I'm hungry enough, I'll eat anything. eew
- Oh, Irma.
- Yes? There's a fly in my mashed potatoes.
- SCHWAT!
- Dit I get it? Dit I get it? dig dig dig
- Hah-HA!
- No charge for that. Why do we come here? For the ambience. There's ugly...
-
- and then there's monday-morning ugly. What a crowd!
- All these people coming to the faily reunion!
- Have you ever seen so many tractors? I think I'm overdressed. Come closer!
- Closer!
- Uh, too close. Look, Garfield! I found a lucky horseshoe!
- knock knock
- There's a horse with a limp at the door, and he doesn't look happy. What would you like to do tonight, Garfield?
- Eat garbage, yowl on the fence, dodge shoes, trash-talk some dogs, then get chased up a tree.
- So, the usual. If it ain't broke... You should always follow my lead.
-
- I don't know about ""always"".
-
- GARFIELD!
-
-
- shoof
- hummmmm GARFIELD! The only good thing about monday morning is the coffee.
- GLUB
- Mmm...toasty, with notes of cheese and a soapy finish. Hey! I'm trying to bathe here! Think before you act.
-
- How about if I think and then just lie here. Odie has discovered the secret to happiness.
-
- I think I'll remain depressed. * MROOOW **
- SHUT UP!
- Did somebody say ""encore""? Liz wants me to go furniture shopping with her.
- She wants to buy a credenza.
- I don't even know that that is! It's Italian for ""your bachelor life is over"". Oops.
-
- Caught that sandwich before it hit the floor.
- I want some attention.
- Pay attention to me! SLAP!
- Hey! That hurt!
- Why did you hurt me?! -You are an awful, awful cat!
- BAD CAT! BAD CAT! Why, I oughta... That's better. Nothing can stop me today, Garfield!
- How ironic.
- Nothing can START me. Who knows what the future holds.
-
- But I know that it involves a water balloon.
- Whoa! Take it easy there, Odie!
- Better. Slightly pungent with a hint of nuttiness.
- Earthy, like walking through a meadow after a spring rain.
- Cheese snobs. Aristocratic yet humble. Indubitaly. Liz yawned on our date tonight...
-
- ONLY ONCE! Mister Excitement! I'm sleepy!
- Yes, sir!
- Although it's not one of my best efforts.
- Hey, guys, check out the moon...
- It looks happy, doesn't it?
- When I was a boy, we called that a ""smiling moon"".
- Kids sure do think of some funny things.
-
- It takes longer...
- ...every morrning...
- ...to resemble myself.
- This is interesting...
- Van Gogh said that orange is the color of insanity. That's crazy. You just ate, so you'll have to wait half an hour to swim.
- Of course, by then you'll be hungry again. Hmm
- You know, you may never swim again. The math doesn't look good. With age comes wisdom.
- Sigh
- I'd rather have a new television. That's very wise. Hey, Odie!
- Jon was just elling me he wishes you would bark manically in his face.
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! Happy birthday, Jon! Some people dream in black and white.
- Some people dream in color.
- I dream in pizza toppings. * ** * * ** * ** * **

-
- IF it happens. Don't be mean, kids.
- BOOT!
- Leave that to the professionals. I wonder why I never get a treat.
- If you're a good boy today, I'll give you a treat.
- Ah.
-
- He really hates camping, doesn't he? That's a long stick! It's diet time, Garfield! We're going on a fast!
-
- We're going off a fast! That was a terrifying three seconds!

- YOU JUST RUINED a PERFECTLY BAD MOOD! Wouldn't it be great if we could travel back in time?
- I'd go back to my first day of kindergarten.
- This time I'd KNOW where the little boys' room was before it was too late. I'd travel before this conversation took place. So hot.
- You should wear a hat.
- So hot. So embarrassing.
- SLURRRRRR
- GAAAH! Hot hose water. Odie, come back! I need to dry you off.
- Not a problem.
- You bed seem pretty absorbent. Sigh...
- I need to become the man that Liz deserves.
- Technically, that would be another man. I just finished a leisurely breakfast.
- Hey...
- I MISSED LUNCH! So...
- So you worked in the yard yesterday without a shirt on?
- Yes. It was pretty hot and sunny. Did you wear sunscreen?
- Yeees. All over?
- Yes, mother. Really? Even on your back?
- SLAP! YES!
- bust-ed.
- Bored?
- No, thank you. I already am. SSSSSSSS
- SSSSSSSS
- Isn't that quite enough? SSSSSS Said the jealous Jon. ""Dear Ask A Dog""...
- ""If you were on the moon, would you howl at the earth?""
- And no, you're not going to go find out.
-
- Why are you back in bed? Duh. It's dark out. Guess how many jelly beans I can fit in my mouth.
- How many? One.
- Because somebody TOOK the rest of them! The rascal. I was crossing the street this morning, and...
- Z
- All of Jon's stories are bedtime stories.
-
-
- Look, Garfield...a dead possum. Oh, ick.
- That's disgusting. How utterly gross.
-
- click! The art of conversation: alive or dead?
- I counted my fingers three times and got three different answers.
- A moment of silence, please. Grrrrrr...
- BARK!
- Did you see how I built the suspense with the growl? I was on the edge of my seat. I'm a spider now, but someday I'll be a beautiful butterfly!
- No, you'll always be a spider. Really?
- Really. Nyah! Nyah! Nyah! Oh, shut up! The yard needs mowing. So?
- The candy bars need eating. So?
- The dishes need washing. Wait. What was the one before that? What are you doing, Garfield?
- Looking at pictures of food on my phone.
- Ah, romance. You got that right, lady! ECHO POINT M

- Meow!
- Let me finish!
- I think Liz and I are getting really serious, Garfield. Oh?
- Today we went to Binky Burger for lunch...
- And she actually shared her soft drink with me! Wow.
- AND her french fries! That IS serious.
- Maybe it's time to take our relationship to the next level. I don'r know, Jon...
- Onion rings are a big step. I'm good at what I do.

- Nothing to do.
- Let's go somewhere and do something! Boy, we are on different planets. ...what do you think of that? Wha...?
- Tuna!
- That's my fallback answer for when I haven't been paying attention.

- HI, THERE! POO!
- Oh! Did I startle you?
- You really jumped.
- That was pretty funny.
- Sort of. Let's do nothing today.
- Well, okay...
- As long as it doesn't interfere with my plans to goof off. I heard a funny joke today.
- But I don't remember the punch line.
- Oh, well, ""knock knock"" Don't.
- Paradise <--
- No way.
- I'm pretty sure that paradise would be downhill. A fish walks into a diner and the waitress says, ""What will you have?""
- And the fish says, ""WATER""! Oh, how sad! Go away!
- Hello? Eddie?... A fish walks into a diner... Life is easier when you have someone to shar eit with.

- Yum. Here you go, Garfield. Tuna-flavored cat food!

- When did they stop making actual tuna? Oh, no!

- Are you going to answer the phone, or should I get it? You get it. Wow, Jon...how did you get your christmas tree to stand so straight?
- Oh, it wasn't hard at all, Liz...not for ME, anyway.
- It just took some basic structural engineering. He duct-taped it to a coat rack. Let's see...should I get Odie a squeaky bone or a dingle ball?
- What the heck, it's chistmas...I'll get him both!
- And what would YOU like? To slap you silly.
-
-
-
-
-
- Our giant inflatable Rudolph blew over again. I should bake some christmas cookies.
-
- I mean, I WILL bake some christmas cookies. Good call, noel boy. Well, THOSE christmas cookies didn't last long. Burrrp
- They were so good, though.
- You know you're supposed to bake them first. Now you're just boring me with details. Dear Santa, How have you been? How is Mrs. Claus? How are the reindeer and elves?
- How's your weather been? We have had a mild winter here so far.
- I like to begin with a little idle chitchat before I make with the begging. Dear Santa,
- Attached are the dimensions of our kitchen, along with the specifications for our gas hookup.
- Still trying, huh? Someday he'll bring that pizza oven. Garfield, do you hear that awful noise?! Yeah.
- It sounds like a wounded WATER BUFFALO. Not to worry...
- Or a hyena with a hernia. It's just Jon caroling. ...and here we have footage of a christmas caroler actually being heckled.
- BOOOO! BOOOO! YOU STINK! BOOOOOOOO!
- Didn't your mom make you that sweater? Garfield...Garrrr-field...GARRRR-FIEEEEEELD...
- GARRRRRRR-FIEEEEELLLLD...
- Who are you? I am the ghost of christmas past!
- Then who are you? I am the ghost of christmas present!
- Annnd that would make you... The ghost of christmas future!
-
- And you? I'm the dead bulb on your christmas tree. AAAH! Christmas shopping is easy! Now, all I have to do is enter my credit card number!
-
- tic tic tic Don't bother. I already have it memorized.
- Oh, please, oh please, oh please, oh please...
- AAAGGGHHH Every time. Good evening. I'm tonight's christmas dream. A lump of coal?
- I just have a couple of questions. Shoot.
- What's your stocking size? This is not good. Merry Christmas, Garfield!
- That is THE stupidest thing I have ever seen.
- With the exception of that. How do I look, Garfield?
- It's my new christmas sweater and antler hat!
- Don we now our nerd apparel. Maybe I just need to think more like Liz...
- If I were her, what would I want for Christmas?
- A real man? Stop with the cheey grin. Sigh... bip bip boop bip boop
- I don't know what to get you for Christmas, Liz. Ohm Jon, you don't have to get me anything.
- You tell me that every year! And then you go out and get ME something REALLY nive, and I feel like a horrible boyfriend! I bet you've already done it, haven't you?! I bet you've gotten me something really nice!
-
- Haven't you? Yes.
- You're evil. I love you, too. One week to Christmas, Pooky! Can you stand the excitement?!
-
- Don't be fooled. Under that calm exterior, he's a quivering mess. I wonder what Odie would like for Christmas. He wasn't sure.
- So I told him he might find some ideas online.
- STINKY, SMELLY THINGS
-
- You haven't lived until you've tried his homemade mousenog. Winter...
- FUMP
- has arrived.
-
- Back off. Christmas eve eve.
-
- Maximum anticipation has been achieved.
-
-
-
-
- Woo-hoo!
- MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME!
- And to you, too, Jon...
- If there's anything left over. I'm always sad when Christmas is over.
-
- Sigh And so ends another Christmas. Yup.
-
- Oh, and thanks LOADS for the cat toy. I regift because I care. Did you like my homemade Christmas stuffing, Jon?
- BURP
- Garfield did. Next year she should make enough for you, too. Do you have any resolutions for the new year, Garfield? Nope.
- You can't improve on perfection. THACK I'm taking Liz out for New Year's Eve, Garfield.
- It'll be a night of fine dining and celebrating! Ah.
- Back to Binky Burger to watch the clown drop. THE EXCITEMENT MOUNTS!
- OKAY, EVERYONE!...
- TEN!...NINE!...EIGHT!...
- SEVEN!...SIX!...FIVE!... Are you ready to officially kick off the new year, Odie?
- FOUR!...THREE!...TWO!...ONE!...
- HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! KICK!
-
- Boy, that was some party last night. I noticed. Why so tired?
- I built a snowman today.
- ""Dear Ask A Dog""...
- ""Do dogs really eat homework?""
- munch munch munch Today is the birthday of Marvin J. Fuddlestone. Who?
- He revolutionized sock-drawer organization. How dull.
- He was burried in a giant anklet. How disturbing. Three...two...
- one...
- Friday face! I just scored concert tickets!
- Two seats, front row, center!
- ""Accordion Fest: Night of a thousand Polkas""! Um... I'll distract him. You run.
- NO CATA ALLOWED
- NONE
- THIS MEANS YOU!
- HEY!
- OKAY, OKAY
- JUST ONE I'm thinking about exercising.
- Thinking about it...thinking about it...
- OKay, I'm done. Now I'm thinking about pudding. The world is my playground.
- Sigh...
- And the big kids are hogging the swings. BARK! BARK! BARK!
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Good times! I must be missing something. Hot dogs! Ice cream!
- What to do?
- What's that? A new taste sensation! WHY IS THERE A MOUSE IN THIS HOUSE?!!
- whisper whisper whisper
- For the free Wi-Fi. I forgot Liz's birthday!
- Not to worry, Jon.

- Z Garfield...
- I know it's cold out today, but...
- What if someone else wants hot chocolate? Then they should be me. Time to start off into space.
- Odie!
- ItÄs cheating if you're actually looking at something. This will be our first anniversary without my husband, Walter.
- It must be hard for you. I'm so sorry, Agnes. Thanks, Helen.
- What happened to Walter, anyway? I ate him. Let's go shoe shopping! Or...
-
- Shoe shopping it is! Wise choice. GOOD HEALTH -->

- DONUTS
-
- Hey! You call that ""Just Sitting There""?!
- You don't look NEARLY bored enough, mister!
- I'd like to see something more along THESE lines...
- And for Pete's sake, SLOUCH!
- There! That's more like it!
- It's tough living with a cat with such low standards. Odie! You call that drinking out of the toilet?! Today's the day! No more mister nice guy!
- SLUP
- MWAHAHAHAHAHA! Switching to dark roast. How evil. When I go out, do you feel sad? Oh, yeah!
- I put on a sad face, and do a sad dance...
- I'm thinking ""no"".
- ...and the sad party I throw. ECHO POINT I can't think of anything to say.
- Meow!
- Meow! Meow! Meow! Okay! MEOW! Sending a text to Liz... ""How do I love thee? Let me text the ways"". tap tap
- Oops! I sent that to Mrs. Feeny by mistake. Poor Jon.
- ping! Mrs. Feeny is wondering what I'm doing saturday night. Poor Mrs. Feeny. Is that a TIE you're wearing, Garfield?
- Yes, it is.
- I found it in a trendy little dumpster down the street. Niiice! Here's the plan, Odie. I'll hit Jon with this snowball, and you close the window before he can throw one back. Ready?
- Take that, Jon! SPLOT!
- A little quick on the draw there, Ace.
- No, I don't want to play fetch
- No, I don't need a hug.
- No, I don't know the dog secret handshake.
- And no, you can bury that yourself.
- See you later, Odie.
- Some friends wear me out. I'm out of control!
- What crazy thing will I do next?!
- Z A tree just fell on my car!
- What should I do?! Jon! Jon! Here's what you do...
- WALK to the store to buy my food. ""Dear Ask A Dog, what can I do to make my dog's breath more pleasant?""
- Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.
- Buy mint-flavored slippers.
-
- Have you tried doing sit-ups? Do you think of me often, Garfield? Oh, sure!
- Assuming that thinking of you thinking of me counts? I don't have a problem in the world!
-
- My arm is stuck! That's one. . Sorry I'm late. You're not late.
- I'm not? Nope, right on time.
- Are you sure? Absolutely.
- Well, darn.
- I had a really good excuse. Go ahead.
- There was this fire-breathing dogcatcher... Get to the ""really good"" part. 24 hors in a day.
- Or, as I like to think of it...
- 5 meals, 4 naps, 11 snacks and a couple of TV shows. I call it ""Evolution of Snowman"". ""Dear ask a dog, I'm angry with my mailman. What should I do?"" arf arf arf
- Bite him. But first... arf arf arf
- Make sure that you've had all your shots. They say that doing housework is great exercise.
- Jon! What a great idea!
- I'll clean out the refrigerator! What did you guys have for lunch today? Pizza.
- Ooo! Do you have any left? Leftover pizza?...
- In THIS house?! Yeah, there's some in the kitchen, next to the unicorn. I see by my watch...

- A STINKY
- WET DOG Okay,I'm out. Do you know that dogs are related to wolves?

- Yes, I know that pizza can feed twenty people. Or one Garfield! ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step""!
- OW!

- Have it your way. That cloud looks like a cow.
- Moo!
- Windy today. You don't know the half of it. bat
- bat
- It's not as easy as it looks. I make the world a cooler place.
-
- But even I can do only so much. Would you like to hold paws? Is there food in your paw?
- No.
- Well? I'm trying to follow your logic.
- plink OW!
- Look! You're shedding too!
-
-
-
- Come on, Odie. Show me what you've got.
- It's the quiet ones you have to watch out for. Just look at you...
- Garfield, will you ever stop being lazy?
- I could stop, but I'm no quitter, pal. Let's see what nature's up to.
-
- Out of order. I am so tired.
- Sorry, Odie. I don't have the energy to kick you today.
- We all have our disappointments. I've been giving the future a lot of thought.
- And, well...
- I don't see anything. What a waste of your past. Arlene, your eyes are like limpid pools of water. How sweet!
- With goldfish swimmming around in them... Uh...
- Tender, succulent goldfish. Okay, now you're creeping me out. It's time for Garfield's Helpful Household Hints.
- Got a squeaky hinge on a door?
- Feed your cat lasagna!
-
-
-
-
- Sigh
- What is it, Garfield? Thought I saw a bud on the rose. HOOP! HOOP! Jon is preparing for his annual ""Dance to Spring"".
- GUH! And no, he's not stretching.
- This thing gets tighter every year.
- I think you need to let out your stem. How, exactly, do bees make honey?
- MAKE honey?
- I've been buying it at the store. Idiot. BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Sorry I'm late. Shall I start over?
- Just give me a summary. Bark. Z
- The Roman Empire rose and fell again.
- Long nap... I'm finally getting my man cave! It's about time.
- I asked Liz to help me decorate. Uh-oh.
- I'm thinking a scrapbooking table over here... Goodbye man cave, hello craft room. Hey, Garfield!
- What do you think of the raisins I added to the mashed potatoes?
- zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz
- Who are you? The first housefly of spring!
- Aren't you going to welcome me?

- Why is a mouse texting you sad-faced emojis? We're out of cheese. ""Dear Ask A Dog, what's with you dogs rooting through the garbage all the time?""
- Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!
- Your denial would be more believable if you didn't have a banana peel on your head. The cheese for lunch was chewy...
- And then I realized that I'd left the plastic wrap on it!
- Funny, huh? I was going to say ""sad"". Are you still angy? Yes.
- How about now?... YES!
- ...now? YES!!! I'll be standing in a safe distance away. Times change. True.
- I used to be awesome...
- Now I'm REALLY awesome!

- It say I'll meet someone strange today.
- You are definitely strange. We're out of carrot cake. Look at this.
- A thank you note from the guy who owns the Pizza Parlor.
- Sent from his villa in the south of France! The villa that Garfield built. Hreard the news? What news?
- According to science, dogs are smarter than cats!
- Says the guy who drinks from the toilet. Cats are fast.
-
- Faster than the eye can see. Do I look cool, Liz?
- I'm over here.
- Who said that? The person who doesn't think ypu look cool. This has been a long day.
- I've been awake for minutes...
- And it seems like hours!
-
-
-
-
- POUND! POUND! POUND! POUND!
- I told you not to eat that so fast! But it's so GOOD! Salad's ready!
- Garfield?
- SALAD'S READY! I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that information. Pooky, I understand that Jon put you in the washing machne again. What was that like?
-
- He doesn't like to talk about it. Purr Are you thinking about me?
- Not at all. No?
- I was thinking about sausage craps in a dumpster behind a butcher shop. Purr! I hope you liked your dinner. Not bad.
- BURP BURP
- I give it two burps. Do you like my new shoes? Ummmm... Lie and say yes.
- Well... Lie and sy yes.
- They're kinda... You're supposed to lie and say yes. Play by the rules, dummy! We should clean the house.
- SMACK!
- Why did you do that?! Just changing the channel.
-
- Sigh...
- Jon, aren't those coals ready yet?
- Not yet.
- I don't know why they won't light.
- The bag says they're ""self-starting"". I know where he hides the donuts.
- I sneezed today. Wow.
- How DO you find the time?! I'm under a lot of pressure.
- BUURRRRRP...
- Now, not so much. Let's scurry around on the floor.
- Nah...cats don't scurry.
- Cats stroll. Guys do not like sharing their feelings. No, we do not.
-
- Sharing my feelings makes meanxious... Caaaareful. What a cutie-pie!
- Hey!
- Do you like him better than you like me? Right this second? urp sniff sniff
- SCHWAK
- I really gotta lay off the garlic bread. You want Cars?! We've GOT cars!!
- Here's a sweet 2009 minivan...candy apple red, and only driven off a cliff twice!
- ...and how about this little beauty? Just 30,000 miles, and absolutely no, that's right...NO brakes!
- ...want an economy car? Look no further! It's V-8, but only four of them work! Think of the gas savings!!
- ...like folks to know you're coming? The engine in this stuuner shrieks like a debutante at a rat convention!
- ...som come on down to Honest Arnie's Used Car Emporium, and push one of these bargains off our lot!
- He never sells anything, but he IS honest. Flat soda and day-old balloons for the kids, too! Time out!
- Ahhhhh...
- Isn't that pleasant?
- ROCK AND ROLL!!!
- I always wanted to yell that. It's over, right? Cats are better than dogs.
-
- And less moist. WILD BEAR!
- YAAAAAH!!!
- He gets a kick out of that. Liz! Jon!
- Liz!
- Come on, you owe me one. Jonnnnn... I heard a sad story today. Was it about a cat who wanted to have his ears scratched?
- Was it about a hungry cat?
- It had nothing to do with you. That IS sad.
- Wow
- This really takes me back.
- I haven't watched this movie since I was a kid.
- I wonder why...
- YAAAHH!
- Now I remember. The flying monkeys are gone now, Jon. You and I are a team, Garfield.
- And *I* am the coach. Good.
- Then YOU can be fired. I love gardening.
- I just planted vegetables.
- All our canned goods are missing! Darn. Let's have meat. You know what's fun?
- Well, do you know? Huh? Huh? Okay. I'll bite. What's fun?
- Barking at cats. I'll have to try that sometime. I haven't seen a mouse all week. Good job, Garfield!
-
- How was the vacation? Great! But it's always good to get back home. Arlene...
- Here's a picture of me to keep near your heart.
- If it were any bigger, it would be near everybody's heart. What a lovely thought! Laziness is contagious.
- Right, Jim?
- Jim?...
- Hey, Liz!
- Liz! Liz!
- Liz! Liz! Liz! Liz!
- What IS it, Jon?
- Watch this!
- BWOINNNG DONK
- OW!
- Men. Do it again! This is interesting...
- They say the key to longevity is trying new things. I agree...
- Assuming that ice cream flavors count. Somebody gave Odie a teddy bear.
-
- Sorry you had to see that. If I'm in here any longer...
- I'm going to get all pruny.
- Ha! Ha! Get it? Yeah, I know. Fish joke.
- Not everyone is impressed by you.
- Well then, not everyone is paying attention. YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK YANK RUNKITTA RUNKITTA RUNKITTA RUNKITTA RUNKITTA RUNKITTA RUNKITTA RUNKITTA

- Why, I can remember a time...
- When I didn't think about times changing.
- ""Dear Jon, I'm writing this to you to let you know that it's over between us.""
- ""I've thought long and hard about this, and it seems we're just too different for things to ever work out...""
- ""So I've decided to move away and start a new life...you will never see me again.""
- ""Please try to remember the good times we had, and just that this is for the best...""
- BURRRRP
- ""Fondly, the goldfish."" Sorry, I get gassy when I'm sad. Check the headlines...
- Finish my coffee...
- Okay, back to work. Here comes Jon.
- Try to look busy.
- Do you have an appointment? I like to be treated like a queen.
- A queen? Seriously?
- I know where there's a fish. Your majesty! You should eat more vegetables. What?
- More than I'm eating now? ...
- More than none whatsoever? Hey, Garfield, what say we go on a diet together? Sure!
- I'll make sure you only eat what you're supposed to! Of course!
- I'll watch you every waking minute! And I'll sneak food while you're sleeping! I'm eating healthier these days.
-
- Sorry, I can't say that with a straight face!
-
-
-
-
- WHO PICKED OUT MY BACON BITS?! I don't care about anything. Me neither.
- It's part of my ""tough guy"" persona. Same here.
- * DING My cupcakes are ready! Dibs! I'm not going to swat you. You're not?
- On one condition. Sure! What is it?
- Stop being creepy. Swat me. Sigh
- Time for a vacation. Right, Odie?

- Meow, meow, meow, meow No, I don't want to buy a rubber mouse.
- Telemarketer. They say love makes toe world go 'round.
- So without it, the world would stop and we would fly off and be killed?! Not literally.
- Whew! Don't bother trying to explain things to him. I got a paper cut froma book.
- Which then dropped on my foot.
- That's why I'm limping! I love books with happy endings. Okay...

- What's that?
- BARK! BARK! BARK! I walked right into that one. Are you going to stare at your phone through our entire date?
- Yes, I am.
- Cool. Hey, Garfield!
- Guess what today is.
- National Donut Day! I thought that was every day. Is there anything better than fine dining...
- And facinating conversation?
- Huh? Is there? How should I know? **
- Jon, the commercial is over! The movie is back on!
- WHAT?!
- WHAT?!
- WHAT?!!
- WHAT?!!
- WHAT?!!! Are you guys sure you're not married already? How do I do it, you ask?
- I'll tell you how I do it.
- I don't. Let's see...we should do something cultural...
- But also fun. Oooh, HERE'S a place...
- The Ice Cream Museum! I've never climbed a 40-foot fudge pop! It's hard to keep up with all the technology.
- Let me help you out, Jon.
- This...is a pencil. I'm thinking of moving the TV. What?!
- Maybe across the room. Let's see...
- That should shorten my commute from the kitchen by about six steps. Approved! GAAAHHH!
- YAH! YAH! YAH!
- How was the Thai restaurant? GAH! GAH! Does my breath smell like cheese?
- Yes, it does. Cool!
- That's what the ladies like. Good luck. * Yoooooo-hoooooo
- You haven't weighed yourself in a while. Why should I? All you do is insult me!
- Oh, I do not! Oh, yes you do!
- Every time I step on you, you make fun of my weight!
- Prove it! Fine!
- Wow. Wow what?
- You're a SUCKER, too, fat boy.
- * Oh, Garfield **
- That can't be anything good.

- Another birthday is out to get me. The older I get, the smarter I get.
- Why don't they make cars out of cardboard?
- Or the dumber others get.
-
- Don't you just love the friend who never stops reminding you that they're younger than you? I found your old scrapbook, Garfield.
- Look...
- Your first hairball! You sentimental weirdo, you. Hello, cat. I'll be this evening's 40th-birthday age nightmare.
- I don't see any age nightmare.
- Look closer.
- So you're turning 40 this week, huh? Yup.
- Wow...that's OLD.
- It is not!
- Look at me...I'm still young and youthful in everything I say and do!
- Yeah, yeah.
- Geez...kids these days.
- Okay, so I'm turning 40.
- I suppose I should look on the bright side...
- Only ten more years until I get the senior citizen's discount at Donut Barn! * Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...
- * Happy birthay, you're FOR-TY...happy birthday to0000 yoooou!
- And ma-ny mooooore. * Wow...40 years old! The things you must have seen!
- Do you remember disco?! Of course.
- In this house, it never died. So, you're now 40. Yes, I am.
-
- You look good... Aging well is the best revenge.
- BURP!
- Why do I even look at you? Because you know how to have fun. ...and then the chipmunk ate my shoes...

- It got awfully quiet in there. I ate the TV. I like this sying by Benjamin Franklin.
- ""Early to bed and early to rise...
- makes a man healty, wealthy and wise"". And lonely, dateless and boring. I'm trying to make the world a bteer place in which to live.
-
- Then make me a sandwich! Dogs are like an open book.
-
- With a few pages missing. It's okay, Garfield...
- I sewed the stuffing back into your bear.
- Cool-looking scar there, pookman. Alrene's angry with me...
- But she won't tell me why.
- And for that, I thank her. Sometimes it seems like the world has gone mad.
-
- And it's only a tiny bit my fault.
- Ummm...Liz?
- Yes? Do you think I'm a good kisser?
- The truth? Well, yeah...
- I think you're a GREAT kisser!
- SMOOOCH

- What do you do for it?
- Inquiring minds want to know. I'm sad...
- Cookie!
- It comes and goes.

- Surrender, puny earthling! You are no match for our superior...

- I'll TELL you what's wrong with the world.
- It doesn't do enough for me. Garfield, did you eat the peanuts?
- Maybe.
- You could have at least taken them out of their shells. Who has time for details? ""Dear Ask A Dog,""...
- ""What exactly is a beef by-product?""
- And the world may never know. I wish I had a super power. Yeah, right.
- What super power would YOU have?
- Like the ability to make everything taste like ice cream! My hero! We should do something. Let's go to a movie.
- Really? You'd take me to a movie? Sure.
- People drop a lot of candy and popcorn. Jon got me a smaller food dish...
- So I'll eat less.
- Good plan. Whiiiiiine
- No, you can't come in! Now leave me alone!

- PADDA PADDA PADDA PADDA PADDA PADDA PADDA PADDA BOINNG!
-
- Is it legal for cats to marry?
- Garfield?
- Are you okay? I can't feel my brain! I'm tired.
- And it#s no wonder...
- Last night I didn't get enough too much sleep. ECHO POINT BARK!
-
- That's because nothing you say is worth repeating. I'm smart.
-
- Did that sound convincing? Your shoes are on the wrong feet. Let's go dancing!
- You mean where people can SEE us?!
- What would make Liz so shy? I don't know this man. It's never too late...
-
- to give up. Just look at you!
- It's a beautiful day, and you're stitting inside watching television!
- And what's that junk you're snacking on?! Aren't you fat enough already?!
- And look now how CLOSE you're sitting to me! Are you TRYING to ruin your eyes?!
- And have you called your mother lately?!
- And have you brushed your teeth today?!...for TWO MINUTES?!!
- When did we get the nagging channel? I think it's part of the basic guilt package.
-
- Cat Ballet. * Meeeoooooooowwww...
- * Boobopdadeebopadoo *
- Cat jazz. Whine...
- What's the big deal? Rowrrr
- Unfriended by a squirrel. OW!
- Paper cut!
- Get it? Don't quit the day job. I was talking to Liz...
- She says that we need to start eating healthier.
- And you know what that means. Right. Start stockpiling donuts. The world will long remember me!
- They'll say ""What a great cat, that...uh...""
- ""...Garfield!"" Wha?!...
- Hello, I'm a frozen caveman from the last ice age.
- And now I'm all thawed out!
- So this is the modern world, huh? This is it.
- What's that? Modern man.
-
- Well, back to the glacier. Have a nice nap. I'm warming up...I'm warming up...
- ONE!!
- I'm cooling down...I'm cooling down... You should examine your life. Okay.
- Hmmm...
- I'm great! Dig a little deeper. Have you heard that dogs are man's best friend? Uh-huh.
-
- My owner is a moron. Small world. Here the lion attacks his prey. Just like me!
-
- Although I would have used some steak sauce. Sigh
- That was my sign of happiness!
- I wanted to make sure she didn't confuse it with some other sigh. Sigh.
- You have behaved yourself all day.
- The day is not over.
- sniff sniff
- sniff sniff
- sniff sniff
- sniff sniff
- sniff sniff
- If you grill it, they will come.
- Don't you have anything better to do?
- I am pleased to inform you that we do not. tic tic tic tic
- YES!
- You CAN bake apie inside a cake!
- Missed.
- It's Odie's birthday. I am King of the House!
-
- You can be prince. I broke a lamp today.
- I broke two saucers AND a vase!
- Awesome! We take a lot of pride in being cats. Do I enjoy engaging conversation, you ask?
- Do my elbows match?
- We may never know. Z
- GARFIELD! GARFIED!
- GARFIELD! COME QUICK!
- HURRY!! HURRY!!
-
-
- *I* happen to think rainbows are SPECIAL! So are my naps. I'm bored.
- Let's do something fun! Sorry.
- I'm committed to boredom. An exercise tip from Garfield the Cat...
- Before doing strenuous exercise, you must spend an appropriate amount of time stretching.
- I recommend eight to twelve hours. I'n on vacation.
- So I'm only being half as cute as usual.
- Still too much. I may look like a frog, but I', really an enchanted prince.
- He probably wants a kiss from the princess.
- You can break the spell by giving me your credit card number. Didn't see that coming. Everyone should be nice to animals. So true.
-
- Unless they taste good. Truer yet! Cat hair coming through!
-
- That had better not have been that spider. hee hee hee Sigh...
- This sure brings back memories, Garfield.
- I used to do this back on the farm when I was a boy.
- On summer nights, after my chores were done, I'd go out to the pasture...
- Lie on my back in the graff, and stare up at the stars...just like this.
-
- Boy, was that stupid. Cows are so uncivilized. I've eaten so much I can't move!
-
- Not that I wanted to. I won! I won!!
- I'm so excited!
- A two-week vacation at the beach! Not the brightest snowman. Ha! You and that teddy bear!
-
- I wish *I* had a teddy bear. Ha! It's the invasion of the Ravenous Beetles!
- But there's just one of you. What?!
- Come on, guys! You said you'd back me up! But we just ate. URP You go ahead. I'm here to bring joy into your life.
-
- Leaving already? I'm saving a little joy for myself. I bit my tongue today. Oh?
- Not on purpose, right?
- Riiiight? He wondered what it would taste like.
- Why so glum, Garfield?
- Look on the bright side...
- You have so much to be happy about!
- PLenty of food...
-
- Okay, that's about it. That's not a bad list. Let's start the week with an inspirational thought.
-
- DIE, MONDAY, DIE!!! I always try my best.
- That'll never work. You should try somebody else's best. Have you lost weight?
- You must be working out.
- You look so young! Beware of Insincere Dog Yeah, yeah, yeah... You're not half as great as you think you are.
- Whoa...
- That's still pretty good. How do I love thee?
- Let me count the ways..
- Pepperoni...sausage and onion...extra cheese... Another pizza poem? Thanks for watching. Why is he wearing pajamas?
- Good night.
- Z Ah. Let's see...
- What about my lime green corduroy blazer, canary yellow golf pants and cowboy boots? No.
- Or my blue serge dinner jacket with cargo shorts, black knee socks and sandals? No.
- Well, there IS my neon orange herringbone lederhosen with the bolo tie and wing tip shoes. NO.
- Jon, don't you have anything NICE to wear?
-
- ...Jon? Time to break out the LEISURE suit. I'll get the safety goggles. Time to celebrate! It's...
-
- National Scyscraper Day! Woo-hoo! Let's eat! Welcome to ""Garfield's Really Excellent Bedtime Stories"".
- ""Once upon a time...""
- Z Odie has dug a hole.
- It's a really good one, too.
- Right, Jon? A little help... Do you think everything has a purpose?
- Absolutely!
- Mine is to keep the donut population under control. It's friday! Let the fun begin!
- Who wants to hear a polka?!
- Let the fun end! ""To lose weight, you need to burn calories.""
- ""Walking a mile burns 100 calories. Swimming burns 500 calories an hour.""
- Lying there burns zero calories! How many calories can I burn by smacking you with a diet book?
-
-
-
-
-
- You don't waste a single ray, do you, Garfield? This takes a lot of effort.
- Well, not a LOT of effort.
- Just enough. Jon's yard work skills are iffy.
- RUNAWAY LAWN MOWER!
- Albeit entertaining. ""Dear Ask A Dog, how many different kinds of dogs are there?""
- bark bark
- Two. Good dogs and bad dogs. You shouldn't eat in bed.
- I wonder why not.
- Oh. Possibly because of the crumbs. You look really nice, Liz. Jon must really be in trouble.
- Is that a new hairstyle? Oh, BIG trouble.
- And have you lost weight? Leaving-the-country-and-changing-his-identity-trouble. If a cat lives in your house, you are very lucky.
-
- Even if you may not realize it. Jon? Hi, Liz.
- Jon, you look TERRIBLE! I know.
- I haven't been able to take a bath for three days.
- Why? Are you sick? No.
- Is it a plumbing problem?...did you forget to pay your water bill?
- Well, WHY, then?!
- Found it. You are watching the Drying Paint Network.
- Okay, let's give it a touch...
- Stillll a little wet. Oh, come ON! I like lasagna.
-
- Which has cheese in it. OOOOOO! BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!
- Not yet!
- Got a new sound effects guy. Ah. OW!
- I spilled coffee on my lap!
- Sugar? Suerly there's something better to do than staring off into space.
- Oh, there is!

- FWAFF
- Miiiiiiiiight be about time to put away the ol'pool. Time is running out, Garfield.
- Okay...
- What else is time going to do? I have a new philosophy, Garfield. And that would be?
- I'm going to live each day like it's my bithday. Why is that?
- That way we can eat more cake! Great stomachs think alike! Sigh. Tough day.
- How tough is it, you ask?
- Even my teddy bear needs a teddy bear. I...am...the...
- world's...fastest...
- Turtle? DON'T...RUSH!...ME!...
-
- Jon burned the hamburgers again. SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! There wasn't enough time in the day to get everything done.
- Sigh.
- Of course, I was only awake for 45 minutes.

- The only bad thing about a good night's sleep...
- It messes with a good day's sleep. It's a shame that you don't have anybody else to hang out with.
- What?
- No, he was talking to ME. BURP
- KICK!
- -and never stopped being cute! I hate you. Remember the time I said something funny? DO I?!
- WAH-HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
- No. ...and that's why you shouldn't flip pancakes too high.
- And you're telling me this why?
- Neve rmind. Liz said we need to eat more greens.
- No problem.
- And green sprinkles on donuts do not count. There went my loophole!
- GLOMP
- BURRRRRP
- FOOOOOOOOF
-
-
-
- Today is my lucky day!
-
- Unless it's tomorrow. It's tomorrow.
- BAKERY
- How can blueberry muffins be extinct? Why BURP ask me? Wow! Look at that, Odie! A falling star!
- Did you make a wish?
- So how was stargazing? Something seems odd.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm in a good mood! Sorry I'm late! Lazy me. I slept through yesterday.
-
- There was a yesterday? Pants are very expensive if you're a spider.
- But you don't wear pants.
- AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY!
-
-
-
-
-
- I am here. Feel free to squeal with glee and shed tears of happiness.
- YAWN!
- I'll come back after you've composed yourself. I like to watch the seasons change.
- From summer to autumn...
- Or as I prefer to call it, from ice cream to fresh baked cookies. We spend too much time staring at our phones. I'm putting mine down! That's niche.
-
- By holding perfectly still, I prevent my prey from seeing me.
- Hey! Look at that fat cat i the bushes over there!
- That wasn't my prey. Everybody ready for movie night?
- Tonight's film: ""Polka, Polka, Polka! The Untold History of the Accordion"".
- And-a-one, and-a-two... I wonder what's going on today?
- Ow!
- Besides having a sore neck.
- It's that time of year again...sweater weather.
-
-
-
-
- Turn up the heat! You should pattern your life after mine!
-
- See? It's not that hard. And now the conclusion of ""Dracula Versus a Truck!.
- Hey! You parked on my foot!
- But that doesn't bother me! Mwah-hahahahahaha! And here comes the sun. Nooo!
- It can't be!
- I've run out of moisturizer! The Mummy's Curse. Every day brings something new.
- I think the guy across the street is a zombie.
- And I wish I could cut it out. Brilliant!
- Dracula is powerless against it!
- Why didn't we think of this before?! Turtleneck sweaters? GLITCH! RATS!!
-
- You just can't carve a grape. click
- ** DING-DONG Coming!
- Yes?...
- SHRIEEEEEEK! Hi! You must be Sherri!
- YEEEEHHHH!! You sure look very pretty.
- YEEEEEEEEEK!!! What would you like to do this evening?
- You are watching ""Godzilla Goes On A Blind Date"". What say we step out on the town? He looks good in a suit. It's National Cat Day. It is?
- Whoa...
- I thought that was every day. Hey, nice costume, Goldy!
-
- GARFIELD!! Nobody here but us pumpkins. I am Zardog, Devourer of Worlds!
- I have come to eat your planet!
- What kind of dipping sauces do you have? Ooh! Pick honey mustard! I only want what's best for us, Garfield.
- Or second.best.
- Well, maybe third-best. You're getting warmer. Liz, if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?
- Seriously?
- I guess I should think of better questions. ""When do we eat?"" is a good question. Cats love to play with empty bags.
-
- And emptying them is half of the fun. **
- And now back to ""Dog Horror Theater"".
- Bye, Scruffy! See you tonight! SLAM!
- tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock
- tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock
- tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock
- HI. Scruffy! Bet you thought I'd NEVER get home! I should take a break from this.
-
- Except that I don't think there is one. I had a dream that martians were controlling me with a laser brain ray.
-
- Beep. All righty. My experiment has gone horribly wrong! I've turned into a FLY...
- A fly the size of a MAN!
- Now THERE'S some good eatin'! zzzz
- zzzzzzz
- You don't see a lot of bees wearing sweaters. Thanks. Enjoy.
- Oh, great! This pizza was supposed to be half-and-half!
- No big deal! I'll just pick the mouse heads off your side.
- What are YOU looking at?!
- Life would be easier to observe through a one-way window.
-
- Let me tell you about my day.
- Farfield, let's talk nutrition.
- BARK!
- And in the news today...
- You said it, Pooky. Happy monday!
- This is the best day ever!
- And, in case you missed it, this is called ""sarcasm"". I'm nice.
-
- Ask ALMOST anybody.
- You'll have to go without me.
- I just don't care for opera. I am ready for what lies ahead.
-
- Unless it comes from that direction.
- YAWN!
- Am I boring you? Yes, thank you. Garfield, it's saturday.
- Isn't it a little early for your monsay face?
- Just getting into character. SLAM!
- Hi, boy, am I stuffed! pat pat pat
- Say, which way to the kitchen? I've got me a date with an oven! Down the hall.
- Thanks, pal! I'll save you a leg!
- My annual turkey dream...
-
- Someone order a gravy boat, giblets, candied yams and apple pie? Just got even better. I made a list of chores.
- Eat the leftover pizza, finish the bag of chips, drink the last can of soda...
- Work! Work! Work! This article says that for good health...
- It's important to stay hydrated.
- That means you must have plenty of liquids. Does marinara sauce count? A new study says eating donuts will help you live to be a hundred!
- We need to eat more donuts!
- Amazing what you can do with a computer, newsprint and a big honking printer.
- BURP!
- Is lunch over? Halftime. Where's Garfield? He couldn't make it...
- So he sent me in his place to keep you company at dinner.
- And he wants me to bring the leftovers. Mister Romantic. You know, Garfield, OTHER cats scamper around and do funny things!
- Fine.
- You don't dare. Look, do you want comedy or don't you?
- Wow...what a great meal that was.
- Everything was delicious, Liz...
- Your mashed potatoes are even better than my Mom's!
-
- * beedle beedle beedle
- * beedle beedle beedle It's my mom. Uh-oh. She heard you. So much food is wasted.
- Simply thrown away.
- Thank you! ""Dear ask a dog...""
- ""Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!""
- Sorry, we don't speak goose. Are you warm enough, Pooky?
- Hang on.
- Is that my sweater? Not anymore. A hog weighs 700 pounds...
- A cow weighs 1,600 pounds...
- I wonder what YOU weigh. Shut up, or I'll sit on you. Remember, Garfield...
- People are nice to you...
- When YOU ar enice to THEM. There's always a catch! I've got it all.
-
- Although I'm not quite sure what it is. Good news, Odie!
- I found your missing bone!
- But I lost it again!
- But I found it again!
- Then I ran away and joined the circus.
- But I got homesick and came back!
- And Jon threw it away! SLAP! I can't decide what to do today.
- So maybe I just won't do anything.
- Sometimes the best course of action is to do nothing. You're preaching the choir, brother.
- SLAP! DOH!
- It's good that one of us is keeping an eye on the calendar. You know, Garfield, christmas isn't too far off.
- That can only mean on ething...
- Santa's spies are around. BANG! BANG! BANG! Arrgh! The nail's bent!
- BANG! BANG! BANG! Agghhh! Hole in the wall!
- Ow! Plaster in my eye! And thus we herald Jon't time-honored tradition of christmas decoration and home demolition. The tree is up!
- CRASH!!
- The tree is down. It's a cat thing. I hope that Santa brings me something wonderful.
- Like what? A new chain! I'll put in a good word for you. Soooooo...
- Need any suggestions for mi christmas present this year, Liz?
- Oh, I already finished all my christmas shopping last month.
- I've also wrapped everything, written and addressed all my christmas cards...
- AND picked out an outfit for new year's eve!
-
- How organized can you GET? She's taking the tree down. Dear Santa, I have been good. Please bring me lots of presents. Love, Garfield. type type type
-
- #GimmeGimmeGimme type type type Santa knows if you've been bad...he keeps a list, you know.
- Guess that leaves only one thing to do.
- Someone hacked your naughty folder. As christmas approaches...
- Make sure they know your size.
- An extra-extra-extra-extra-extra-extra gigundous pizza extremo supremo? You missed an ""extra"". One of the outside christmas bulbs burned out.
-
- They can see our house from the space station!
-
- Did you see my giant inflatable Santa? slosh slosh slosh slosh
- slosh slosh slosh slosh
- Somethings tells me we're out of eggnogg.
- I'm sorry I don't have anything to give you for christmas, Garfield.
- I actually DID gt you a big juicy rat...
- But I was really hungry, so I ate it myself.
- That's okay, Arlene. It's the thought that counts.
- * sigh
-
- Garfield's Christmas list:
-
- How's your printer ink supply? I'm not good at wrapping presents.
- Thank goodness.
- I was afraid that he WAS the present. And now back to ""The Christmas Miracle"".
-
- There's not one burned-out bulb on that ttree. That's the miracle. Christmas is almost here, and I've been good the entire month of december.
- I don't even know me anymore.
- I don't even LIKE me anymore. Spider Claus, they're calling for heavy FOG on Christmas eve. So I hear!
- Not a problem, though! Oh? Who will ride your sleigh?
- Rudolph, the red-nosed gnat! Is that you, Santa?
- Uh, no.
- Can there be more than one flying chubby guy?
- * owoooooooo
- * laaaaaaahhh
- * rowwwrrrrr
- * ROOORCH **
-
- * owooooolaaaaahrowrrr ** This year I'm FINALLY gonna catch Santa in the act!
- Thanks for the milk and cookies. Don't mention it.
- It's Christmas! Don't blink!
-
- You blinked.
- BURP!
- I STILL say you switched the tag on my cheese log. MY cheese log. Come on, Garfield. I just want to get a nice picture of the Christmas sweater my mom made for you.
- ...so SMILE.
- I AM smiling. I refuse to believe Christmas is really over.
- DRAG DRAG DRAG DRAG CLUNK
- SIGH Well, there it is. The last Christmas cookie.
- If we eat it, Christmas will really be over.
- In time, our hearts will mend. Okay, listen up...
- Liz and I are going out on New Year's eve, and I've decided NOT to get a pet sitter.
- I think you're both old enough and mature enough to handle being on your own now.
- And I know you'll behave yourselves and make me proud.
-
-
- I can see the future, and it's going to be wonderful..
- There will be peace, harmony...
- ...and lots of pie. Life has its ups and downs.
-
- This is an ""up"". ""Dear Ask A Dog, is a dog's bark worse than his bite?""
- Yip! Yip! Yip!
- Yes, but only if the dog wears dentures. tap tap tap BAM! OW! MY THUMB!
- tap tap tap BAM! OW! MY THUMB!
- I've decided not to hang that picture. Run out of thumbs? I admire people with integrity.
- Integrity? I have LOTS of integrity!
- Really? Yeah, I stole it off a guy.
- Don't even think about it.
- My face told on me. WAH! WUMP!
- WAH! WUMP!
- WAH! WUMP!
- WAH! WUMP!
- WAH! WUMP!
- WAH! WUMP! I guess I was wrong.
- I thought ice skating would be a fun date night. WAH! WUMP! I'm having a ball. Today's forecast...
- Boring, with a 50 percent chance of dull.
- Hi, Garfield. Make that 100 percent. Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah... Jon is telling me about his day.
- Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah... His boring, boring day.
- Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah... That just took an interesting turn! Grrrr. I hate cats!
- Cats drive me crazy!
- And you're really good at it! The pleasure is all mine. I don't have a problem in the world!
- Oh, wait...
- I was thinking of some other world. Then you should go there. Jon, please don't make a fuss over my birthday.
- Are you sure? Absolutely.
- I have to make a fuss over Liz's birthday. Absolutely. Come on down!
- Check out our new arrivals...
- ""Wet Dog"" and ""Possum Carcass""!
- Never buy scented candles at a pet store. Hmmm... I woonder...
- How do those dead flies get inside light fixtures? Uh-oh. Jon's wondering things again.
- Does it really help to press harder on the remote control buttons when the batteries are getting low?
- Could we talk faster if we had three lips? What does the inside of your nose smell like? Would milk taste different if cows ate hamburgers?...
- ARRRGHHH
-
- How DO those dead flies get inside light fixtures? Coming up, on Cliffhanger Theater...
-
- What are those mice doing in the living room?!
- I believe that's the hokey-pokey.
- Garfield... Hang on. Now they're doing a conga line.
- ZWIP
- Yeah, squirrels sire are mean, Odie. Help! This is way too much pizza for me to eat!
- I'LL save you! What good are you?! Why are you even here?!
- You're worthless!
- Yelling at empty trash cans again? I'm hungry! Sometimes I just can't stop smiling.
-
- I said, ""sometimes"".
-
-
-
-
-
- Was there a ""Supermoon"" tonight? Nope, Just a goofy one. I can't help but feel that I've forgotten something.
- Oh, yeah!
- Z I've been thinking about my life. What about it?
- What if things don't go wrong? Say what?
- I mean, success can be harder to deal with than failure. Just as long as there's pizza on the table... We'll be right back to our commercial...
- Right after this commercial.
- But first... Oh, come on! This cat food tastes sort of like chicken.
- How about that.
- It's made from sort-of chickens. Good news, bad news.
- My tires are okay.
- But my car went flat. Only you, Jon. I suppose you thought that looked stupid on me.
- It did.
- But Pooky can pull it off.
-
- SLAP!
-
- SLAP!
-
- BOOMP! BEWARE OF CAT
-
- At least until I've had my coffee. I slept...
- Then I ate.
- So, how was YOUR day? Would you like to fetch the stick, Garfield?
-
- Apparently not. Garfield, why is the kitchen filled with mice?
-
- Looks like they're having a lodge meeting. Is this the last chip? You saved me the last chip? Yup.
- munch munch mun
-
- It's stale. Duh. It took me an hour...
- But I finally got that jar of peanut butter open.
- The empty one? The empty one. Please swip your card

- I almost did something today. You got me beat. I shall now meditate and find my center.
- I sense that my center is empty.
- I shall now fill my center with a donut. Odie I swear you've grown a foot taller today!
-
-
- I wonder what would happen if I were allergic to cats.
- You'd have to move out. I read Shakespeare today.
- I read the washing instructions on my shirt today!
- Liz and I have been discussing literature. Your shirt shrank. I know where there's some cheese.
-
- You d amouse! It's what I do. Liz...
- Liz, I...I...I...I...
- You see, I, uhhhhhhhhhh... ummmmm...I...errrr...
- Well, it's just that I...uhhhhh...you know, ummmm...
- I love you too, Jon. *
-
- And I bet you thought I couldn't say it! I am my own boss.

- I gave myself the morning off. Cats are the smartest beings in the world.
-
- Not that the competition is all that tough. I sense the powers of darkness are gathering.
- Hey, Garfield, instead of a hamburger, how about a veggie burger?
- They're heeere. Our love is like a I'm stuck, Garfield.
-
- Our love is like a cheese doodle. I'm so tired I can't think straight.
- Oh, come on, Jon, don't be so hard to yourself.
- Maybe you're just dumb. pat pat
-
- Pooky never complains when I cheat.

- We now go to a live helicopter shot of the runaway snow saucer on the interstate 67... Cheese doodle? Get up, Garfield!
- You've got things to do!
- Oh, there's motivation for you. ""This is a story about a cat...""
- ""Who always gets...his...way"".
- How is this a fairy tale? Just read. How does Odie keep his brain sharp?
- munch munch munch
- By eating a crossword puzzle every day.

- And think and think and think... I'm going to read a book a day!
- Wow, this is long. Maybe a book a week.
- Oh, forget it. I'll go see a movie based on a book. Or just watch the trailer. ""Dear Ask a Dog, who's stronger? Cats or dogs?""
- HUHHHHHHHHHHHH
- Dogs, but only if you count their breath.
- SHOOP!
- Thought I heard a can opener. I'm a serious man, Liz.
- Your clown nose fell off.

- Can we expect you at six o'clock?""
- ""Signed, Mr. and Mrs. Frederick J. Flea"". Cats sense when something bad is going to happen.
- Know why?
- Because we're usually the cause of it. Liz, your eyes are lovely.
- Why, yes, they are lovely.
- Do you MIND?! And your eyes look a little grumpy. A word of advice, Garfield...
- Just because you see somebody do something in a movie...
- Doesn't mean YOU can do it. Why are you limping? Hmmm...
- What do you want to do today, Jon? How about something *I* want to do for a change?
- What do you mean? We ALWAYS do what you want to do.
- WE DO?! Well. we don't exactly do what I want to do.
- I THOUGHT THAt WAS BECAUSE YOU LOVEd ME!
-
- Have fun at the fabric store. Wake up, Garfield!
- This book has 1001 boredom busters! Poor Jon...
- Boredom Buster Number One... ""Make a dollhouse out of a shoebox""? He means well. He thought he was prett clever...
- Thought he could outsmart me. But I tracked him down.
- Back to the sock drawer, mister! ""Here Lies Jon Arbuckle: he was smarter than a sock"". I appreciate beauty.
- Ta-dah!
- Genuine beauty doesn't have to ""ta-dah!"" I heard that! It's warm out.

- I imagine...
- Why don't you open your eyes? Why chance it? I was on the debate team.
- I even won my first debate!
- Actually, my opponent forfeited when I started to cry. Pathetic, yet effective. You want me to throw the ball?
- Hang on.
- Okay, I'm ready. BEWARE OF CAT Whoa...
- Watch out, people.
- I might just criticize your wardrobe. Liz, your eyes are like...
- Um...like...like...
- Like round, squishy balls that you see through. And they say romance is dead. My uncle Iggy died.
- It was tragic.
- He ate so much cheese that he exploded. Hey, isn't that how we all want to go?
-
-
-
-
-
- All I did was ask him if he wanted to go for a ride in the car. How does he do that ceiling thing? I'm not always sarcastic.
-
- Sometimes I'm asleep. If I were an astronomer...
- I could discover a new planet. And they'd name it after me! ""Planet Dipward"". Odie is trying to be more like me. Z
- Z
- I'd lose the tail wag there, pal. Z
-
- My new place isn't quite finished. Ah. Where do chicken wings come from?
- The oven.
- Not chickens? Chickens have ovens? Nothing lasts forever.
- Diet cat food.
- It just seems that way.
- Come on, Garfield. Put a smile on your face! Sure...
- How about the salesman smile?
- The smug smile?
- The fake smile? Or the vicory smile!
- Stop smiling! I thought you'd never ask. I like to think I make the world a better place in which to...
- SNORE
- sleep. I've decided to give back to the world.
- But first...
- I'm going to take a bunch of stuff.
- LOOK, Odie!
- Here's when mom was on her knitting binge.
- She knitted sweaters for everyone in the family.
- And then for the chickens. The rhinestones are a bit much. For you, Liz, I would climb the highest mountain!
- Although that sounds scary...
- PLEAS DON'T MAKE ME! Oh, go ahead. BARK! BARK! BARK!
- You don't seem as tough with those glasses on.
- Oh, boo-hoo!! I'M SORRY!! Jon?--
- Jon, how do you feel about our relationship?
- I couldn't be happier, Liz. I must be the luckiest man on earth to have met someone as wonderful as you.
- In the time we've been together, I feel I've matured and grown...and you're the reason for it.
- Your love has made me a much, much better man, and I'm so very thankful that you're my girl.
- Jon, that's beautiful.
- And I want a bbig, fat doggie bag for this. AND I WANT A BIG, FAT DOGGIE BAG FOR THIS
- Is that coffee too strong?
- NO! The best things in life are free.
- And so are the worst things.
- It's the stuff in between that's expensive! ""Dear Ask A Dog""...

- Gravy can be classified as a beverage! YOWLLL!
- Do you think I have a good yowling voice? Lovely!
- ...and then I pretended to get a phone call. I was born to dance!
- No, you weren't.
- THEN WHAT'S WITH ALL THESE FEET?!
- Look, Garfield. Only one donut left.
- If you ate it, I'd feel sad because I didn't get any.
- If I ate it, I'd feel guilty because you didn't get any.
- So, consider this...
- If we shared it, I'd be happy that we both got some!
- It's always about you, isn't it? You have many faults, Garfield.
- And a donut.
- Is that all you can think about? AND a cup of coffee. Scientists made a discovery today...
- After exhaustive research on the effects of dog breath...
- They've found it to be an excellent paint remover. Finally, a use for dogs. I'm learning a second language.
- Meow meow meow meow meow meow
- How was that? You just asked for directions to the pipe wrench.
- Uh-oh. We lost power...
- For a second... Don't worry. I cleaned out the fridge so nothing would spoil I hurt my finger. I won't be able to play the accordion for weeks.
-
- And that's why hats make lousy cereal bowls. Okaaay...
- I'm starting all my conversations at the end now.
- It's a real time-saver. And a blessing. BARK! BARK!
- BARK! BARK! BARK! BARK!

- Break time. My uncle Clarence was a circus clown.
- He retired last year.

- Protecting us from bad bones.
- Hey...
- We're like before-and-after pictures. Shut up. Do you think I'd make a good cowboy?
- What if a horse steps on your foot? Oh...
- Well, do you think I'd make a good ballet dancer? Not with that limp. Eat healthy, people!
- And avoid snacks.
- Snacks are mine. Hey, Garfield!

-
- The fifth is profoundly ugly. *PING! *PING! *PING! *PING!
- GARFIELD!
- Would you stop posting those pictures?! Hey, that litter box isn't going to clean itself, pal. Dinner ideas? Let's see...

- ""Do you bite?"" Hmmm
- Bark? Bark? No, this letter is not from a steak.
- Let me guess...
- You want me to throw that stick, right?
- SWISH All right...fetch the stick, boy!
- Ha! I faked him out!
- How gullible can you get? Poor Odie. Poor, dumb Odie.
- GARFIELD The world is my oyster.
- No, that's not it...
- The world is my pizza! You know, Garfield, I'm a pretty lucky guy. Lucky, lucky, lucky. I have my health, a loving family, a good home...
- A decent car, impressive sock collection, a wonderful girlfriend, nifty cell phone, yep...
- I pretty much have everything. Except a mute button. Z a-HEM
- Oh, sorry.
- BARK BARK BARK BARK Good help is so hard to find. Cats are adorable.
- No?
- How about now? We should do something. You bet.
- But we won't. Becaaause?...
- We're cats. High five! My cookies are made with a secret ingredient.
- What is it?
- It's a SECRET, you dipwad! You don't mess with grandma.
- Hey, Garfield! Let's do something!
- We could take a walk!
- Fly a kite!
- Learn to knit! Plant a garden!
-
- Or you can ignore everything I say. Yeah, let's do that one. Sometimes in the morning...
- I like to go for a walk.
- Get off my face! On my way to breakfast.
- I am NOT cleaning that up!
- Yeah, I like it, too.
- kick
- Pavlov was right. Once I set my mind on something...
- Did you hear that?!
- Now, what was I talking about? Cheesecake. Arlene...
- Someday I'll take you away from all of this.
- But I like it here. Whew! I seriously doubt that Garfield is conspiring against you.
- Oh, good.

- Oh, my...
- This might be a good time to bribe me with some treats. We should join forces. To do what?
- Uh...
- Nothing? I'm in! There's a key to getting down from a tree.
- SNAP!
- It's called gravity. Liz, may I call you ""baby""?
- I'd rather you didn't. Oh.
- That goes double for me. Forgive and forget.

- ""If you're so smart, how come somebody has to read you the questions?""
- Grrr! That's a good one. My birthday is creeping up on me. I can feel it.
- Or, maybe I'm just being paranoid.
- How many of us birthday candles will you be needing on your cake this year? 41.

- We went out for a nice Italian dinner...
- And then to a veterinary lecture.
- It was titled ""Treatment of an Abscess.""

-
- Like, for instance, january. What worries you, Garfield? Oh, you know...

-
- You are really bad at this.

-
- I just haven't told my face yet. Aaahhh...

- The peace, the quiet, the warmth of the sun...
- But something's missing.
- I know...
- Friends to share it with! All is well in the world.
- MY world, that is.
- You're on your own. I've decided to improve myself.
- Kidding!
- How could that even be possible? There are many different kinds of dogs.
- There are dumb ones...and...
- Okay, there's one kind. I'm telling you, it'll never catch on.
-
- Cheese-flavored gum. Do you ever get the feeling nobody cares about you? Yes...
-
- And why am I asking you? Ask me if I care.
- We're out of tape.
- please stay away from the stapler! Handled. Excuse me...waiter?
- Waiter, my date went to the men's room, and he's been gone for half an hour...
- Can you please find out what's taking him so long? I'll check Ma'am.

- Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Eat somewhere besides the table.
- Bark. Dummy. My, what a lovely day!
-
- What else you got? Do you know what I want for my birthday, Garfield?
- To be nice to me?
- No. That's not it. Are you sure? I fear nothing.
- Except for the things on this list.
- I'm also afraid of the list. I hope I'm on it.
-
- Wow.

- I'm afraid I'll have to charge you for a canceled appointment! Liz, I have written a poem for you.
- ""Fifty pounds of bacon""?
- ""You are the air that I breathe""? This isn't my shopping list. Ugh.
- I don't feel so good.
- Probably something I DIDN'T eat.

- Supper's eaten!
- Wait! Supper's missing! Now you got it. Here's Odie, sacrificing his dignity to beg for food.
- Whine
- That works? My wife is making us go vegetarian.
- Last night, we had tofu fly.
- I'd swat you, but you've already suffered enough. You said it, bro. Garfield finds me fascinating.
- Sometimes he stares at me for hours. Really?
- Is that true? Did you know that I can sleep with my eyes open? Cat versus dog! The big battle!

- Then feed me!
- Seriously? ""Great"" is relative, you know. Why are the mice running laps in the kitchen?
- And washing my car? And doing jumping jack?
- And what happened to my six-pack of energy drinks? I think you solved the mystery, Sherlock. ""Dear Ask A Dog""...
- ""Why has a dog never walked on the moon?""
- Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! No trees. That's right! That's right!
- Who's the man? Who's the man?
- I'M the man! Finally connected all the dots on that coloring page. I think Liz is angry with me. Oh, Jon...
- You have such low self-esteem...you always fear the worst.
- She said, ""I'm angry with you"".
- That could mean anything! The first cup of coffee sets the tone for the whole day.
- SLURRRP
- How's the decaf?
-
- Uh-oh.
- FRIENDLY DOG!

- My first pet was a dinosaur.
- I love the Geezer Comedy Channel. My birth certificate is written in hieroglyphics. Uh-oh!
- ZING!
- Look, it's happening whether you like it or not! Me and the other candles wanted to give you a piece of birthday advice.
- And that advice is?
- Embrace the horror. This ist my best birthday ever!
