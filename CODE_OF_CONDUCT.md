# Code of Conduct

# Our Hope
We, the leaders, hope our community is a free experience for everyone,
regardless of whoever you are or however you think.

We act and interact in any way that make the community an actual community.

# Our Standards
We have very little standards. Just be human and respect human rights.
But to be nice, you can always follow those good examples in the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

# Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to when this project is related - for example, community spaces.

# Enforcement
If you think something violated this Code of Conduct, the case may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.
All complaints will be reviewed, investigated and fulfilled promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
(Obviously should not the violater. They will ~~be executed~~ get their consequences publicly.)

# Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines
in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

~~Cancel them. We shouldn't be a human to something that is not human.~~
Actually, read the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct for real advice.
