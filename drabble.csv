"- How long do we have to stay in the basement, Ralph? Until this Y2K thing blows over!
- Trust me, it's pandemonium out there. We might even be the last people on earth!
- Fortunately, I've stockpiled enough supplies to last us for a year!
- Dad, Norman ate all the 'Cheetos'! YOU ATE A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF 'CHEETOS' IN HALF AN HOUR? I had the munchies!",dr000101
"- The year 2000! I can't believe it!
- All my life, I've dreamed about what things would be like in the 21st century, and now I know! Dad...
- I MADE IT! RALPH DRABBLE HAS LIVED TO SEE THE NEW MILLENIUM!! Dad...
- Forgive me foe getting so emotional, boys, but this is the greatest experience of my life! Dad.
- What? My teacher says that the new millennium and the 21st century don't officially start until 2001!
-
- YOU MEAN I GOTTA STAY ALIVE FOR ANOTHER WHOLE YEAR??? Sorry. Better cut back on the donuts!",dr000102
"- In preparation for the Y2K disaster, I stored enough food down here to last an average family for one year.
- Unfortunately, Norman has already eaten all the 'Cheetos'...
- And I'm ashamed to admit that I just polished off the beef jerky and 'Pop Tards'!
- Ralph, what are you saying? For lunch tomorrow, we're going to have to eat the cat!",dr000103
"- As you know, the Y2K bug has thrown the world into chaos.
- Since I had the foresight to lead you all to the basement, we are probably the last people alive.
- Therefore, I think our first order of business is to appoint a supreme leader of planet earth. I believe the choice is clear...
- Congratulations, mom! I was talking about ME!!",dr000104
"- Dad, why do we have to stay down here? Trust me, it's bedlam out there!
- Madison Avenue has worked people into a frenzy over this Y2K thing. I think there's a lot of money to be made in frightening weak-minded people!
- So we'll stay her in the storm cellar until things blow over. I didn't even know we had a storm cellar!
- We didn't until I brought this official Y2K do-it-yourself storm cellar kit!",dr000105
"-
- Hey, the world didn't come to an end! in fact, everything looks pretty normal!
- I think we can all come out now, dad!
- Good! I was getting pretty gamy! We were only down there for six hours!",dr000106
"- Whoa! It's my arch enemy, the evil SOCKFOOT!

- I love doing crossword puzzles! How do you know?",dr000108
"-
- SLUG BUG! Ow!
- What did you hit me for?? I saw a bug car!
- It's a fun game, dad! Whenever you see a bug car, you have to slug the person next to you and say ""Slug Bug"" before he slugs YOU!
- That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Don't play childish games like that with me while I'm driving!!
- You're almost 20 years old! Mix in some maturity, for cryin' out loud!
- Good heavens! There's a time and a place for...
- SLUG BUG!",dr000109
"- 'bye, dad! Where do you think YOU'RE going?
- To the mall. Not until you put your cap on the right way!

"- Dad, I have exciting news!

- It means there is still a possibility that I could make ESPN's list of the greatest athletes of the 20th century!!

"- Ralph, you're going to spoil your dinner! How many pieces of can have you eaten?
- Only two or three! If you say two or three, that means nine or ten!
- That isn't true!
- Tho or three means seven or eight! FIVE OR SIX means nine or ten!",dr000203
"- Hello?
- Oh, hello, Norman!
- I know you too well. Only YOU would call me and then be too wimpy to say anything. Thanks for calling. Hang up the phone now.
- And then wipe that stupid look off your face!",dr000204
"- Wendy thinks I'm a wimp. I need to change her perception of me by doing something bold and daring.

- ""Slow dance""...""Sew pants""...""Go ants""...
- Huh? I'm trying to give you something that rhymes with ""no chance"".",dr000207
"- I have made the bold decision to give Wendy a Valentine's card!
- Are you going to sign it? Of course I'm going to sign it!
- Let's see, now...how should I sign a Valentine's card to the woman I love?
- Best regards, Norman J. Drabble. (The guy who sits next to you in world history) That ought to melt her heart!",dr000208
"- What's that??

- Happy ***** day to the woman I ****. I **** you more than *** *** and I am ***** to **** you *******!
- I edited out all the embarrassing parts! How wimpy can you get??",dr000209
"- Wendy thinks I'm a complete wimp.
- Won't she be surprised at the courage I display by giving her a box of candy for Valentine's day!
-
- Although, I suppose throwing it in her yard and running away isn't the most romantic approach!",dr000210
"- *Ahem* Wendy...as you know...uh...well...Valentine's day is coming up...so...uh...
- I was wondering...well...I mean...I was thinking...um...if you'd like to...uh...well...see...
- That is...if you're not busy...uh...well, maybe we could...you know...sort of...well...
- Maybe...you know...sort of...uh...errr... Back in 15 Minutes",dr000211
"- Norman, I'm going out on Valentine's day...

- I thought ducks were supposed to flee in terror when a dog comes running at them! That was running?",dr000213
"- You wanted some fatherly advice, son? Yes, dad...
- Wendy thinks I'm a wimp, and I don't know how to change her opinion of me.
- Son, my advice to you is to be bold! Don't be afraid to ask for a date! She may say no, but she can't call you a WIMP anymore!
- A LOSER, maybe, but not a WIMP! ""Loser"" would be an improvement!",dr000214
"- Wendy...will you...uh...what I'm trying to say is...will you...uh... SIGH
- Be bold, son!
- Will you marry me?
- MARRY you? I said BOLD, not INSANE!!!",dr000215
"- That's right, I just proposed marriage! Pretty bold and daring, isn't it?!
- I guess that blows your theory that I'm a wimp, doesn't it?!
- So what do you say, Wendy? Yes or no??
- Yes. HA! I knew you'd say no because you...WHAT??!!",dr000216
"- Did you just accept my marriage proposal??? On the condition that we elope to Las Vegas immediately!
- Why???? Because I know you'll wimp out! The only question is how long it will take you!
- Let's go! I'm betting you'll wimp out before we even get in the car! Well, you're wrong!
- I refuse to wimp-out until we're at least out of the parking garage!",dr000217
"- I can't believe you want to marry me! I DON'T want to marry you.
- The only reason I accepted your marriage proposal was to call your bluff!
- I have no doubt that you'll wimp out before we get to Las Vegas!
- Three things in life a certain: death, taxes, and Norman Drabble will wimp out! That's it! I could fake my own death!",dr000218
"- Hello? ...oh, hi, Norm! Where are you?
- BARSTOW?? What are you doing in Barstow??
- ...you're on your way to Las Vegas to get married? Wow, congratulations!
- I gotta go, Norm. Your mom just fainted. Drop a nickel in the slot machine for me, OK?",dr000219
"- Good morning, Nor...
- DO NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD!!!
- I crammed all night for today's exam, and my brain is now filled to capacity!
- I cannot squeeze another bit of information into my head!
- If one more thought enters my mind, it will displace something that's already in there!
- I took a bubble bath last night. Rats! There went the Kansas-Nebraska Act!",dr000220
"- My fiancee and I would each like a chocolate shake, please!
- Oh, you're engaged? We're on our way to Las Vegas to get married!
- Not really. I only accepted his proposal because I know he'll wimp out, thus proving once and for all that he's the biggest wimp on the face of the earth!
- Whatever! Do you mind if my pet duck comes to live with us, darling?",dr000221
"- Norman, we're about to cross the Nevada state line. Don't you feel the slightest urge to wimp out, yet? Nope.
- I fact, I've been thinking...after we get married, we're going to need a place to live.
- Can we move in with YOUR parents?
- I don't think you'd like living with mine, on account of my dad likes to walk around in the house in his underwear! As soon as you feel like wimping out, go for it!",dr000222
"- I can't believe we're in Las Vegas. And there's a wedding chapel!
- The ""Burnin' Love Marriage Chapel""! Marriages performed by an authentic Elvis impersonator! Come on, let's go!
- Hi! _If we pay you in cash, will you marry us right now? Uh-huh!
- Right this way, y'all! I'm impressed, Norman. You're obviously going to wait until the last second to wimp out!",dr000223
"- Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Oh, sure.
- And do you, Norman, take this woman... Norman, it's OK to wimp out, now! You've proven your point!
- To be your lawfully wedded wife? I promise never to call you a wimp again! You da'man! Now call it off and let's go home!
- I do. I now pronounce y'all husband and wife! AAAUUGH!!",dr000224
"- You may kiss the bride. NO, HE MAYN'T!! I ""mayn't""?
- This can't be happening! Please tell me I didn't just marry Norman Drabble! Please, please tell me we're not married!!
- Y'all are married! Have a nice day, now!
- I WANT A DIVORCE!! What, and throw away the best 20 seconds of our lives??",dr000225
"- I can't believe we got MARRIED!! How are we going to get out of this??
- Wendy, Wendy, Wendy...relax! There's a simple explanation for all of this! Isn't it obvious? This is all a...

"- Every golfer needs a good caddie.
- A good caddie knows the game of golf forwards and backwards.
- A good caddie knows what the golfer wants almost instinctively! They are one of mind.
- Give me a sand wedge, Norm.
- Right!
-
- ?
- Is ham and cheese OK? ...Sigh...",dr000227
"- Rats! I'm down 35 cents! Sorry, Wendy. This isn't a good day to begin marriage!
- Cocktails! Cocktails! Would you care for a cocktail, ma'am?
- BUZZ OFF, BLONDIE! I'VE GOT A LOT ON MY MIND!!
- I apologize for my wife. She's a bit uptight because we just accidentally got married! His wife! Happens all the time!",dr000228
"- I can't believe we got married! Why didn't you wimp out like you were supposed to do?? Wendy, one day, I'm sure we'll look back on this and laugh!
- Ladies and gentlemen...I've been told we have newlyweds dining with us tonight...
- Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Drabble!
- Sorry to make a scene, but that pushed me over the edge. I sure hope this town has an accordeon repairman!",dr000229
"- This is a nightmare! By a cruel twist of fate, I find myself in Las Vegas, married to Norman Drabble!
- Maybe if I remain calm, I'll be able to think of a reasonable solution to all this.
- I've got it!
- Where are you going? The MIRAGE to throw myself into a volcano!",dr000301
"- I can't believe I'm married to Norman Drabble. My worst nightmare has become a reality. My life is ruined.
- Maybe it's not so bad. Maybe I could make it work...
- Maybe it won't be so horrible being married to Norman.
- Wendy, guess what! This hotel has an arcade! I think I'll go back to the wedding chapel and plead insanity!",dr000302
"- Hello...you've got to help us! We got married here earlier today, and... You did? Why don't I recognize you?
- We were married by a different Elvis impersonator. Oh, no...
- Weldon, did you... I'm sorry, daddy,,,they wanted to get hitched right away, and you were at lunch, so I...
- Folks, Weldon, here, is not an ordained Elvis impersonator. I'm afraid you're not legally married! So, should we do it over? NO!",dr000303
"- What a relief not to be married to you!
- I feel like I've been granted a REPRIEVE! I will never again take for granted a moment of my life that I am unmarried with you!
- Thank you for messing everything up, Norman!
- You've made me the happiest woman in the world! I should've married you sooner!",dr000304
"- Look what I've got, Oogie! The laser pointer!
- What's that?! It's a bug!!
- Whoa!
- It's alive!!
- Where'd it go? click!
- There it is! Go get it!! scramble scramble scramble
- It's amazing how such a simple thing can occupy that tiny mind for hours!
- I guess cats are pretty stupid. I was talking about your father!",dr000305
"- I love this game show! Contestants, put these donuts in order of size, starting with the smallest: A: Long John B: Plain C: Donut Hole D: Twist
- The correct order is: C.B.D.A! And the winner is...
- RALPH DRABBLE!!
- YAY, DAD!! I love you, Regis. Put me down!",dr000306
"- Ralph, here's your first question for $100...Humpty Dumpty sat on what? A: Roof B: Wall C: Tack D: Whoopee Cushion
- Hm...history isn't my best subject, Regis!
- I think I'll use my ""50:50"" lifeline. In the first question?? All right, take away two answers, please!
- Ralph, the correct answer is either ""wall"" or ""whoopee cushion"". Darn! Those were the two I couldn't decide between!",dr000307
"- I think I'd like to poll the audience, Regis! You want to use your SECOND LIFELINE on your FIRST QUESTION??
- OK, audience, Ralph needs your help. Did Humpty Dumpty sit on (B.) a wall, or (D.) a whoopee cushion? Please vote now!
- The results are in, Ralph. 100% of the audience says the correct answer is ""B"".
- This audience looks pretty stupid tome, Regis. I think I'd like to use another lifeline!",dr000308
"- Regis, I think I need to use my last lifeline!
- You're going to use up all your lifelines on the FIRST QUESTION?? This is highly unusual, Ralph!
- I know, but I think I'll call my young son, Patrick. He's a lot smarter than I am! Then again, who isn't? MOM, YOU NEED TO GET OFF THE PHONE FOR A FEW MINUTES!",dr000309
"- Patrick, we've got 30 seconds! Humpty Dumpty sat on what? A wall or a woopee cushion?? Before I give you the answer, dad, how much of the money will I get?
- Money?? Oh...uh...OK, I'll give you ten percent! No deal. We split it fifty-fifty! Take it or leave it!
- ALL RIGTH!! FIFTY-FIFTY!! NOW WHAT'S THE ANSWER?? Just kidding! The correct answer is...
- BZZZT!! Sorry, Ralph. You ran out of time! AAUGGH! Boy, are you gonna be in trouble!",dr000310
"- Ralph, you've used up all three of your lifelines, and you still haven't answered the FIRST QUESTION!
- I know, Regis, and I think I'm going to quit now and walk away!
- Walk away?? But you haven't won any money yet!! I think it's better to quit now than to risk the indignity of losing on the first question.
- Besides, that pulsating background music is giving me a headache! click",dr000311
"- Boy, am I exhausted! Why?
- Because daddy had a hard day at work, Penny! Why?
- Things were hectic! Why?
- You know, Penny...daddy doesn't like it when you ask ""why"" all the time! Why?
- Well, because it's not necessary for me to explain everything! Why?
- Because little kids don't need to know everything that's going on! Why?
- Because some things don't concern you! Why?
- Mommy, I need help in here! Why?",dr000312
"-
-
-
- I thought you said this was ""Pajama Day"" My mistake!",dr000313
"- All right, Patrick...suppose you're playing catcher, and the runner tries to steal...
- You spring to your feet and...
- Whoa!
- ...get real dizzy! I guess this explains why there aren't many middle-aged catchers.",dr000314
"- I hate to tell you this, Wally, but you have an appointment with the vet. !

- It's no use trying to flee.
- Especially in your case! skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle",dr000315
"- Wally! You're back from the vet! That wasn't so bad, was it?
- If you ask me, that vet was a little pushy!",dr000316
"- Crime, greed, assault, murder and mayhem! That's all they talk about anymore!
- It makes me depressed!
- If it depresses you so much, why do you watch the news??
- This is the SPORTS REPORT!!",dr000317
"- Wendy says that I'm easy to ignore.
- She says that's why nobody ever pays attention to me.
- Do you think I'm easy to ignore, dad?
- Dad?",dr000318
"- My wife is talking about something, but I have no idea what.
- That's because I tuned out a while back. The trick is to make it look like I'm still listening.
- There are several methods...for example, if she smiles, I smile!
- If she frowns, I frown.
- Stroking my chin while staring into space gives the impression that I'm pondering her words.
- A few non-committal verbal reactions are also helpful. Is that right? You don't say! Uh-huh...
- Finally good eye contact is a must!
- The key to a successful relationship is to always act like you're paying attention!",dr000319
"- Ralph, how would you like to go to a dinner party at the Smiths' on Friday night?
- I'd hat it. It's that last thing on earth I'd want to do.
- I'd rather be tied to an ant hill naked. Let me rephrase the question.
- We're going to the Smiths' dinner party on Friday night! I hate it when she rephrases the question.",dr000320
"- Ralph, why don't you want to go th the Smiths' party?? I hate parties, honeybunch!
- I'm just not a ""people person"".
- That's all right...
- None of them are ""grunt-head persons"", so you'll all be even!",dr000321
"- Honeybunch, you'd better call the Smiths and tell them I probably won't be able to attend their dinner party! Why?
- I think I might be coming down with something! Like what?
- Well, let's see...today is Wednesday morning...the party is Friday night...
- Hopefully, it's a case of the 72-hour flu!",dr000322
"- Drabble! What are YOU doing here??
- I heard you had a bad case of the flu, Steinbauer, so I rushed right over! Why??
- Because my wife is making me go to some dumb party on Friday, and I'm hoping I'll get sick so I won't have to go!
- Feel free to sneeze in my direction!",dr000323
"- All right, Ralph, you win! I guess you can't go to the party if you can't even get out of bed! I'll go by myself!
- SLAM!
-
- Just as I suspected. Get your clothes and let's go!",dr000324
"- I must admit, honeybunch, I actually had a good time at the party tonight!
- I can't believe you tried to catch a cold in order to avoid going!
- Heh! Heh! Thank goodness it didn't work!
- ASHOO! I'll go plug in the humidifier!",dr000325
"- I think I'll take a few laps around the track!
- Hello! Hello!
-
- Hello, again! Hello, again!

- Cough! Cough! Cough! Cough!
- There ought to be a rule that everyone jogging around a track has to go in the same direction!",dr000326
"- Rock music...rock music...rock music...who changed all my radio buttons?? punch punch punch
- I did, dad! When did you do that?
- This morning when I drove to the cleaners!
- You reprogrammed my radio buttons for a THREE-MILE DRIVE?? I almost got the car painted, but it was too expensive.",dr000327
"- Come on, Patrick...burn a fastball in here!
- Here we go...show me some heat, baby!
- WHOA!!
- My shins just flashed before my eyes!",dr000328
"- Hi, Wendy!
- Wendy?? Huh??
- Oh, sorry, Norman! I didn't mean to ignore you!
- It's just that you're so highly ignorable!",dr000329
"- Before I putt, I need to remove the pin.
- putt!
- Yes!! What a putt! It stopped only an inch past the hole!!

- Why did you bring your own chair? I don't want to sit in seats that a bunch of sick people have sat in!",dr000530
"- Having an aquarium in a doctor's waiting room is a good idea.

- And DAD is driving the carpool! I hope everyone likes the GOLDEN OLDIES station!",dr000606
"- Dad is driving the carpool today, and I'm afraid he's going to embarrass me.
- He'll probably try to be funny, and my friends will just think he's weird.

- Who wants to hear my Daffy Duck impression? This is going to be the longest three miles of my life!",dr000607
"- Mom, why did you let dad drive the carpool?!
- He embarrassed me infront of my peers!
- Son, it's a father's sacred duty to embarrass his children. One day, you'll embarrass YOUR children, and the circle of life will be complete!
- Why did you have to tell everyone I like the Teletubbies? What's wrong with the Teletubbies?",dr000608

- YOU'RE MY DENTIST!!
- I've been a patient of yours for 20 YEARS!! Gee, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!
- I can't believe it! I just ran into my own dentist, and he didn't even RECOGNIZE me!

- CRUNCH!!
- Do we have any more potato chips? I hope not.",dr000612

- Your sandwich isn't going to run away! Don't inhale it! You're liable to choke to death!

- Honeybunch, telling me how to eat is like telling Sammy Sosa how to hit home runs!",dr000613

"- Ralph, calm down and tell me why you're so angry at Mr. Steinbauer!
- He umpired Patrick's little league game, and called him out at first when he was clearly safe!
- Actually, dad, I looked out to me, too! I had a better view of it, son.
- Better view?? You were in line at the snack bar! YOU CAN SEE A LOT FROM THE SNACK BAR!!",dr000617
"- Happy father's day, dad!!
- What the heck is this? It's a utility belt for fathers!
- It holds everything a dad ever needs...
- Like holsters for each of your TV clickers! Wow! You'll never lose them again!
- And over here is your own personal ice cream scooper! Crackers and a can of aerosol cheese!
- And this is your money changer! You'll always have the exact change! Cool!

- melt my spatula!",dr000621
"- Sorry, Ralph...when I saw all the smoke, I thought you needed to be rescued!
- YOU rescue ME?? I can't imagine anything more humiliating than having my life saved by you, Steinbauer!

- You MUST be choking! I've never heard you keep quiet for so long!",dr000623
"- You're choking on your Hot Dog, Ralph? That'll teach you not to eat so fast! aakk!
- Stand still and I'll give you the Heimlich maneuver!
- All I have to do is wrap my arms around your stomach and...whoa, that's a long way around, isn't it?

- ...considering I saved your life and all! SEE?",dr000628
"- Local resident G.W. Steinbauer is a hero tonight, after saving the life of his neighbor, Ralph Drabble, who was choking on a hot dog.

- And now for some mouth-to-mouth resuscitation... AAAAAHHH!!",dr000708
"- Look at the flock of birds, Ralph! Isn't it amazing?
- Look at how they all fly in formation, and then suddenly, at the exact same moment, they all turn in a different direction!
- How do they know to do that at precisely the same time?
- It must be instinct. Yeah, like our kids.

- I wanted to save Steinbauer's life so we'd be even. Instead, he saved MY life again!

"- Why do men like to barbecue?
- Cooking meat outdoors over an open fire satisfies a primitive urge in males.
- It's obviously a throwback to when we were cavemen!
- Thank you for that scientific explanation! Later I'll explain why we like to walk around the house in our underwear.",dr000713

- When cooking meat outdoors over an open fire, I feel a special kinship with my primitive ancestors!
- Primitive ancestors?
- You mean, like uncle Larry? No, even more primitive than that. Not much, though!",dr000714

"- Timmy, when you step into the batter's box, what's the first thing you should do?

- This will intimidate the pitcher and give you a psychological edge! It will also give me a fastball in the rib cage!",dr000810
"- We will now discuss the fine art of changing the mound.
- Changing the mound?? Yeah, say the pitcher throws one high and tight...

"- Dad, how would you describe this glass of water?
- Half empty. I KNEW you'd say that!

- Now I say that it's totally empty!",dr001104
"- I think youth sports would be better if the parents stayed home.

- Norm, when a comic strip is all black and all you see are the characters' eyeballs, it's a safe bet that the cartoonist is sick with a flu!
- Really?? It's a trade secret, so keep it under your hat!",dr010206
"- I don't understand, dad...if a comic strip is in total darkness, why does it mean the cartoonist has the flu? Because he's too sick to draw!
- Imagine being a cartoonist...you have the flu, and you can barely hold a pen, but you have a family to support...
- So, with your last ounce of strength, you put characters in darkness so you'll only have to draw their eyeballs!
- Gosh, I've never felt sorry for a cartoonist before! Hey, I feel so sorry for him, I'm going to close my eyes for a while!",dr010207
"- Dad, are you suggesting that the reason it's dark in here is because the cartoonist has the flu and he's too sick to draw??
- Norm, all I'm saying is, I'm not buying the ""power outage"" theory.
- Why not?
- For one thing, it's only 10:30 in the morning!",dr010208
"- Dad, how long are we going to have to sit in the dark? Until the cartoonist gets over the flu, and can draw again!

"- Your honor, Mr. Steinbauer took advantage of me while I was in a decreased mental state!
- In the frenzied confusion of a garage sale, he got me to sell him my favorite painting for only $10.
- The fact that it subsequently appraised for $750,000 is irrelevant! I only want it back because it is a portrait of my dear and beloved aunt Edna!
- Ethel! Whatever!",dr010523
"- I've heard both sides of this case,and I've reached a decision...judgment for the plaintiff!

"- Welcome to the antiques appraisal show, Mr. Drabble! Tell us what you have!
- This is a painting by the renowned artist, Salvador Heyman! It was appraised here last week for $750,000!
- I just brought it back to see how much its value has increased since then!
- Mr. Drabble, I think you'd better sit down... Oh, boy! This is gonna be good! I'm in the money...",dr010525
"- Bad news, Mr. Drabble...this painting is not by the great Salvador Heyman, it's by SALVATORRE Heyman, who painted by numbers! WHAT?
- Last, week, one of your appraisers said it was worth $750,000! He's no longer with us!
- You mean it's WORTHLESS??! OH, I wouldn't say that...
- The frame is probably worth a buck or two! AAAAAHHH!!",dr010526

- But by the time I went back outside, the rain had stopped again, so I...
- NORMAN, RUN!

- Why didn't I think of that twenty minutes ago?",dr020505
"- ...OK, mom! 'bye!
- Ralph, guess what! My mother is going on a cruise to Mexico! Great.
- She'll be gone for a week! Good for her.
- and we're going to baby-sit her little dog, Gig! WHAT WAS THAT LAST PART??!!!",dr020506
"- While my mother takes a week-long cruise, we're going to babysit her dog, Gigi!
- No way! That dog is spoiled rotten! I will not have that yappy little dog in my house for a week!
- I'm putting my foot down!
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Every time I put my foot down, somebody steps on it! hop hop hop",dr020507
"- My mother brought over everything we'll need to take care of her dog, Gigi!
- Gig's bed, her special food, her blanket, her pillow, toys, sweater, shampoo, medicine, hair bows, nail polish...
- And a video of mother saying good night that I'll play when Gig goes to sleep.
- Did she happen to send an airsick bag for me? Oh, hush!",dr020508
"- Come on out, Gigi! This will be your home for the next week!
- whimper whimper whimper
- Oh, poor Gigi! Why are you so upset? whimper whimper
- Maybe she just saw herself in a mirror! Poor baby!",dr020509
"- Ralph, we're only watching my mother's dog Gigi for a week!
- Why are you so bent out of shape about it? It's not just me, honeybunch!
- Our other pets are pretty upset about it, too!
- Poor Wally's been trying to run away for an hour! skattle skattle skattle",dr020510
"- Hello? ...oh, hi!
- It's our mother calling from the cruise ship!
- ...Gigi? Don't worry about Gigi! We've got a search party scouring the neighborhood, and there's at least two hours of daylight left!
- GIVE ME THAT PHONE! If worse comes to worst, I'll post a reward!",dr020511
"- Here's your breakfast, Ralph.
- Thanks, honeybunch!
- Happy mother's day!
- PPPPFFFFF
- The holidays can sneak up on you, huh, dad? I'll be back in about an hour! I'll try to act surprised.",dr020512
"- Oogie, I owe you an apology.
- Over the years, I've made disparaging remarks about you, and I was wrong.
- Since we've been taking care of Gigi, I've come to realize what a pleasure you are! pant pant pant After Gig's 8:00 bubble bath, she gets warm milk and a cookie! claw claw claw",dr020513
"- What's cooking, honeybunch? Filet mignon.
- Mmm-MMM! It's not for you, it's for Gig. She has it every Tuesday.
- You get the leftover meatloaf!
- Ralph! Stop begging!",dr020514
"- Oh, dear! Poor Gig is upset again! pant pant pant Gasp! Gigi's upset?? Heavens to betsy! What could be wrong?? Was her filet mignon not tender enough??
- Did we not fluff her pillow properly? Was her bath water not tepid enough? Patrick, call 9-1-1.
- For a DOG?? No, for your dad. Is our mattress too firm??",dr020515
"- The VET?? Why do we need to take Gigi to the VET??!
- Because she seems upset! Mother said to take Gigi to the vet if we ever suspect anything is wrong! pant pant pant
- We're taking her to the vet because she seems UPSET??
- In that case, I must be a case for the E.R. Don't forget your wallet! pant pant pant",dr020516
"- We're back from the vet! pant pant pant
- He said the reason Gig has been acting upset is because she's in unfamiliar surroundings. pant pant pant pant
- He prescribed a tranquilizer and said that it should calm things down around here. pant pant pant
- Z So far, so good! pant pant pant",dr020517
"- Ralph, my mother returns from her vacation today! Is she going to pick up Gigi?
- Yes, so go get Gigi ready to go! With pleasure!

- Hang on, here's Gigi...
- pant pant pant pant",dr020520
"- Steinbauer! You've got to help me find my mother-in-law's dog, GIGI1 Huh?
- We've been watching Gigi while she went on a cruise! She's coming back TODAY!!
- My mother-in-law treats that dog like a queen! Her world revolves around Gigi! If Gigi is gone, I'm a dead man! Gee, Ralph. That's too bad.
- So, forgive me for laughing: WOO HOO HEE HEE HOO HA! Thanks for feeling my pain!",dr020521
"- GIGI! OH. GIGI!! You should offer a reward, Ralph.
- That's not a bad idea! I'll offer $10! $10? Who's going to help you for $10?? Make it $100!
- $100?? No way! That dog has already cost me a fortune in vet bills and filet mignon!
- Ralph, you have one hour to find Gigi, OR ELSE! ...on the other hand, $100 sounds reasonable!",dr020522
"- Tell me, Ralph, is it $100 for the dog's return, or $100 for information?
- For example, if you paid me $100 for information, and then I happened to find the dog, would you pay me ANOTHER $100?
- Steinbauer, if I didn't know better, I'd think that you...
- Excuse me. I need to check my barbecue! IS THAT FILET MIGNON I SMELL??",dr020523
"- Steinbauer, I believe you have information regarding the whereabouts of GIGI!
- And I believe you're offering a reward for such information.
- I'm not giving you any money! You're the one who told me to offer the reward in the FIRST PLACE!!
- Uh-oh! Is that your mother-in-law's taxi I see? Tens and twenties OK?",dr020524
"- All right, Steinbauer, you win! I'm a desperate man!
- Here's the reward money!
- NOW TELL ME WHERE GIGI IS!!
- Right behind you! Silly Gigi! She was under the bed the whole time! pant pant pant",dr020525
"- May I take your order, please? Yes, we'd like one double-cheeseburger and two single cheeseburgers...
- Hold the pickles and onions on one of the single cheeseburgers and put the extra pickle on the double cheeseburger! Uhhh.
- We also want one crispy chicken combo meal, but substitute onion rings for the fries and a chocolate shake for the soda. Uhh. OK, um...wait
- Then we need one small root beer, one small lemonade, and a medium orange soda with a dish of Dr. Pepper's. Put the two small drinks in medium cups because they fit better in the cup holders! Got all that?
- Hello?
-
- This isn't the first time mom has sent a drive-thru clerk running for cover. I didn't even get to tell him I have coupons!",dr020526
"- Ahhhh...
- There's nothing more relaxing after a hard day's work than sitting in the spa!
- BiBuBiBuBiBuBiBu Can't you guys make the bubbles any bigger? Maybe you should save your money and buy a REAL spa!",dr020527

- YEEEOOWW!
- No, I lost a staple, and I needed you to find it before anyone got hurt!",dr020530
"- flip flip flip YIKES!! TURN THAT OFF!!
- I can't bear to watch those closeup surgical procedures!!
- This isn't the surgery channel, it's the cooking channel!
- They're just stuffing a turkey. I wondered why the doctor looked like Emeril! Bam!",dr020531
"- I'm back from the video store!
- Did you rent ""Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein""??
- No, I rented ""Sense and Sensibility""
- I hate it when mom goes to the video store! I'll watch SENSE but not SENSIBILITY.",dr020601
"- ...and the Gilligan said to the professor...
- NORMAN, RUN!
- Nah-ahh! You just want me to run away and leave you alone!
- I'm finally wise to that little game, and I won't fall for it anymore!
- Whenever I start to bore you, you shout ""run"" so I'll panic and flee!
- Do you really think that I'm stupid enough to fall for the same trick over and over and over and...
-
- A delayed reaction is better than nothing.",dr020602
"- Hello, you sweet kitty!
- Mommy loves you!
- Why is it that you seem to like that cat more than you like me??
- For one thing, the cat cat doesn't shed as much!",dr020603
"- This golf ball is the property of Ralph Drabble.
- If found, please call 555.6771.
- You don't have a lot of confidence in your tee shots these days, do you, dad? Maybe I should include my area code!",dr020604
"- Hey, there's my ball!
- I thought you sliced it way out into the woods! Nope! That is definitely my ball!
- It should be easy to tell. You always write your name on it!
- This ball says ""Bob"". Who are you going to believe, me or a ball?",dr020605
"- Lounging on the couch, watching TV!
- How could you be lazier?? I can't find the remote...
- Will you feel around underneath me and see if I'm lying on it? I had to ask.",dr020606
"- You need to put your dog on a leash, Steinbauer!
- It's rude to let him run all over the neighborhood!
- You never put YOUR dog on a leash!
- Wally doesn't need a leash! skattle skattle skattle skattle",dr020607
"- Honeybunch, I'm starving!
- I've eaten nothing all day! NOTHING??
- Nothing except for a Granola bar...
- ...and a double chili cheeseburger! For you, that's nothing.",dr020608
"- We're off the zoo!
- Whoops, I forgot my keys!
- Oh, there they are!
- Hey, where's my wallet?
- Whoa! Why did I come back in here?
- Oh, yeah, I forgot my wallet!
- No, it's in my pocket!
- Did I lock the door? Wha ton earth is he doing? I call it the ""midlife mambo"".",dr020609
"- Excuse me, sir. Are you officer Dabble?
- Uh-huh. Mall cop first class Chambers reporting for duty, sir!
- A new recruit! Welcome aboard, rookie!
- Don't worry, I'll whip you into shape in no time! Here, have a corn dog!",dr020610
"- Excuse me, officer...can you tell me where the restroom is?
- Certainly, ma'am. It's halfway down the corridor, second door on your left. Thank you.
- No no no, Chambers...that's not the way a seasoned mall cop answers a question like that!
- The correct response is: ""What do I look like, a directory?"" Repeat after me...",dr020611
"- Chambers the key to being a successful mall cop is FOCUS!
- Never lose your focus, because...
- Care to sample our teriyaki chicken? Don't mind if I do!
- What was I talking about? I forget.",dr020612
"- Chambers, from 2:00 to 3:00, we're on escalator duty. Escalator duty?
- We ride the escalators up and down to make sure everything is OK!
- What could be lazier than standing on an escalator for an hour?
- Oh.",dr020613
"- Chambers, the food court vendors like to have mall cops around. They like the sense of security!
- Watch and I'll show you a little trick of the trade...
- WELL, I THINK WE'LL MOSEY ON OVER TO MACY'S NOW!
- You boys care for some pizza? How about some ice cream? Sweet, isn't it?",dr020614
"- It's been a rewarding week, No-Neck...
- I took a raw recruit and shaped him into a real mall cop.
- Isn't that right, Chambers? *urp*",dr020615
"- I can't wait to try out my new driver!
- The ""BIG BUBBA""! It's guaranteed to ad ten to twenty yards on your tee shot!
- Watch this...
- WHOP!
- Wow, dad! I can really see the difference!
- Instead of just hitting it out-of-bounds like you usually do, you hit it over the fence and into the parking lot!",dr020616
"- Son, don't feel bad because a girl turned you down for a date. Most girls would love to go out with a smart, handsome boy like you!
- Well, maybe ""smart"" and ""handsome"" aren't the right words...
- But I'll bet there are lots of girls who would love to go out with a guy like you!
- Well, maybe not ""lots"" Don't always fell like you need to be there for me, dad!",dr020617
"- Norman! Don't chew with your mouth open!
- That's not the proper way to eat!
- Give Norman a break, daddy!
- He hasn't had as much EATING EXPERIENCE as you! Who has?",dr020618
"- Hello, Mr. Drabble...and I wanted you both to...Saturday after...because I think...anyway and I also... It never fails.
- without...clari...do no...love...base...febr...swing...golf...why not Someone leaves a long phone message, asks you to call back...
- And then, at the very end, when they finally leave their number...

"- What the...
- Poink! YEEOWCH!!
- The next time I have a giant hair growing out of my eyebrow, feel free to tell me! We were kind of curious how long it would get before you noticed.",dr020620
"- Boys, you've been watching TV all afternoon!
- Here are a couple of books...
- If you hear your mom come home, turn off the TV and act like you're reading 'em!
- Keeping your kids out of trouble is part of a father's duty!",dr020621
"- Poor Bob! He always has that dazed and confused look on his face.
- Like he doesn't know who he is or what to do next!
- Kind of like dad on a Saturday! ...and then, after you fix the garbage disposal, the trees need trimming. After that you need to paint the patio furniture and clean out the garage...",dr020622
"- Hi, Ralph!
-
- How are you?
-
- You wouldn't be eating something on the new sofa, would you? Especially after I warned you never to do that!
- RALPH DRABBLE, OPEN YOUR MOUTH THIS INSTANT!!
- Nothing!
- You are SO not funny! I just like to freak her out sometimes!",dr020623
"- Hey, what was that?? Wait, I saw Tiger Woods! Slow down! I think I saw an elephant swimming! Whoa, a baseball game! Wait!!
- Let this be a lesson to you, son. Never relinquish control of the TV remote! This is known as ""payback"", Ralph! flip flip flip flip",dr020624
"- SLPOOSH!
-
-
- Next time you do a cannonball, dad, tell us so we can close the windows!",dr020625
"- Three balls, two strikes...two outs in the ninth...here's the pitch... *crack!* A high fly ball to deep center!
- OH, WHAT A CATCH!! Not only are you annoying, you're annoying at the worst possible time!",dr020626
"- Aren't you going to play golf today, dad? My golfing days are over.
- I think it's best to retire before I start to make a fool of myself!
- Actually, dad, it's probably a little late for that. Oh, yeah, huh.
- OK, never mind!",dr020627
"- I'm not sure which ball is mine!
- Norm, you should put distinctive markings on your ball.
- That way, you'll always know which one is yours!
- Is that why your balls all have stripes around them and say ""range""? Uh...yeah, that's it!",dr020628
"-
-
-
- Phone I know how you feel.",dr020629
"-
- KNOCK KNOCK

- UH...JUST A MINUTE, PLEASE!
- OK!
- *creak!*

- Out of respect for the community, I always knock before I go outside in my underwear!",dr020630
"-

- Crazy Mirrors Come on, dad, put your shirt back on and let's go on the coaster!",dr020701
"- If you like baseball, you're RELISHING this game!
- The sox trailed early, but MUSTERED four runs to CATCH UP! growl!
- What is it about baseball that makes me crave hot dogs? It's a BUNT!",dr020702
"- When I was 8 years old, there was a cool skateboard that I really, really wanted...
- But you said no, because it looked too dangerous. I was really mad and you said, ""trust me, son, one day you'll thank me.""
- Remember that, dad? Yes.
- Well, I just wanted you to know that I'm still kind of steamed about it. Thanks for the update, son!",dr020703
"- A picnic in the park, a ball game on the radio, and fireworks in the sky!
- It's a great tradition, isn't it? It sure beats fireworks on the radio!",dr020704
"- I don't mean to constantly criticize you, Norman...
- But I do it for your your own good!
- Just think of me as the wind beneath your wings!
- I guess that explains why I often like the cow in ""Twister"".",dr020705
"- Sometimes I wonder if I'd still be attracted to you if you liked me better.
- I guess that's one thing we'll never ever know, will we? I wish you were a little more inquisitive!",dr020706
"- Norman, what are you doing?
- Buying some books, dad! Why are you buying ten copies of the same book?
- Because each copy is marked 20% OFF! So?
- If each copy is 20% off, that means five copies will be 100% off! Therefore, the first five books are free!
- Six books would be 120% off, which means the store now owes ME 20%! Get it?
- So, if I buy ten books, not only are all the books free, but the store will owe ME 100%!
- I'M GONNA BE RICH!! It's hard to believe that boy flunked algebra!",dr020707
"- Hey, dad! I'm going to pull an ALL-NIGHTER tonight! Huh??
- I'm going to stay up all night long and watch TV! Why do you want to do that?
- Why go to bed? There's no school in the morning and I have no job to go to!
- How many opportunities like this will I ever have?? Quite a few, I'm willing to bet!",dr020708
"- Are you sure you want to stay awake all night, Norm? Absolutely!
- I'm going to stay up and watch TV and do fun stuff!
- But rest assured that while everyone else is fast asleep, I'll be standing guard over our home!
- Now *I* won't sleep!",dr020709
"- *Yawn* I never knew staying up all night would be so difficult!
- My eyelids are heavy. Fatigue is setting in...
- But I've come too far to give up now! What time is it, anyway?
- 9:15 Maybe I'll go splash cold water on my face!",dr020710
"- Hey, dad, would you like to stay up all night with me?
- Norm, need I to remind you that ONE of us has to get up early in the morning?
- What do you mean? Tomorrow's your day off!
- Yeah, but I still have to get to the donut shop by seven, or all the Long Johns get picked over!",dr020711
"- Part of the fun of staying up all night is watching scary movies!
- They always seem scarier in the middle of the night!
- YIKES!!
- When Mary Poppins slides up th staircase, it always freaks me out!",dr020712
"- It's the middle of the night,and I'm going to do something wild and crazy: T.P. the neighbor's house!
- On second thought, the neighbor's might not like that! I know, I'll T.P. my OWN house!
- On second thought, it's pretty dark and scary outside!
- Tell me again why you toilet-papered our kitchen. I'm a wild and crazy guy!",dr020713
"- OK, Norm, I want you to back up the car very slowly.
- Slow and steady! Keep it coming!
- Just a little bit more...
- OK! Thanks! There's no such thing as an empty tube of toothpaste!",dr020714
"- Dad, you parked in a loading zone!
- Is that appropriate?
- Believe me, when your dad goes to the all-you-can-eat buffet, it's appropriate! Where's the pizza?",dr020715
"- Hello, newsradio? Traffic-tipster Drabble, here...

- And would you please tell your listeners to quit bugging me for autographs! Hey, it's tipster Drabble!",dr020716
"- How was the movie, dad?
- It must have been pretty good! I only left to go to the bathroom once!
- I judge how good a movie was by how many times I had to go to the bathroom.
- That's an interesting rating system, dad! A ""one-flusher"" is first rate!",dr020717
"- Tipster Drabble reports that traffic is light on the evening commute!
- MRS. Drabble reports that she is very angry because tipster Drabble left gum in his shirt pocket again, and it went through the wash!
- We advise tipser Drabble to take an alternate route home...preferably a longer one, that will allow your wife to cool off!
- Those traffic reports give you a lot of information!",dr020718
"- Ralph, I can't believe you left gum in your shirt pocket again!
- It went through the wash, and now the shirt is ruined!
- How could you be so stupid?! I'M stupid??
- YOU'RE the one who married me!",dr020719
"- Ready, begin!
- wiggle wiggle wiggle
- wiggle wiggle wiggle
- ...and rest! That's the dumbest exercise program I've ever seen!",dr020720
"- Looks like you're in the lake again, dad!
- ...Sigh...
- All right. Hold my hat, please!
-
- Dad, I know golf is a frustrating game...
- But you really should quit throwing your clubs! Found 'em! Now let's go look for my ball!",dr020721
"- Smile, Ralph!
- Hey, don't point that thing at me!!
- Why not? Because the camera adds ten pounds!
- That's not as much as the bacon cheeseburgers add!",dr020722
"- Say, Wendy, would you like to go out with me on Friday?
- There is absolutely, positively no chance on earth of that happening!
- No way. No how. Case closed.
- So, would Thursday work better?",dr020723
"- Wendy, would you like to go out with me on Saturday?
- Nope. Forget it. Absolutely not.
- No chance. That's a negative. Sorry.
- I envy guys who get mixed signals!",dr020724

- Norman's swimmer ear!
- He's lying on his side so I can put drops in! drip!
- I hope it doesn't leak out the other ear and get on the sofa!",dr020725
"- Norman, why are you lying on the couch?
- I'm in discomfort.
- I have swimmer's ear, athlete's foot, and tennis elbow!
- And to think I flunked P.E. in high school!",dr020726
"- I drink one of these diet shakes for breakfast, one for lunch...
- And then have a sensible dinner, just like the directions say!
- So why am I not losing weight?
- Maybe it's the box of donuts you eat for brunch! They don't mention brunch, so I have to improvise!",dr020727

- tokkl okkl!
- I GOT A BIRDIE!!
- STOMP
- ...or not! Now I know why golfers need to stay in shape!",dr020728
"- There's nothing like being at a baseball game, Wendy!
- Except being at a football game. That's kind of being at a baseball game because there's a lot of grass and people and stuff.
- Come to think of it, a lot of things are like being at a baseball game.
- So disregard everything I said! No problem there!",dr020729
"- Norman, is something on your mind tonight?
- Well, yes, actually. How could I tell?
- Have I been acting peculiar? No.
- That was my first clue!",dr020730
"- Wendy, where are you going?? The snack bar. Excuse me...
- You can't leave now!! Something interesting is liable to appear on the giant message board any minute now!!
- What on earth are you...oh my gosh.
- Wendy, will you marry me? Norman",dr020731
"- Well, Rex, a wonderful thing has just happened here at ballpark! That's right, Steve!
- A young man named Norman has proposed to his beloved Wendy on the stadium jumbotron!
- How romantic to propose marriage in front of 56,000 fans!
- Love is in the air, eh, Wendy? It will be when I toss you out of the upper deck!",dr020801
"- Hey, that looks like Norman at the baseball game! It is, dad!
- Did he catch a foul ball? No, he just proposed Wendy on the stadium jumbotron!
- 56,000 fans are anxiously awaiting her reply! Come on, Wendy! Give Norman a big smooch!
- Ouch! That didn't look like a smooch! That's gonna leave a mark! Let's see the replay on that!",dr020802
"- SLAM! I'm home from the ball game! For future reference, son...
- Never propose a girl on the stadium jumbotron unless you're reasonably certain she'll say yes. Hindsight is 50/50.",dr020803
"- I'll take this one and that one! Yes, sir!
-
- What??
- Don't look at me like that!
- Aw, heck! Give me all the rest of 'em, too!
- I have a soft heart! I wish we could say the same about your arteries!",dr020804
"- You know, Norman, I've never thought of you as handsome...
- But sometimes, if the light is just right...
- And I squint and make my eyes all blurry...
- On second thought, never mind! Wow! That's as close to a compliment as I've ever gotten!",dr020805
"- I'm back from the golf course, honeybunch! What was your score?
- 107. Yipes!
- Hey, it wasn't as bad as it sounds!
- with a few breaks here and there, I could've easily shot 104!",dr020806
"- Wendy, would you like to go miniature golfing with me tomorrow tonight?
- I'm sorry, Norman, but I already made plans to floss my dog's teeth!
- Actually, that isn't true.
- I'm not sorry!",dr020807
"- Wow! I'm impressed!
- Hey, you must be important!
- Apparently, it's now a symbol of prestige NOT to have a cell phone! Show off!",dr020808
"- Wendy, how would you like to go to the movies tonight? Sorry, I'm busy.
- Next time you ask me out, it would be more polite to give me a little advance notice!
- How would you like to go to the movies a week from Saturday? I'm still busy.
- How would you like to see ""Star Wars-Episode III"" in 2005? I only said it would be more polite, not more effective.",dr020809
"- WHACK!
- FORE!!
- CRASH!
- I hollered ""fore!"" It's not my fault if that condominium didn't get out of the way!",dr020810

- Q: Why do cats rub up against your leg? A: Because they're stupid.
- Q: Why do cats purr? A: Because they're stupid.
- Go ahead, try to stump me!",dr020819
"- Oogie has gone from one extreme to the other!
- She used to attack me all the time. Now she just sits in my lap and purrs! How annoying!
- You just don't appreciate cats! I do SO appreciate cats!
- I think they make excellent tennis rackets!",dr020820
"- Ralph, I made an appointment for you to take Oogie to a cat psychologist! Purr!
- A CAT PSYCHOLOGIST?? He'll be able to tell you why Oogie has been acting strangely.
- I already know why Oogie has been acting strangely...
- Because she has a brain the size of a macadamia nut! You're just jealous!",dr020821
"- I can't believe I'm talking to a cat psychologist.
- It's a growing profession! Few people understand their pet cats!
- In order to understand pet cats, one must THINK like a cat!
- Excuse me...I have an itch! Looks like we've come to the right place!",dr020822
"- What did the cat psychologist say? Purrr!
- He said cats gravitate to the person who pays them the least attention. Oogie has been nice to me because I've been ignoring her.
- He said if I want Oogie to act like her old self, I should pay more attention to her. Did he say anything else?
- No, then he sat on the window sill and took a nap!",dr020823
"- According to the cat psychologist, the way to make Oogie act like her old self is to pay more attention to her! OK. Purrr!

- What are you asking ME for, Ralph? Because you're my favorite neighbor!
- That's one of the things I admire about you-your sense of modesty!
- Aren't you the same guy who called police because my wind chime was too loud?
- Ha ha ha! That's another thing I admire about you, Steinbauer! You have a fantastic memory!",dr020909
"- Good morning, Steinbauer! I brought you some fresh cinnamon rolls!
- What's going on, Ralph? If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to kiss-up me!
- Me?? Kiss up??? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
- Steinbauer, I can honestly say that you have the quickest wit in America!",dr020910
"- Ralph, does your sudden neighborliness have anything to do with the sign in my front yard? Sing??
- Another Pool By Polecat Pools Are you trying to weasel an invitation to swim in my new pool?
- Gee, I didn't realize that!
- Then why did you come here in fins? They provide excellent arch support!",dr020911
"- I see your new pool's all finished, Steinbauer!
- Wow! It's got everything! Waterfall, hot tub, slide...I'll bet it's going to be great for entertaining!
- If I had a pool like that, the first thing I'd want to do is invite the neighbors over to enjoy it with me!
- Subtle as a train wreck, Ralph! Did I mention I got a snorkel for Christmas?",dr020912
"- Boy, this is the life, Ralph!
- Too bad you've been such a creep over the years, or I'd invite you in for a dip!
- Creep???! Who's the guy who picked up your newspaper every day when you were on vacation? You.
- You also pick up my newspaper every day when I'm NOT on vacation! Yeah, but I usually put most of it back!",dr020913
"- You shouldn't stare into Mr. Steinbauer's back yard, dad. It's not polite! I don't care.
- I'm going to start at his new pool until he invites me over to go swimming.
- Eventually, my sad and forlorn look will make him feel guilty! SPLOOSH!
- I don't think it's working. Nice cannonball!",dr020914

- ...17, 18, 19. What's the matter? Don't you trust me?",dr020915
"- No-Neck! Why are you in Steinbauer's new pool?
- He invited a bunch of people over to go swimming today!
- He said he invited practically everyone in town!
- How come YOU'RE not over here, Ralph? I'm the ""practically"".",dr020916
"- Hello, police? This is Ralph Drabble. I'd like to report a public nuisance!
- My neighbor, George Steinbauer, is having a wild pool party. It's well after six P.M. and I'm sure there must be a curfew in effect?
- No?? Well maybe I should speak to the chief! ...he's what? ...OK, never mind.
- The chief is at Steinbauer's pool party!",dr020917

- Did somebody call me?
- Buzz off, Ralph! We're trying to play ""Marco Polo"". Oh.
- From a distance, it sounded like ""Come over and go swimming, Ralph!"" I need a taller fence!",dr020918
"- Steinbauer, if you don't want to invite me to go swimming in your new pool, that's fine with me!
- Who needs your pool? I've got my own pool, and it's just as wet as yours!
- Right, guys? Actually, dad, I don't think there's any water left in here!",dr020919
"- I can't believe Steinbauer would build a new pool and not invite me swimming!
- Then, to add insult to injury, he throws a big pool party and invites everyone except me and my family!
- If it makes you feel any better, dad, YOU'RE the only one he didn't invite! Thanks for the clarification, son.",dr020920
"- Steinbauer, what do YOU want?
- I want to invite you to go swimming in my new pool!
- I've been feeling ashamed. I'm sorry I didn't invite you sooner! sniff!

- I snuck into your yard last night and stocked your new pool with trout! YOU WHAT??",dr020921

- Their first customer wins free donuts for life!",dr020924
"- Dad, I know you're excited about the new ""Krunchy Kakes"" donut shop, but why are you camping out?? Because their first customer will receive free donuts for life!
- But, it's going to be a long time before this place is finished! Can you afford to take this much time off work?
- I've dome the math...the money I'll save on lifetime donuts will more than compensate for my lost wages!",dr020925
"- Hi, dad! How's the camp-out going? It's exciting!
- When these ""Krunchy Kakes"" opens its doors, I'll be their first customer and win free donuts for life!!
- By the way, ho's everything at home? Mom says it's not the same around the house without you.
- So she put the philodendron in your easy chair and said that's pretty close! I'm glad she still has that wonderful sense of humor.",dr020926
"- Well, Norm, the grand opening is at hand!
- I'll be their first customer, and thereby win free donuts for the rest of my life!
- There will undoubtedly be media coverage, so I should go freshen up!
- Hold my place in line, Norm! You can count on me, dad! 'scuse me.",dr020927
"- What the... Dad, I have some bad news and some good news...
- The bad news is, I inadvertently stepped out of line and lost your place...

- Dad, I just saw a sign that said ""1,000 Fine For Littering"". So?
- It seems to me that $1,000 would be fine for a lot of things, but littering isn't one of them!

- What did she say?
- ""I don't really like you very much."" Sounds like a subtle hint!",dr030711

"- Modern technology is amazing.
- Whenever something is wrong with the car, a warning sign flashes on the dashboard.
- For example, if one of our lights is burned out, a picture of a light bulb flashes.
- If we're low on oil, it flashes a picture of an oil can.
- When it flashes the words ""service engine soon"", it means we're due for a tune-up.
- So, what does THAT sign mean?
- I don't know, but something tells me it isn't good!",dr040404
"- I'm home!

"- Happy anniversary, Wendy! Huh?
- Today is the anniversary of the first time I ever set eyes upon you.
- We stepped into an elevator together and I said, ""going up?""
- And you said, ""we're on the ground floor, Einstein. Where else would we go?""
- And I said, ""You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Norman.""

- I'm due for a shave for another three weeks!",dr040415
"- How come you have so much cologne, dad?
- Everyone gives it to me for Christmas, birthdays and father's day!

- About 45 seconds.
- Perfect! I need to allow time for several standing ovations!",dr040520

"- Norman, I told you to turn the TV OFF! I am, mom! flip flip flip

- First, I'm going to eat a big bowl of ice cream!
- Then, I'm going to watch a ball game on TV!
- After that, I'll take a nap, and when I wake up, I'll have some more ice cream!
- Then I'll relax until dinner. After that, I'll watch a little more TV, then I'll go to bed early!
- How's THAT for a plan?
- That's exactly what you do EVERY Sunday! Yeah, we were hoping you'd want to do something different for father's day! If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",dr040620

- You only thought about it for half a second! That's three-tenths of a second longer than I needed!",dr040624

- It would be an opportunity for bonding!
- You know something, you're right. It WOULD lead to bonding...
- Not to mention casts, slings and stitches!",dr040625
"- Ralph, what have you got against camping??
- Honeybunch, camping is just plain wrong.
- For thousands of years, man has known that it is better to sleep Indoors than OUTdoors!
- That's why we were called CAVEmen instead of OUTSIDEmen! Leave your relatives out of it!",dr040626
"- Uh-oh...
- RALPH Don't eat all the brownies. Don't try to fix the sink-I'll call a plumber. Don't forget to put away your junk. Don't trim the trees. You always make them look worse! Don't tease the cat. Don't mess up the living room. H.B.

"- I'm not applying for this extreme home makeover for my own sake...
- It's for my good wife, who works her fingers to the bone raising our three children.
- I was hoping you could redo our yard and install one of those big, synthetic putting greens for her!
- She doesn't like golf but at least she wouldn't have to mow the lawn any more!",dr050224
"- Here's one of our biggest problems: our neighbor, Mr. Steinbauer!
- He's the worst neighbor EVER! Is it any wonder why I'm a nervous wreck??
- If you're applying for a home makeover, forget it! As president of the Neighborhood Homeowners Association, we'd never approve any drastic changes!
- Hopefully, you'll have to knock down his house to make room for my new pool!",dr050225
"- Well, that's my application video! I look forward to the arrival of the Extreme Home Makeover team!
- We'll pack our bags for the fabulous vacation you'll send us on while you're fixing up this dump!
- Remember, I'd like a home theater, a rumpus room, an indoor gym and a built-in barbecue! I hope it's not too much to ask!
- If it is, just send us on the vacation!",dr050226

- Something tells me you do a lot of shopping here. I do seem to get a warmer welcome than most!",dr050227
"- Take my advice, son...
- When you grow up and take a bride, get married on her birthday!
- That way, if you forget her birthday and your anniversary, you'll only get trouble once a year.
- Thanks, dad. Mind if I stay up here in your treehouse for a few days?",dr050228
"- HA HA ho ho ho HEE HEE HEE chuckle hoo hoo hoo I love it when the sound of laughter fills the house, don't you, Ralph? Sure.

- Could you offer just a little more information? Oh, sure, mom.
- It was pretty good!",dr050311
"- Some people say we should have eyes on the backs of our heads.
- I think we should have eyes on our hands. That way, if you're at a parade and you want to see better...
- All you have to do is this!
- Of course, then you'd need a really big pair of sunglasses! Norman, RUN!",dr050312

- You told me that yesterday! Oh, yeah. Sorry!",dr050315
"-
- Yeah, this is a little better, but I STILL think you should buy a big screen!",dr050316
"- OW!!

- What were you thinking??
- I was thinking I'd like to have Wendy pinch me!",dr050317

- What did you see?
- A bunch of naked statues. Oh, well...

- Sometime you just have to make the best of a bad situation!",dr050323

- I meant if *I* wore glasses! Oh...couldn't hurt!",dr050324
"- I'm always surprised that you continue to go out with me, when you never seem to have a good time!
- I've come to the conclusion that being with you is my punishment for misdeeds I must have committed in a previous life.
- When I spend time with you, I feel like I'm paying my debt to society!
- I'm glad I can help. I just don't know what on earth I could have possibly done that was so BAD!!",dr050325
"- Yes, uh-huh...

"- Have a seat, Mr. Drabble!
- The doctor will see you shortly. Uh-huh.
- When they say the doctor will see you shortly, it doesn't mean he'll see you SOON...
- It means when he finally DOES see you, it won't be for very long!",dr050331
"- Mr. Drabble, I've studied your test results, and I'm afraid it's bad news.

- He's a mall cop! DON'T HELP ME!",dr050525
"- Our new readers may be wondering about the duck...
- His name is Bob, and he's not really a duck! He's a rare South American parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle.

- And it better be true because I hate ducks! On day, I hope to migrate to a different comic strip!",dr050526

- Research shows we have between 23 and 24 million readers!

- How can that be?! I've been starving myself ever since we started our diet contest!
- Maybe the scale is adjusted to high, honeybunch!
- Nope, it says I've LOST three pounds!",dr050614

"- Hey! Let's get this shirt for dad for Father's Day! World's #1 Dad
- ""World's Number One Dad""? Isn't that kind of unrealistic?
- Why? Well, think about it...
- There are more than 6 billion people in the world, so there must be at least a couple of billion dads!
- Dad couldn't possibly be the world's number ONE dad! And he warned us never to exaggerate!
- If he's not number one, where does he rank? Well, it's safe to say he's in the top billion...
- Happy Father's Day! Thanks for the ringing endorsement, kids. World's 34,892,671 Dad It's a good thing you wear an ""XXL""!",dr050619

- You mean the parking lot tram? Man, I thought I was gonna lose my lunch!",dr050624
"- Well, we're all tired, but we had a fun day at the amusement park!

- Wally, if you're going to jump off the diving board, you've got to commit to it!",dr050701
"- What flavor of dog food should I buy for Wally?
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters! If he doesn't like it, he might not eat it!
- How about the chicken with rice? Get something that tastes like my cushion insoles. He ate those yesterday!",dr050702
"- When we get home, remind me to check your father's pedometer!
- What's a pedometer?? It's a little device that measures how far you walk! I bought it for him yesterday.
- The doctor told him he needs to walk at least two miles a day in order to lose weight! I can't wait to see how far he's gone today!

"- STRIKE HIM OUT, HUNTER! TAKE HIM DOWNTOWN, PATRICK!!

"- You sure bought lots of stuff! Do we really NEED all this?
- Are you implying that I'm a compulsive shopper??
- Not at all!
- But, just out or curiosity, why did you by two canes? We're going to be old one day, and they were on sale!",dr050714
"- How was the movie?
- According to the Ralph Drabble Rating System, it was a seven.

- Whenever you're at the beach, it's important to protect your skin!
- I'd say we're protected, mom! Better safe than sorry!",dr050727
"- You need more sunscreen!
- What is it about mom that makes her want to put sunscreen on us all the time?? It's maternal instinct!
- Moms have a natural inclination to protect everyone from getting sunburned.
- ...whether she knows them or not! Hey, lady! Why are you putting sunscreen all over me?? Have you never heard of global warming?",dr050728
"- Who else at this beach needs sunscreen?!
- How about you? NO, thank you, I don't like sunscreen!
- Lady, I don't WANT any sunscreen!! Hold still! You'll thank me when you're old!! You might not believe this, but when I married your mom, she was fairly normal!",dr050729
"- Are you wearing two pairs of glasses?? Yes, reading glasses and sunglasses.
- Why? Because I'm outside and I'm reading.
- OK, but shouldn't you be wearing the sunglasses over the reading glasses? No.
- Why? Because that would be stupid!",dr050730

- The future is now, isn't it, son! What an amazing time to be alive!",dr050804

- I thought it might be fun to go to the Minimart for a cherry slush, and then watch ourselves in the security monitor!

"- Ralph, I can't believe you ate all the chocolate dough!

- Oh, yeah, huh! It's been a long day, hasn't it?",dr050813
"-

"- Wow!! This is AMAZING!!
- Awesome! Spectacular! Breathtaking!! You mean, this is IT??",dr050815
"- Isn't Niagara Falls amazing?! For thousands of years, water has poured into the river below!
- Just THINK about it!
- How come the water never runs out? Why doesn't the river overflow? Can you imagine their monthly water bill? OK, OK...stop thinking about it!",dr050816

"- What was the purpose of your vacation, Mr. Drabble?
- We just wanted to see Niagara Falls from the other side! Honest!

"- Oh, boy! Cookies!! Better not, dad. Mom warned us not to have any before dinner!
- Yeah, if she notices any missing, we might get in trouble!
- Relax, boys. Watch and learn from the master!
- You'll notice these cookies come in a plastic tray, in three rows. There are already a few cookies missing.
- Now, if we take one cookie, it will be obvious. If we take two cookies, it will be obvious...
- But, if we take one cookie from each row, we'll have THREE cookies, and no one will notice the difference! Wow!
- How did dad get to be so smart? Apparently, the same way he got to be so fat!",dr050828

- Because mommy likes Chinese food, so we're all going to the restaurant! Why!
- Because we're a family, and you're part of our family, and you're going to come with us! Why?
- Penny, you need to think more of others and less about yourself! Why?

"- There's a cute new girl working at the yogurt shop! I'll impress her by putting a dollar in her tip jar!
- Crud! She didn't see me do it! NOW what should I do??
- Do nothing! Anonymous gifts are the most generous gifts of all! I say reach into the jar, pull out the dollar, and give it to her again when she's looking!
- How come I always like the ""Dumb Norm's"" ideas better?",dr050907
"- Darn! She didn't see me put a tip in her jar! Now she'll think I'm a cheapskate!

- How did you KNOW there was about to be an earthquake?? Norman started acting strangely!",dr050911
"- How did he get his hand stuck in the girl's tip jar? He took my advice and reached in to get his dollar back, so he can put it back in when she's looking!
- FOOMP!
- What a bonehead! Dang! I forgot to get the dollar! Reach in again!",dr050912
"- I need to get my dollar back out of the tip jar so she can see me give it to her!

- Well done?? I thought you liked your burgers rare! I do.

- My day is RUINED!!
- You better get well soon, buster!! Florence Nightingale, she's not!",dr060703

"- Dad, I think we need to get you to the doctor.
- How on earth am I going to get to the doctor?? I can't even get in the car!! No problem...
- Mr. Steinbauer loaned us his pick-up truck!",dr060707
"- Where's dad? Norman drove him to the doctor.
- He threw out his back and couldn't stand up straight!
- The only way to drive him was to lay him down gently in the back of a pick-up truck!
- Sorry, I took that speed bump a little fast!",dr060708
"- Medical Care I need to see the doctor. I threw out my back! Take a seat, Mr. Drabble!
- Take a seat== How am I supposed to do that?!
- Don't worry, dad! I'll help you...

- BUT I KNOW I DON'T! Dad's halfway to being able to forgive and forget!",dr060724
"- Hey, Ralph! What is it, Steinbauer?
- I'm having a backyard pool party tonight! Everyone in the neighborhood is invited!
- Well, everyone except you. I had to draw the line somewhere!
- I suddenly remember why I don't like him! By the way, can I borrow some oil for my tiki torches?",dr060725
"- How DARE Steinbauer throw a pool party and not invite me!
- Well, I intend to get even! Now, Ralph, you must act like an adult!
- Trust me. I will handle this in a mature fashion!
- I'm going to T.P. his house!",dr060726
"- The last light has gone out in the Steinbauer home! Time to T.P.!
- Box, this takes me back!
- I can barely remember the last time I T.P'd a house!
- I couldn't have been more than 37 or 38!",dr060727
"- Steinbauer's house never looked better!
- Whoa, I'm exhausted!
- I should make a mental note for next time...
- To T.P. a 2,000-square foot house, four dozen rolls is plenty!",dr060728
"- I'll fling one more roll at Steinbauer's house, and call it a night!
- Ahem...
-
- You know you've got a tough cop when he's wearing sunglasses at two A.M.!",dr060729
"- Why, good evening, officer! You're probably wondering why I'm flinging bathroom tissue at that house!
- You see, the man who lives there hosted a pool party earlier tonight...
- And I'm the only one in the neighborhood who wasn't invited!
- Gosh, it's hard to believe someone wouldn't invite a guy like you to a party! My thoughts exactly!!",dr060731
"- Officer, I look it looks bad for a grown man to be toilet-papering a house...
- But the man who lives there, Mr. Steinbauer, is a very difficult person!
- You're ""teepee-ing"" STEINBAUER'S house???
- Why didn't you just SAY so?! I take it you're familiar with him!",dr060801
"- The sun up! I can't wait to see Steinbauer's house!
- It must be foggy outside! I can't see a thing!
- Oh no...
- I TEEPEED MY OWN HOUSE!!",dr060802
"- You teepeed your own house?? Why in the world did you do THAT, dad??
- It was dark! It was late! I was half asleep!!
- Gosh, this is something I would do! Now THAT hurts!",dr060803
"- Someone teepeed your house, eh, Drabble? Who would do such a thing??
- Ah, there's a clue: This paper is a single-ply, generic brand!
- Whoever did this is obviously a cheapskate!
- I'd say you teepeed your own home, but even YOU aren't THAT stupid!",dr060804
"- I can't believe your father teepeed our own house last night!
- That's the stupidest thing he's ever done!
- Although re-rolling the paper is a close second! ""Waste not, want not"" I always say!",dr060805
"- It's not fair!
- I've been eating right! I've been exercising! How come I'm still fat?!
- This new diet isn't working!!
- You've only been on it for 45 minutes! I'll give it another half hour, and then I'm ordering a pizza!",dr060807
"- Something wrong, dad? My birthday is in a few days and I'm dreading it!
- There's nothing to dread about having a birthday!
- You should know that!
- You've had a million of 'em!",dr060808
"- Ralph, the credit card bills will be arriving any day...
- Now, remember, you've got a birthday coming up, and I may have bought you a gift or two!
- So, when the bills arrive, don't look at them...
- Just pay them!",dr060809
"- Good morning, dad. On behalf of the entire family, I'd like to wish you a pleasant birthday.
- That was pretty unenthusiastic! At your age, the less excitement, the better. Here's a balloon. We didn't blow it up 'cause it might pop!",dr060810
"- Bring in dad's birthday cake, Patrick!
- You baked me a cake?? Well, not exactly...
- We made a cake out of donuts! One for each year of your life!
- Wow! We emptied out three donut shops!",dr060811
"- Oh, boy! Another can of Slim-Fast!
- That makes three! One from Norman, one from Patrick, and one from Penny!
- Great minds think alike, huh, dad?
- I guess it's better than last year when they all gave me nose hair trimmers!",dr060812
"- I saved your best birthday gift for last, Ralph!
- Tickets for you and me to see Barry Manilow in Las Vegas!!
-
- I'm so excited! I'll go pack! Is this MY birthday or YOURS??",dr060814
"- So, here we are, driving for hours through the blistering desert.
- Because, for MY birthday, you gave me tickets to see YOUR favorite singer perform in Las Vegas.
- This is payback for your Valentine's gift, isn't it, honeybunch? Nonsense! What woman wouldn't love to receive a variable speed jigsaw?!",dr060815
"- I'm so excited to be driving to Las Vegas to see Barry Manilow!
- The first time we saw him in concert was on our first date, 25 years ago! You proposed to me after he sang ""Mandy""!
- We've seen Barry Manilow in concert before??
- GIVE ME A BREAK! MY MEMORY ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE!!",dr060816
"- You can get back in the car, Ralph.
- Just because you couldn't remember our first date when we saw Barry Manilow and you proposed to me, I shouldn't have driven off and left you in the desert.
- So I decided to pull over because I forgive you!
- And also because we're out of gas! rrrrrr...",dr060817
"- Here's your light stick, Ralph! What's that for?
- The concert! When Barry sings ""Copacabana"", everyone in the audience stands up, waves their light stick, and dances!
- Have a good time, honeybunch! Ralph, get back in the car!!",dr060818
"- Our hotel room is pretty nice!
- Look! We have a view of a hotel that has a view of the Las Vegas strip!
- rrummble rrummble clankity clank clank clank clank clank!
- And, apparently, we're very close to the ice machines! That's convenient. I can go get ice in my underwear.",dr060819
"- Honeybunch, before we go see the Barry Manilow concert, I'm going to visit the casinos.
- It's probably best if you stay here in the room.
- I'll be doing some serious high-stakes wagering, and it's not for the faint of heart! I understand!
- You forgot your roll of nickels! Oh yeah...thank you!",dr060821
"- You're not going to wear that out in public, are you? Why not?
- It's immodest!
- Just because we're in Las Vegas, doesn't mean you should dress like a showgirl!
- I think my strapless apron looks nice!",dr060822
"- Slots

- ...sigh...
- The ice machine is as close as I ever come to hitting a jackpot in Vegas! clankity clank clank clank clank clank",dr060823
"- Manilow Concert I'll make a bet with you that my seat is directly behind that big guy's.
- You win! If only I was this good at the blackjack table!",dr060824
"- At the Copa...
- Copacabana..

- Please tell me you didn't just throw your apron at Barry's feet! sorry. I got carried away!",dr060825
"- Hi, Norman! I'm just calling to tell you we're leaving Las Vegas and we're on our way home!
- Yes, the concert was great!
- I think your father even liked it!",dr060826
"- Hey, honeybunch! How about something to drink?!
-
- I meant in a glass!",dr060828
"-
- I've decided to join the circus!
- CRASH * bounce bounce * OW! * Jerque du Soleil!",dr060829
"- Only one more week until school starts again! Aww! I know! I's going to be lonely around here!
- I'm going to miss you! What will I do all day long?!
- Meryl Streep, eat your heart out!",dr060830
"- Here's a good one...
- ""What kind of dog tells time?"" ""A WATCH dog!""
- HAR HAR HAR HAR!
- I'll tell that one Tuesday morning! Can't YOU drive my school carpool this year, mom?",dr060831

"- Hello, this is Ralph Drabble! May I speak to Jerry, please?
- Every year, I call the telethon and ask to speak to Jerry, but they never...
- Hello? Ahhhhh...waaaaaa...haaaaa...
- Well, nice to talk to you! I've got to go, now. Wayne Newton is almost done with his song! 'bye! You forgot to mention how much we liked ""Cinderella""!",dr060904
"- Here's another good one: ""What is Dracula's favorite place in New York?""
- ""The Vamipre State Building!""
- ""What is a mummy's favorite kind of music?"" ""Wrap!""
- Boy, I could read these all night! SUPERMAN, WHERE ARE YOU?!",dr060905
"- You kids are sitting awfully close to the TV!
- When I was a kid, mom told me not to sto too close to the TV because the rays would make my hair fall out!
- You should have listened!",dr060906
"-
- SNIFFFFF!
- AAAAKK! cough cough cough! HACK! COUGH COUGH!!
- Whoever said ""stop and smell the dandelions"" was out of his mind! I think they said ""roses"".",dr060907
"- Oowww! I told you if you ate your ice cream too fast, you'd get a headache!
- I'm the voice of experience! Why don't you kids ever listen to me??
- We parents may not be as smart as we think we are...
- But we're not as dumb as our KIDS think we are!",dr060908

"- Wendy, would you like to go out for dinner with me tonight?
- Norman, whenever you ask me out, I have a conflict between my head and my heart!
- My head says, ""no way!""
- But my heart says, ""absolutely not a chance in heck!"" Does your stomach have an opinion?",dr060914
"- MALL Excuse me, officer...
- Where is a store called ""Things Remembered""?
- I forget.
- I've been waiting ten years for somebody to ask me that!",dr060915

- Quack, eh?
- He's been hanging out with these Canadian geese, again!",dr060916
"- Here's our room! My friends Leonard and Stu talked me into taking a drawing class!
- Gee, I wonder if I'll discover that I have a hidden talent? Probably! If you have any talent, Norman, it's hidden!",dr060918
"- Leonard, Stu...I don't know why I let you guys talk me into taking a DRAWING class!
- I'm already pretty good at drawing!
- You couldn't draw a bath!
- SLAP! Nerds always like to high-five each other after witty remarks!",dr060919
"- Leonard, tell me again why we all signed-up for a drawing class!
- To expand our horizons, acquire an appreciation for the arts, and develop skills we never knew we had!
-
- ...that, and the nude models. WHAT??",dr060920
"- Did you say something about NUDE MODELS??
- Yeah, the teacher said we were going to be sketching a model in the nude.
- That means the model won't have any clothes on. OH, WHAT A RELIEF!!
- I thought he meant WE wouldn't have any clothes on!",dr060921
"- We have to draw a NUDE MODEL??! I don't think I could DO that!! I'd be too uncomfortable!
- I can't do it! I can't do it!! Norman, pull yourself together!
- Yeah, this is ART! We must conduct ourselves with dignity and maturity!
- In fact, to show how mature we are, let's move to the front row! NO!",dr060922
"- Uhhh...Norman? You're right, Stu! We have to be mature about this!
- Norman? We shouldn't act like nerds!
- We have to...what is it, Leonard? I think our model has arrived...
- And look who it is!",dr060923
"- Sorry I'm late, professor! Class, I'd like you to meet...
- HALT THE PROCEEDINGS!!
- Wendy, I beg you not to do this!
- Why not? It's art, isn't it? I want every man in here to close his eyes! Especially Leonard and Stu!!",dr060925
"- Wendy, I appreciate your dedication to the arts, but I beg you not to remove your clothes!
- I'd be too uncomfortable!
- Mr, Drabble, Wendy isn't here to model! She's a student in the class, just like you!
- Please don't say I'm just like him! Sorry. Uh-oh...my contact lenses have already fogged-up!",dr060926
"- I'm not here to be a nude model!! I'm here to take the class!!
- We don't HAVE nude models in this class, Mr. Drabble!
- Where on earth did you get an idea like that?? Well, I, uhh...
- *",dr060927

- The only thing we're going to draw today is this bowl of fruit!
- Hey, where is it??!
-",dr060928
"- Why did you guys tell me there would be nude models in our drawing class?!
- I nearly made a complete fool of myself!

- For one thing, you'd need a lap!",dr061003
"- I'm considering putting my personal profile on this teen web site!
- Aren't you concerned that someone might try to steal your identity?
- MY identity??
- Good point. You mean there's a bigger loser than ME out there??",dr061004
"- Norm, I really don't think you should put your personal profile on that teen web site!
- You might regret it! Some kids end up looking pretty foolish!
- What if a prospective employer saw it?
- Shouldn't be a problem! Oh, yeah...you'd have to apply for a job first!",dr061005
"- What are you doing? If you hold up your putter like this, it helps you line up your putt!

- No, I'm not!

- Farmer Fred never accused YOU of trying to steal a pumpkin under your shirt! Easy mistake.",dr061018
"- We've come to Farmer Fred's Pumpkin Patch every October since I was a little kid!
- I'll never forget the time years ago, when dad hid behind the scarecrow and yelled ""boo!""
- I was so scared, I began hyperventilating, and mom made me breathe into a paper sack!
- Actually, Norm, that was LAST year. I had nightmares until labor day!",dr061019
"- That'll be $12.50!
- $12.50?!! How can you charge that much for a pumpkin??!
- It's really big! Fine!
- And just so you won't ask me again this year-no, I do not have a pumpkin under my shirt. See?!!

- Why? Am I late?
- No, I was just wondering what happened to you!",dr061023
"- Do you have any plans for after school, Norman? Absolutely!
- First, I'll ask Wendy for a date. When she says no, I'll probably sit around and play video games for the rest of the day!

- Kids see scarier things every day! Now, THAT'S scary!",dr061026
"- I can't believe you kids don't think these old monster movies are scary!

- So, why is he living in a tract home in the suburbs??! Our backyard looks like a jungle!",dr070725
"- You know, Bob, I appreciate the fact that, in reality, you're a rare south American parrot that takes o the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle...

- Tell us about it, Norman! Well, my strategy was to drive the green and put the ball in the hole on the third bounce!

- Anything you'd like to add to that? He used MY BALL and MY CLUB! I should get SOME credit!!",dr070824
"- Norman, do you think your father is jealous of your hole-in-one? Absolutely not! My dad thought me everything I know!
- He taught me how to tee it up and how to follow through! My dad is the greatest!
- I LOVE YOU, SON!!
- He also thought me how to kick the ball out of the rough when no one's looking! OK, son! That's enough praise! sniff!",dr070825

- Dad's idea of health food is strawberry ice cream!",dr070901
"- Ralph, for heaven's sake! Park the car already!
- Yeah, dad! Why are we going to the very back of the parking lot??
- Because when you have a fancy new car, you like to park it as far away as possible and hope that no one parks next to you!
- New car owners can be a little paranoid!
- Oh yeah, huh! That makes sense!
- ...except we don't HAVE a new car! Your father like to park right next to the new car owners just to annoy them! It's a long walk, but well worth it!",dr070902

- If your child id not a good hitter, that's fine. I'll teach him never to swing the bat, and to try to get hit by a pitch!
- I will teach your child what little I know about baseball, unless he starts getting better than *my* son. Then your child will get benched.

- Honeybunch, we've lived here for 20 YEARS! I already know my way around town!
- Besides, I have a keen sense of direction! Sense of direction??!
- You once got lost in a drive-thru car wash!
- There was very poor visibility in there!",dr080506

- There are some thugs outside the mall, who are up to no good!

- This man is indeed a living legend in the field of mall coppery!
- Don't get a swollen head! Who, me?",dr080519
"- Tonight's recipient of the lifetime achievement award is the man who actually coined the term ""Mall Cop.""
- Before that, we were just known as ""indoor retail security personnel"", which wasn't as catchy!

- Why are you crying? I never realized how GREAT I was!",dr080520
"- Hi, mom! Hi, dad! Norm, you're just in time to see me receive the lifetime achievement award!

- Because my friend No-Neck is the same age as I am, eats the same stuff as I do, and does all the things I do!
- He gets a physical every year and he's always fine! If he's fine, I must be fine!

"- For me?? Wow! It's wonderful being married to me, isn't it, Ralph?
-
- Yes!
- The correct answer is useless if your timing is off!",dr090205
"- Son, your problem is that you lie down on your back and let people walk all over you.

- And why do you suppose that is?
- Maybe they don't want to walk uphill! I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU!!",dr090206
"- ...so, my Dad was saying that...
- Hey, are you using that chair?
- This chair that I'm sitting in?? Yeah, can I borrow it=

"- I need a favor, Norm. What is it, Stu?
- I want you to go to Monique's house and ask her to be my valentine!
- Why do I have to do it? Because I can't handle rejection!
- And I CAN??! I figured you're an expert by now!",dr090212
"- Yes? Hello, Monique!
- My friend Stu wants to know if you'll be his Valentine.
- He's a little on the shy side, so he asked me to ask for him!

"- Hey, Wally! Want to go outside and play ball? ?

- Dad does that too sometimes, when Mom's talking to him! ...and when you buy the head of lettuce, pick out a *good* one! The ones in front are all picked-over, so reach for one in the back, but not the *bottom* of the back because it will be all squished... ?",dr090216

- My own son will be the star of the team, doing most of the pitching and batting clean-up! He'll play every inning of every game!
- I decided to become a coach for one reason: to ensure that my son makes the all-star team and gets a big trophy!
- If your child id not a good hitter, that's fine. I'll teach him never to swing the bat, and to try to get hit by a pitch!
- I will teach your child what little I know about baseball, unless he starts getting better than *my* son. Then your child will get benched.
- Hey, at least this coach is honest! For my year-end coach's gift, I'd like a gift certificate from Ted's Steak House!",dr090301

"- What are we doing *here*? I thought we were going to get ice cream!
- I'm taking you to the hospital, dad! What for??

- I hope your future self also sent you tonight's winning numbers so we can *pay* for this!",dr090305
"- Please don't let me need surgery! Please don't let me need surgery!

"- This is crazy, Norm. We've been waiting here a long time!.
- I'm not sick. I'm just a little run-down, that's all!

- Good luck, Wendy. This Norman guy sounds like a real loser!! OK, let's turn on sports talk, now!",dr090308
"- What brings you here, Mr. Drabble? My son insisted I come, doctor.
- I've been a little sick, but I really think I'm OK!

- We'll run some tests on both of you. By the way, don't tell the doctors about the texts!",dr090309

- You cook breakfast for us every day of the week, and do so without a complaint, Pancakes and bacon, sausage and eggs, our mother's indeed a saint! But today is the day that we honor our mom so we did cooking instead. Waffles, french toast and eggs over easy. We hope you like breakfast in bed! Now we don't mean to spoil this wonderful day, but there's something we must confess. We're not good at cooking, and not very neat. So the kitchen is kind of a mess! The milk got spilled, the batter splattered, our hearts are filled with sorrow. But today is *your' day, mom, so we must insist, don't clean it all up tomorrow!
- And we *mean* it, too! Good luck getting the grape jelly off the ceiling!",dr090510

"- I love coming to the buffet, honeybunch!
- T do too, Ralph.
- The only problem is that you tend to overeat! Don't worry...
- I've devised a new strategy!
- Ad soon as my stomach touches the edge of the table, I'll know it's time to stop eating!
- CRASH! BREAK! WHAM! SMASH!
- I think you should stop now! Sorry. I guess that was one too many chocolate-chip muffins!",dr091213
"- We're so lucky, Penny! Our family has a SECRET SANTA!
- Every night until Christmas, someone is going to leave goodies at our front door!
- But we mustn't try to see who it is, or it will spoil the fun! Isn't it exciting?!
- I'll hide in the bushes, you guys hide behind the trash cans! Roger! Some of us might be a little TOO excited!",dr091214
"- What a waste of an evening!
- We hid outside to catch our secret Santa, but no one ever showed up! Yes they did!
- They left a plate of brownies at our BACK door three hours ago!
- Our secret Santa outsmarted us! THIS MEANS WAR!",dr091215
"- Someone is approaching our house, dad! It could be our secret Santa! Roger!
- GOTCHA!!
- False alarm. It was just Norman getting the mail!",dr091216
"- Our secret Santa is approaching our front door!
- WE GOT HIM!!!
- STEINBAUER?? Season's greetings to you too, Ralph!",dr091217
"- Steinbauer! YOU'RE our secret Santa??!
- YOU'RE the one who's been leaving goodies at my front door every night?? That's right, Ralph!
- I thought, what better way to enjoy the holidays than by showing kindness to someone I don't like very much!
- What's there not to like about ME?? Well, take this net, for example.",dr091218
"- Daddy, when I grow up, I'm going to marry someone just like you!
- Really, Penny? That's nice of you to say!
- Only he's going to be taller and smarter and a little better looking!
- OK, well, that's still nice of you to say! Actually, a lot better looking!",dr091219

- Hey, don't pull the popcorn string out of the Christmas tree!
- GIVE ME THAT!! Humans love to play. You've just got to find the right toy!",dr091220
"- The mail arrived!
- Oh look! My mother sent a Christmas card to Oogie!
- She did WHAT??! Look, Oogie! Isn't it adorable?!
- There are three stages of life: youth, middle age , and I-send-Christmas-cards-to-cats!",dr091221
"- Arf arf arf! Arf arf arf! Arf arf arf! Arf arf!
- SLAM!
- I told you we should've sung ""silent night"". Not everyone enjoys the barking version of ""Jingle Bells""!",dr091222
"- You kids did a fine job of decorating the tree this year!
- Bob makes an excellent tree-topper! I should have migrated when I had the chance!",dr091223
"- Come on, Norm! It's your turn!
- Hurry up!
- Look! A see a red light in the sky! It must be Rudolph! Aren't we getting a little old for this? Yes, but your dad isn't!",dr091224
"- Thanks for all the gifts, mom and dad! I can't believe how much we got!
- When's easter?",dr091225
"- Dear Mr. Claus,
- It has come to my attention that you left one less item in my stocking than you left for my brothers.
- I'm sure it was just an oversight and that you will want to rectify it a.s.a.p
- Penny, I'm so proud of you for writing your thank-you notes early! A pair of socks does not count as two items.",dr091226
"-
- I hate these plastic bags!
- WHIFF-IFF-IFF
- I can never pull them apart!
- RIP!
- And then I can never get them open!
- RIP! tear! tear! shred! shred! RIP!
- I'll bet that's why most people don't eat enough fruits and vegetables!",dr091227
"- Dear aunt Wanda, thank your for the nutcracker.
- When we told you we like nutcrackers many years ago, we never expected that you'd give us one every year!
- We now have more nutcrackers than we have NUTS to CRACK! I'm SICK of them!!!
- On second thought, I'll write the thank you notes. I was just getting warmed up!",dr091228
"- I'm writing a thank you notice to Bruce and Pat!
- Five pages?? That's not a note, that's a term paper!
- Isn't that a little bit long for a thank you notice?
- Of course, I'm talking to someone who leaves 20-minute messages on answering machines!",dr091229
"- Good boy, Ralph!
- This ice cream has been here for a week, and you haven't touched it!
- Congratulation on your self-control!
- Actually, I've replaced it five minutes!",dr091230
"- Are you making any new year resolutions, Wally?
- I'm going to quit barking my head off every time I hear a knock at the door!
- I resolve to become less superstitious.
- ...knock on wood! Arf! Arf! Arf! ARF! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! ARF!",dr091231
"- It's a cold, windy day for a parade!
- Hurry! Tie the rope around his leg!! I am not a runaway balloon!",dr100101
"- OH, for heaven's sake!
- We have a new television, but I'm afraid to turn it on!
- It seems like there's always something violent and bloody on every channel!
- May that's why they're called plasma TVs!",dr100102
"- What did you lose now, son?
- I can't find my library card!
- Oh, for Pete's sake, Norm! You need to become more responsible!
- You're getting to big for this!
- You're always losing things! It shows a lack of focus!
- Take CARE of your things! Remember, there's a place for everything, so keep everything in its...
- By the way, I found your car keys in the refrigerator!
- Sometimes I'm glad that my kids tend to ignore me!",dr100103
"- Dad, I got into a little fender bender.
- But I have a good excuse!
- I was texting. Why is that a good excuse?
- It's hard to do two things at once! My son, the crash-text dummy!",dr100104
"- My new year's resolution was to stop barking my head off whenever someone knocks on the door!
- How's it going?
- So far, so good.
- Nobody's knocked on the door!",dr100105
"- Gulp!
- crick!
- RATTA-TATTA-TAT
- It's always a little painful to get the December credit card bills!",dr100106
"- There's nothing like putting on a warm pair of sweatpants!
- As soon as they cool off, I like to throw them into the dryer and heat them back up!
- That's fine when you're at HOME! Ahhhh! LAUNDROMAT",dr100107
"- I got a 99 on my exam, dad! Good for you, Patrick!
- Did YOU ever get a 99 on an exam?
- Sure! Many times!
- Having your temperature taken is not an exam. Then no.",dr100108
"- Norm! I thought I told you to take out the trash!
- Don't worry, dad. I'm all over it!
- The only thing he's ever been all over is the furniture!",dr100109
"- Dad, I've been doing a lot of thinking...
- So I'm going to lie down for a while! That's my boy!",dr100110
"- Ralph! Come quick!! What's wrong?
- Oogie is stuck in a tree!
- She can't get down! She can't come inside!
- Aren't you going to DO something?! I was considering a cartwheel!",dr100111
"- I know how to rescue Oogie! I'll call 911! Don't do that, honeybunch!
- Why not? If we don't, we might never see Oogie again!
- Honeybunch, the paramedics are too busy helping injured people! They don't have time to rescue a dumb cat!
- Besides, why mess with a good thing? Maybe when they come here to help YOU, they'll rescue Oogie, too!",dr100112
"- How will we get Oogie down from that tree, mom?
- I have an idea: Oogie always comes running when I turn on the can opener!
- WHIRRRRRR
- My mistake. It's your father who always comes running! What are we having??",dr100113
"- Honeybunch! What are you DOING?? If YOU won't rescue Oogie, *I* will!
- OK, OK...I'll get the stupid cat out of the tree!
- Dad, I insist you be careful! Hold on tight and don't fall!
- But let me get the video camera just in case!",dr100114
"- Almost there...
- The ladder is bending!
- SNAP!
- Hisss! What a cheap ladder! I'll be taking it back to the store!",dr100115
"- I can't believe our ladder broke in half! What poor quality!
- Don't worry, Ralph! I'm going to take it back to the hardware store and make them replace it!
- I'll wait here. bat bat Keep Oogie company!",dr100116
"- Supermarket Honeybunch, I think I'll buy these new diet pills I've seen advertised on TV!
- Careful, Ralph. Always check the label first for any possible side effects!
- Sometimes the side effects are worse than the problem!
- ""Side effects may include irritability, hairloss, watery eyes...""
- ""insomnia, muscle ache, join pain, gas, bloating, lethargy, thirst...""
- !itchy skin, nausea, excessive sweating, dizziness, blurred vision, drowsiness, and feelings of inadequacy and helplessness.""
- Perfect! I've already got all those things, anyway!",dr100117
"- Why are you sitting in a tree, Ralph?
- If you must know, Steinbauer, I climbed up to rescue our dumb cat, and the ladder broke!
- That's too bad! Would you like to borrow *MY* ladder? Yes! I'd LOVE to!
- Well, you never returned my socket wrench, so tough tacos! What a guy! Hiss!",dr100118
"- What luck. I climb up here to rescue our stupid cat, and the ladder breaks!
- Now I can only sit here and wait for my wife to get another one! pick pick purrrrrr
- What could be worse than being stuck in a tree with only a cat? Tweet! I had to ask! Grrrr!",dr100119
"- SWIPE!
- Good news, dad! Mom took the broken ladder back to the store and they replaced it! She's on her way home!
- Tell her to step on it!! This cat is obnoxious! I have to get done from this tree before I go insane!!!
- She says it's too late for that! My wife puts ""art"" in SMART ALECK!",dr100120
"- Dad, I have an idea!
- I'm throwing a rope over the branch above you...
- OK! Are you ready? FOR WHAT?
- Actually, I'm not exactly sure yet! The five words that frighten me the most: ""Dad, I have an idea!""",dr100121
"- Put Oogie in the kitty carrier, ad I'll lower her down!
- Kitty carrier?? Isn't that the box we use to take Oogie to the vet?
- WAIT! DON'T LET HER SEE THAT BOX OR SHE'LL GO...
- RIP! SHRED! CLAW! SCRATCH TEAR! SLASH!
- Ballistic.",dr100122
"- I'm back with the ladder!
- Hey! You're out of the tree! When it started snowing, the additional weight caused our branch to break!
- Fortunately, Norman had time to shovel a giant snow pillow beneath me to cushion my fall. Was I really gone that LONG?
- I almost fell bad that I stopped to get my nails done!",dr100123
"- RING! Hello! Drabble Residence! Patrick speaking!
- ...Norman? No, he can't talk right now!
- His tongue is caught in an ice cream scooter! AN EXTHPLANATION ITH NOT NETHETHARY!",dr100124
"- ...oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry to hear that they're not getting along.
- Ralph and I have a rule in our marriage...
- We never go to sleep angry!
- Isn't that right, Ralph? Wha...?",dr100125
"- RRIPP! YEEOOWW!! Thanks, guys!
- OK, but the next time you get a lint roller stuck on your hairy back, don't call 911! I thought he was wearing an Alpaca sweater!",dr100126
"- Turn left at Ernie's Donuts.
- Turn right at Jose's Pizza, and left at Pancake Palace.
- Make a legal u-turn at Fred's Frozen Yogurt. Then veer left at Tiny's Tacos.
- You have an interesting GPS! Slow down! There's the pancake house! It gets me where I want to go!",dr100127
"- KNOCK KNOCK
- BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK!!
- Relay, Wally! We've never had an evil intruder knock on our door!
- I must be doing a good job!",dr100128
"- Let's see what my fortune cookie says...
- A partner's hip will prove to be exciting.
-
- Oh, my mistake... ""A PARTNERSHIP...""",dr100129
"- You should enjoy these years, mom.
- Before you know it, I'll be all grown up!",dr100130
"- Norman, you dress like a nobody! You need to sell yourself a little better!
- What do you mean, dad? Well, take this for example...what am I holding?
- An apple? Wrong!
- It's a RED DELICIOUS apple! It says so at the store!
- Notice how they didn't call it a RED SO-SO apple, or a RED FAIRLY TASTY apple! It's a RED DELICIOUS apple!
- Do you understand what I'm saying, Norm?
- No. ...Sigh...
- In a world of red delicious apples, my son is a kumquat!",dr100131
"- I don't understand it...
- My mother looks bad in every one of these photos!
- And what don't you understand about it, exactly?
- Wives: They want you to communicate, then they don't want you to communicate!",dr100201
"-
-
-
- I don't see any warpath, dad!",dr100202
"- Norm, some people are ""Type A"" personalities. They are driven to succeed! text text
- Other people have ""Type B"" personalities. They are slightly less ambitious!
- What type of personality am I, dad? It's hard to say, Norm.
- The alphabet only goes down to *Z*! text text",dr100203
"- Don't take this the wrong way, Ralph...
- I know how defensive you get whenever I offer a little constructive criticism.
- So don't get all bent out of shape and act like a baby like you always do, all right?
- We haven't even gotten to the CRITICISM yet!",dr100204
"-
-
-
- Why, exactly, DO you watch these medical shows? The surgical procedures are fascinating!",dr100205
"- Kendall's dad works for a sporting goods company. He always brings his kids cool stuff from work!
- Did you bring ME anything home from work, dad?
- Patrick, I'm a security guard at a retirement village!

- No, it isn't! That was MUCH too late!!",dr100209
"- How does the mall directory always know where I'm standing??
- Oh, wait...I get it!
- Sorry! I guess that was one of my dumber questions!
- Actually, that's not even CLOSE to being one of your dumber questions!",dr100210
"- I'm feeling a little light-headed!
- That's understandable.
-
- There's not much in there to weigh it down! I GOT IT ALREADY!",dr100211
"-
- pat pat pat pat
- Does this look like a pancreas to you? Close enough. When Patrick builds a snowman, he goes a little overboard.",dr100212
"- Happy Valentine's Day, Honeybunch!
- Marrying you was the best decision you ever made for me.
- That's probably not good, either! In the long run, dad, BUYING a card might be less expensive!",dr100213
"- Patrick! Look at this highschool picture of dad!
- That's DAD???
- Wow! You were really in shape back then, dad!
- You better believe it, boys!
- In my younger days, I was a chick magnet!
- Now he's a refrigerator magnet!",dr100214
"- Here's a box of valentine candy, Norman! Foe ME?? Thank you, Wendy!
- I had an extra one and I couldn't find anyone else to give it to. How thoughtful!
- The mailman is on a diet, the guy in the toll booth is allergic... I'm touched!
- Hey, maybe my insurance agent would like it! Thank you for thinking of me momentarily!",dr100215
"- Who is Babe Ruth?!!
- Sorry, honeybunch! I know it's rude to blurt out answers while watching ""Jeopardy.""
- That's OK, Ralph.
- You're never right, anyway! The correct answer is: ""Who is Ghandi?"" Dang!",dr100216
"- An empty ice cream carton??
- Ralph, did you forget about your diet?? You're not supposed to eat ice cream!!
- I didn't eat it, honeybunch! That's true, Mom!
- He put it in the microwave and drank it!",dr100217
"- Here's the mail, honeybunch! Is that all?
- Yes. I threw away all the junk mail!
- If you threw away all the junk mail, how come you didn't throw away this ad inviting me to join a weight-loss program?
- Do you think I'm fat? This would be a good time to fake an appendix attack!",dr100218
"- Ralph, you said you threw away all the junk mail...
- But you DIDN'T throw away this ad inviting me to join a weight-loss program.
- I'll ask you one more time: do you think I'm fat?
- Uhhh... The correct answer to that does not begin with ""uhhh""!",dr100219
"- Ralph, I'm going to ask you only one more time...
- Why did you give me this ad for a weight-loss program?? Honeybunch, I can explain.
- HONK! HONK! HONK! Whoa! Our car is honking! I'll go investigate!!
- Now I know why they put the red button on the keyless remote!",dr100220
"- Hang on a second, Meg! Ralph is leaving for work! Bye, Ralph. Bye, honeybunch!
- Hold on, he's back! Sorry! I forgot my wallet!

- Something wrong, dad? I'll give you a dollar to go inside and get my car keys!",dr100221
"- The kids are all gone, Ralph! Huh??
- Norm is at the movies, Patrick is at a birthday party, and Penny is at grandma's!
- Do you know what that means? We have the house to ourselves!
- I think it also means I'm not going to get to watch wrestling tonight! We can play a board game or take a walk or watch a chick flick or...",dr100222
"- Since it's just two of us tonight, Ralph, let's play a game like Parcheesi! PARCHEESI?!
- How about if we just watch a little TV? OK! Let's see what's on!
- Oh, I love this interior design show! And there's a love story on the classic movie channel!
- Parcheesi it is! Oh, the bachelor show is on!!",dr100223

- Are you trimming your toenails while you're eating dinner??

"- Welcome to Wobbly Heights Retirement Village!
- I'll be glad when the repairman gets here!",dr100301
"- Before I head for home, I'd better listen to the traffic report!
- All freeways are clear, except for the Harbor Freeway, which is jammed! That's good to know!
- Honeybunch said if I'm late, she's going to the opera without me.
- The Harbour Freeway, it is!",dr100302
"- Every time you go to the store, you sure buy a lot of stuff!
- Do we really NEED all of those things?
- you have to distinguish between WANTS and NEEDS!

- Never mind! text text text!",dr100307
"- Well, it's the start of another little league baseball season...
- A time when a big career is the dream of every child.
- ...and quite a few of their parents! Swing level, keep your eye on the ball, and remember that the average major league salary is over $3 million!",dr100308
"- Patrick, if you're going to be a baseball player, you'll need all the proper accessories!
- First, you'll need to get some of this black stuff to put on your cheeks!
- What for? So the glare doesn't get in your eyes and cause you to drop the ball!
- But if I DON'T use it, at least I'll have an EXCUSE for dropping the ball! Good point. Let me think about that...",dr100309
"- Come on, Patrick! Get it over the plate!
- I think you're being unrealistic, dad! I just can't do it!
- Keep trying! Do you know how much money a left-handed pitcher can make??!
- I KEEP TELLING YOU, I'M NOT LEFT-HANDED!! That's why you need to keep practicing!",dr100310
"- Here's another great thing about little league season...
- It gives us the opportunity to get to know other parents!
- People we might not otherwise have gotten the chance to know!
- Like that windbag down the street, or the raving lunatic around the corner, or the dirty rotten cheater across town...",dr100311
"- I know we can improve your little league team, Patrick...
- Make a trade for that kid named Longville! He's really good!
- His dad's the coach of his team! What kind of dad would trade away his own son??
- I did, once. And I've never forgiven you!",dr100312
"- STRIKE THREE??
- THAT PITCH WAS A MILE OUTSIDE, UMP!!!
- YOU NEED GLASSES, YOU... I'm back from the snack bar!
- Phffmmf! There's a reason baseball and hot dogs go together!",dr100313
"- Let's go! We're going to be late! It's almost nine o'clock!
- Really? It doesn't seem it's nine o'clock! That's because I set our clocks ahead one hour last night!
- You did?? I set them ahead an hour, too!
- I couldn't remember if we were supposed to move our clocks UP an hour or BACK an hour, so I moved some of them up and some of them back.
- I couldn't remember, either, so I just set them all ahead twenty minutes!
- I hate it when daylight-saving time begins! Don't worry. We usually get it all straightened out by mid-april! I hope it's still Sunday!",dr100314
"- OK, I picked up the dry cleaning!
- Let's go! I'm in a hurry! Sorry, dad. We can't leave yet.
- Why not? Because I parked in a space that said ""30 minute parking only"".
- We've only been here four and a half minutes! WILL YOU START THE CAR!!",dr100315

- Nothing.
- Then why are you staring at it?
- What's in the refrigerator, dad? Nothing.",dr100318

- You know, she's right!
-",dr100319
"- I think I'm losing my mind!
- Has anyone seen my glasses? I can't find my glasses!!
- You're not losing your mind. They're right on top of your head!
- Those aren't mine! OK, maybe he IS losing his mind!",dr100320
"- Sorry, honeybunch, but I just can't take you to see that new chick flick! Why not?

- But, instead of going on a diet, I've decided to just hang around people who are more out of shape than I am!
- So, where are we going now? WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?!!",dr100323

- But at least I can say one thing...
- I'm a self-made man!

"- You men do such a fine job of guarding our community! Have a cup-cake!
- Thanks, Mrs. Alabaster! No thank you!
- Trying to loose weight, Ralph? Not really...
- At this point, it's more of a matter of damage control!",dr100326
"- After a hard day at work, it's nice to be greeted at the front door by our faithful dog!
- I'm home!
- And your point is...? Being greeted by the cat is not quite the same!",dr100327
"- I'm gonna throw the ball, Wally!
- Go get it!
- Hee hee!

- It's fun to fake out a dog!
- Well?! Why are you just standing around?? You acted like you needed to go for a walk outside! I'm getting drenched! It's fun to fake out people, too!",dr100328

- My friends already know where to find me!
- I know, but sometimes the frozen yogurt shop is closed! I was thinking of the driving range, smarty!",dr100802
"- You'll enjoy being on this social networking site, Ralph!
- It's a great way to reconnect with long lost friends!
- Why would I want to do that?
- There's a reason why some long-lost friends become long lost!",dr100803
"- OK, Ralph, now we need to fill out your profile! What's your favorite TV show?
- ""The Munsters"". OK, What's your favorite movie?

- You're right. I'm sorry! The best defense is a good offense!",dr100820
"- Aren't you a little embarrassed that he puts a leash on you to go for a walk?

"- Norm, as you prepare to leave home to go live at college, you may be having second thoughts.
- But let me remind you of one thing...
- Today is the first day of the rest of my life!
- That's nice, dad. Maybe I could turn your room into a home theater!",dr100831
"- We always knew the day would come when you left home, Norman.
- You poor father is taking it very hard!
- I even saw a tear in his eye!
- Actually, that's just sweat from moving the pool table into my room! Oh yeah, huh!",dr100901
"- I'm going to miss you, big brother! Me too!
- You're the best big brother in the world! What about me?
- You're the ten BILLIONTH best big brother in the world! Well, you're the ten ZILLIONTH best little sister!
- MOM! PATRICK IS BEING MEAN!! AM NOT! I'll miss you guys, too!",dr100902
"- Well, I guess this is it, Norm. You're really leaving home.
- Living at the dorm will be a great adventure! Just be careful and make wise choices!
- Oh, and one more thing...
- DON'T GO!!",dr100903
"- I can't believe this! It's finally happening! Our little boy is leaving home!

- THREE of us? You, me and my pet duck!",dr100906
"- So, what's your major, Norman? I'm still undecided.
- What do you want to do for a living? I'd like to be a LEGO sculptor!
- A LEGO sculptor? Yeah! Check out this amazing likeness of Abe Lincoln!
- It looks like a battleship! Really? Wow, I have even more talent than I thought.",dr100907
"- How about you, Elgin? What are you studying? I'm a music major.
- I aspire to become a professional vuvuzelist!

- Catchy! I hope my practicing won't keep you awake at night!",dr100908
"- I can't believe Norman has left home!
- What an adjustment! It already seems so different around here! That's true...
- Hey! Who tracked in mud?! Uhhh...
- It must have been you! Now there's one less person I can blame things on!",dr100909
"- I can't believe our oldest child has left home! Before you know it, we'll be emptynesters!
- Patrick, don't ever grow up and leave home, OK?
- You mean you want me to never become self-reliant and mature? You want me to be dependent on my parents forever?
- If you wouldn't mind! Let me get back to you on that!",dr100910
"- It's strange...
- Norman hasn't even been gone a whole day, and the house already seems different!
- I know...
- Instead of having 3 TVs on with nobody watching them, we only have *2* TVs on with nobody watching them!",dr100911
"- What flavor are you going to get, dad? Hmmm...
- How about chocolate? Absolutely not!
- Strawberry? Nope. Bad idea!
- Orange? Peanut butter fudge? Nope! No way!
- Better make it banana! Banana??
- Why banana? The color of my yogurt always has to match my shirt!",dr100912
"- Norman has only been gone since this morning, but I already miss him! Me too, honeybunch!
- By deciding to live at college, at least he's proven that he's growing up!
-
- What are YOU doing back here?? Since college isn't that far away, I figured I'd sleep here at night!",dr100913
"- Norman, you can't sleep here every night! We've already paid for your dorm!!
- Grow up and show some independence!
- Let go of your mom's apron strings!
- And let go of my sweatpants strings, too!",dr100914
"- Norman, you can't sleep here every night! We've already paid for your dorm!
- But I've never slept away from home, dad!
- I'd never be able to sleep at college!
- You sleep at college all the time! Yeah, but that's in the daytime!",dr100915
"- ...and then they lived happily ever after.
- Goodnight, Norman!
- 'nite, dad! Of all the roommates I could have gotten this semester, I had to get him!",dr100916

- All Books Shelved By Author. Wow!
- It's not enough that they WRITE the books, they also have to SHELVE them, too?",dr100917

- Wash the car, paint the fence, trim the trees...
- You gave me a list of chores to do?? Happy Saturday!",dr100918

- Hi! GAAAAHH!!
- Goodness, you're jumpy! You need to cut back on the frosted cereal!",dr100922
"- Go ahead and respond to your high school sweetheart, Ralph! What's the harm? Don't do it!!
- If your wife finds out, it could damage your relationship!! How would she ever know?
- Ralph, did you eat the entire bag of cookies and then replace them with a new bag, thinking I wouldn't notice?!
- Trust me, she'll know!",dr100923
"- An old flame sent me a Facebook message. It's best to let sleeping dogs lie, Ralph!
- You're right! I'll ignore her 'friend' request! Smart man!
- I'll click 'ignore' right now! Here I go! I'm going to click 'ignore'! Ready, ONE...TWO...THREE.
- ...four...five...six...seven... WILL YOU CLICK IT, ALREADY?!",dr100924
"- My old high school sweetheart contacted me on Facebook! She asked me if I was married!
- Maybe she still has feelings for me! Maybe she wants to apologize for dumping me! Maybe...
- Blink! Hey! She just sent me another message!
- I asked if you were married because I now sell cosmetics! Tell your wife to check out my new website!",dr100925
"- I'm going to the store, honeybunch!
- OK! I'm going to the gym!
- While you're there, see if they have any exercise machines to tighten your abs!

- Do I even want to know what you did? Probably not!",dr101019
"- Norman, why are you in the mall jail?! What did you do??!
- I went snorkeling in the fountain! That's not so bad!

- And I rode the escalator without holding the handrail! Whoa! Now you're looking at hard time!",dr101020

"- Dad, I'm in show business! I'm going to be in the ""Pageant of the Painters"". What's that?
- It's a show where great works of art are recreated on stage using actors!
- I'm going to play George Washington crossing the Delaware!
- All I have to do is stand perfectly still like this for two minutes! You've always had a talent for standing around doing nothing!",dr110614
"- Dad, I need to rehearse for my part in the ""Pageant of the Painters"".

- OK, that's enough! I'm tired. How long was that? Four seconds.",dr110615
"- Son, normally I'd think a job where all you have to do is stand still and do nothing would be right up your alley.
- But I'm a little worried about it!
- Relax, dad! What could possibly go wring? Well...
- Hold that thought! I suddenly have to go to the bathroom!",dr110616
"- This show is great! I can't believe how they depict famous works of art using live models!

- You need to show more confidence in your son! OK, I'm CONFIDENT he's going to mess it all up somehow!",dr110617
"- ""Washington crosses the Delaware"" will be the next painting after the intermission!

"- Dad, I'm performing a living depiction of ""Washington Crossing the Delaware""...
- Don't worry about me! All I have to do is stand perfectly still for two minutes!
- Why wouldn't I be able to stand still for that long??
- After I finish my big-swig, I'll be ready to go!",dr110621
"- Dad, there's no need to worry about me! I'll only be on stage for 2 minutes!
- All I have to do is stand perfectly still! What could possibly go wrong?
- ACHOO!
- Darned allergies!",dr110622

- So I'm going to propose to echo! WHAT?? You were right about that ""life is short"" part!",dr120123

"- Don't worry, dad! I've got it all planned down to the smallest detail...
- Echo and I will have dinner at our favorite place, the Bulk Club Food Court.
- After we finish our churro, I'll get down on one knee and and pop the question! She'll cry with joy!
- I never knew you were so romantic! I even bought a pen with a heart on top for her to sign the pre-nup agreement!",dr120126
"- Echo, we have so much in common! We get along so well together...
- I have an important question to ask you...
- Will you please be mine? Nope.

"- Every father should practice his glare!
- If you have a good glare, your kids are more apt to be good, because they don't want you to give them that look!
- Sometimes I give my kids the glare BEFORE they can get into trouble, just as a precaution!
- In fact, something tells me this would be a good time to give Norman the glare, but he already left on a date!

- Right this way, ma'am! Your seat is down on the field-level! Nice!
- And your seat is in the upper deck! WHAT?!!",dr120508
"- Can you see me, Echo? I'm in the last row!
- Yeah! I can't believe our seats are in different sections!
- I guess I should've looked more closely before I bought the tickets!
- That scalper seemed like such a nice guy!",dr120509
"- How do you like your seat, Norman?
- I hate it because it's not next to YOUR seat!
- ...it's also in the top row of the upper deck, and my view is obstructed by the foul pole.
- And I'm sitting between two drunken fans who are rooting for different teams!
- With my luck, this game will go extra innings!",dr120510
"- I seem to be sitting in the PWDY section!
- That's too bad! Everyone around me is very nice!
- The view is great from here! It sure is!
- TALL THAT GUY NEXT TO YOU TO KEEP HIS EYES ON THE GAME!",dr120511
"- I'm in the top deck and you're down below! I can't believe I paid for seats that aren't together!
- I'm really sorry, Echo! I feel like I've ruined our date!
- If it makes you feel better, I'm having a nice time anyway!
- Why would that make me feel better?",dr120512
"- Happy mother's day, Honeybunch!
- Thank you, Ralph! What a nice card!
- Did you read it?
- Of course I read it! How else would I know which card to buy you?
- What did it say?
- ""USA $2.99, Canada $3.99""",dr120513
"- Norman, guess what! The guy next to me caught a foul ball and GAVE it to me!
- That's what *I* wanted to do!! I wanted to catch a ball and give it to YOU and be a HERO! That's why I brought my GLOVE!!
- Instead, I'm sitting between two drunks in the last row of the upper deck!
- The only thing I'm going to catch up here is PNEUMONIA! He didn't bring a glove. He caught it bare-handed!",dr120514
"- I bought baseball tickets for Echo and me, but the seats weren't together! Pucker Up! It's the KISS CAM
- She's downstairs next to a guy who's flirting with her, and I'm in the upper deck between two drunks!
- It can't get much worse than this!
- I stand corrected! KISS CAM *",dr120515
"- I can't believe it!!
- Echo's on the 'Kiss Cam' with that guy who's been flirting with her!! KISS CAM
- Is she going to kiss him?? What's going to happen???
- STOP DOING THE WAVE! I CAN'T SEE!!",dr120516
"- WHAT HAPPENED?! I COULDN'T SEE! DID SHE KISS HIM??
- !!* That girl on the kiss cam! Did she kiss him??! @*!!!
- WILL YOU DRUNKS SHUT UP AND GET A LIFE!!!
- Just kidding!",dr120517
"- Did you just call us DRUNKS? I don't recall. Hic!
- ALL RIGHT, BREAK IT UP! Thank goodness! Security has arrived! LET'S GO, TROUBLEMAKER! ME?? I'm not the DRUNK! All I've had is a FROZEN MALT!",dr120518
"- Hello, Echo? I'm embarrassed to tell you they just threw me out of the stadium!
- I told off those obnoxious drunks, and got ejected for causing a disturbance!
- That's OK, Norman. I got thrown out, too! WHY??!
- When that guy tried to kiss me on the 'Kiss Cam', I punched him in the nose!",dr120519
"- So, what do you do, young man? I'm a student.
- snip snip snip!

"- There! I just adjusted the clock on your dashboard! Why??
- It was an hour off! You never changed it for daylight saving time a couple of months ago!
- So what? I always knew what time it was because I knew it was one hour later than what the clock said!
- Well, now the time is correct! But now I'll always be an hour EARLY for everything!!",dr120523
"- Norman, why did you change the clock in my car??
- It was an hour slow! You never reset it for daylight saving time two months ago!
- Why bother to do that??
- It was going to be correct again in four months!",dr120524
"- I wish you hadn't changed the clock, Norm!
- But it was an hour slow! The correct time is *3:00§, not *2:00*!
- Yeah, except now it says it's three AM instead of three PM!
- I don't know how to change the AM and PM! My clock used to be an hour off. Now it's TWELVE hours off!",dr120525
"- Summer is only three months long, dad...

- There's one sure-fire way to find out...
- rustle rustle
- Stay out of those potato chips! Never fails!",dr120527
"- Interesting. This can of cake frosting is only 100 calories per serving.
- There are 13 servings in this can. If I ate it for a midnight snack, it would be 1,300 calories!
- This other can is *140* calories per serving. That's a big difference!
- It's important to read the nutritional information if you're serious about losing weight!",dr120528
"- Snacking AGAIN?? You've been eating a lot today, Ralph!
- I eat when I'm worried.
- I have a lot hanging over my head these days!
- You have a lot hanging over your BELT, too!",dr120529
"- Honeybunch, here's an article from the paper you might be interested in...

"- ARRRGGH!
- I hate having to step over that stupid doggie gate!
- Can I make a suggestion?
- If you remove the gate, you won't have to step over it any more!
- And then I'd also be able to go in that room any time I wanted to sleep on the new couch or shred magazines!
- The gate stays.
- People are supposed to be very smart, but I just don't see it!",dr120610

"- I'm so proud of myself! The scale says I've lost five pounds!
- I know my dieting has been hard on you all, so tonight we'll celebrate with a pizza! Yes!

- Daddy, can I please have twenty dollars? Sure, Penny!
- She always buys me the nicest father day's gift!",dr120616
"- We're back, dad!
- Where did you go today?
- We had a picnic in the park, went on a nature hike, saw the flower fields, and then went over to Aunt Betty's house for dinner.
- What did YOU do all day, dad?
- Not much, I watched sports on TV, ate chips and junk, then took a nap!
- Basically, I just sat around all by myself in my underwear all day.
- Thanks for making this the best father's day ever!! Glad you enjoyed yourself!",dr120617

- Years of practice! ...and laziness!",dr120620
"- Hi, Norman. I just called because I was thinking of you.
- You were thinking of ME, Wendy? Why?? Today is the longest day of the year...
- Which always reminds me of the time you took me on a date to your grandma's house to watch home movies!
- Talk about a LONG DAY! It's nice to know she thinks of me once a year!",dr120621

- WALK?? I don't want to walk to the store!!
- You always buy a lot of stuff, and I'll have to carry a bunch of heavy old bags all the way home!
- I promise I won't buy much!
- See? All I'm buying is a birthday card!
- So how are you doing with that heavy old bag of yours?!
- We seem to be doing pretty good, don't we, honeybunch?! smooch!
- ...and then it got ugly.",dr120624

- I didn't eat lunch today, and I figured out it was now or never!",dr120625
"- It's weird...we've had this grandfather's clock for years.
- It chimes all the time, but I never hear it because I'm so used to it!
- Ralph, I've told you over and over, when you put your dirty socks in the hamper, make sure they're inside-out!
- Did someone just say something?",dr120626
"- Souvenirs Son, make sure you marry a woman with a common first name!

"- Dad! I got a summer job! I'm an actor! An actor??
- You tried that last summer when you landed a role at the PAGEANT OF THE PAINTERS!

- It's not MY fault my cell phone rang! No, but you didn't have to ANSWER it!",dr120702
"- I got an acting job at the Murder Mystery Diner Theater, dad! What's that?
- People come for dinner, but the waiters and some of the guests are really actors!

- Doesn't that sound like fun? Depends what they're having for dinner?",dr120703
"- The Mystery Diner Theatre is fun, dad! Actors pose as ordinary customers...
- During the meal, a 'whodunit' unfolds! Everyone is a suspect!
- I play TROY, the handsome newlywed who is madly in love with his new bride.
- ...or IS he? (insert ominous music here).",dr120704
"- So, you're playing a newlywed husband? That's right, dad.
- Who plays your wife? I don't know. I'm going to meet her this afternoon!

- WENDY?? Can I trade roles with someone?",dr120705

- 555-362*8*! The had a deal at the Taco Place! TWO-FOR-ONE!
- 555-3*241*! This is kind of fun!",dr120708
"- This murder dinner mystery cruise will be so much fun, Ralph!
- Some of the diners are really actors, and during the meal, a mystery will unfold.
- Half the fun is trying to figure out who the actors are!
- I'm already a little suspicious of the astronaut!",dr120709
"- It's about time for us to go on, Norman! do you know your lines?
- Yes, but should we rehearse the kissing scene, Wendy? NO!
- By the way, can I have a breath mint? Sure, but you don't need it!
- I know. here!",dr120710
"- Do you know all your lines, Norman? You have the main part-you play the murderer!
- Norman? Are you OK? Is it my imagination, or is the boat rocking?

- Oh, look, darling! There's our table! Don't I have an understudy?",dr120712
"- Norman looks kind of sickly! I'm sure it's all part of the act!
- Hello, everyone! We just got married!
- Kiss me, darling! Tell me you're as happy as I am!
- Bleah! Boy, he's a good actor! What kind of dinner show is this??",dr120713
"- Norman, it's YOU LINE! Say something!
- Ladies, and gentlemen, I have a confession to make! I am the murderer!

- He puts his sunglasses on top of his head. That shows insecurity. He's afraid to move them too far from his face!
- This guy hangs them on the front of his shirt. That shows confidence!
- This man puts them on the back of his collar. That means he's hiding something!

- Thank you! I am humbled to receive this award!
- I'll put it next to my Mall Cop of the Year award and my Security Guard of the Year Award!
- OH YEAH! WHO DA MAN?!! Yeah, that seems to have humbled him!",dr120823
"- Thank you for this award, but there is a man who deserves it more than I do.
- A man who is overlooked year after year, but is a shining example of professionalism!
- It's high time we recognize him and give him the credit he deserves...
- SPANKY HERRERA! TAKE A BOW, SPANKY! ...Sigh... CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP",dr120824
"- ...and in conclusion, I'd like to acknowledge the other person...
- He is one of the best airport security screeners around! He taught me everything I know...

- Unfortunately, No-Neck's speech was so long, everyone else went home! Give him a big hand!",dr120825
"- Hi, mom! It's me!
- I just wanted to call and say thank you for the wonderful birthday gifts!
- I love the shirt that says ""I'm with stupid"".
- And ate ""I'm with stupid"" cap.

- And so is the ""I'm with stupid"" mug!

"- I've come down to the pawn shop today to try to sell a rare item!
- Hello! I have a rare historical artifact that I would be willing to sell for the right price!
- It is so valuable, I locked it inside this briefcase, and handcuffed it to my wrist!
- Unfortunately, I also locked the keys inside, so you'll have to take my word for it! They all come here.",dr120827
"- So, what did you want to sell? I have in my possession the signature of Abraham Lincoln!
- If it's authentic, it could be quite valuable! It's authentic, all right!
- Is it signed in a book? Or on a letter? Or on a document of some kind? Even better...
- He signed a baseball!",dr120828
"- What would make you think that Abraham Lincoln signed a baseball?
- He probably threw out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game!
- The Washington Nationals weren't around when Lincoln was president! Oh, yeah, huh!
- Then it must have been the Washington Senators!",dr120829
"- Where did you get this baseball signed by Abraham Lincoln? I bought it at a garage sale!
- I immediately recognized the historical significance, and I negotiated the price down to $250!
- I've never seen Lincoln's signature on a major league baseball!
- I've also never seen it signed with a ballpoint pen! The value keeps rising!",dr120830
"- So you paid $250 at a garage sale for a baseball signed by ABRAHAM LINCOLN??
- That's right, and I'll sell it to you right now for $100,000!
- Do you mind if I call in a buddy of mineto look at it? Is he a handwriting expert?
- No, but he could use a good laugh! Make it snappy before my price goes up!",dr120831
"- I hate to tell you, but this baseball was NOT signed by Abraham Lincoln. WHAT??
- It HAS to be real! I paid $250 for it at a garage sale!!
- Trust me, Abraham Lincoln NEVER signed this baseball! DANG!
- I was afraid to ask him about my hockey puck signed by General Custer!",dr120901

"- Today is traditionally the last day of summer!

"- It's important to prepare for a disaster BEFORE it happens!
- What would you do if your water supply was cut off?
- No problem! I've got a 100-foot hose. I'd just attach it to my neighbor's spigot, and take all the water I want!
- That might not work, Steinbauer! It DOES work! How do you think I keep my water bills so low?!",dr121114
"- To prepare for a disaster, we should all have a six-month supply of food in our garage!

- Come to think of it, it's more like a TWO-month supply!
- I've been doing some snacking! No wonder you spend so much time in the garage!",dr121115
"- The key to surviving a disaster is having neighbors who care about one another!
- Speaking of that, did you ever find a job, Sulpherdale? As a matter of fact, I did.

- Well, maybe YOU should buy a muzzle for your stupid dog! Whose dog are you calling stupid?!! This disaster meeting is a disaster!",dr121116

- She's pretty good! Hey, one of those goals was just LUCK!",dr121119
"- Remember, Norman, if we lose this game, we're out of the playoffs!
- There's no tomorrow! It's do or die!
- If you play as poorly against Echo's team as you did last time, we'll cut you from the team and never speak to you again!
- Thanks for the pep talk. And we'll pop your innertube!",dr121120
"- Hey, Echo, you know how you scored 17 goals against me last game? *18*, but who's counting?
- This time, don't try so hard to score on me, OK? Why?? That would be patronizing!
- I'd be treating you as an inferior! You wouldn't want me to do that, would you?
- Well? WOULD YOU?? I'm thinking it over!",dr121121
"- I can't believe Norman asked me to go easy on him while he plays goalie!
- Why would he not want me to play to my full potential?
- It's just a game! Why would...
- Remember, Norman, if Echo scores another 17 goals against you, you're off the team!",dr121122
"- If I score a bunch of goals against Norman, they'll throw him off the team!
- But it wrong not to play to my full potential!
- SHOOT, ECHO! SHOOT!!
- NICE PASS! Whew!",dr121123
"- I have a wide open shot!
- If I score, Norman's tram will lose and he'll get the blame. If I DON'T shoot, everyone will know I took pity on him!
- There's only one thing to do!

- CO-ed intramural innertube water polo is not for the faint of heart!",dr121126
"- I've missed two shots in a row! What's going on here??
- Could it be that I'm subconsciously afraid to score because it would make Norman look like a bad goalie?
- No.
- I'm CONSCIOUSLY afraid of it!",dr121127
"- Norman, I overheard your teammates tell you they'd cut you from the team if I scored a bunch of goals.
- That's why I haven't been able to shoot straight today!
- GOOOAAALL!
- Whew! Now that I know what the problem is, I feel so much better! Crud!",dr121128
"- Oh, no! Echo is unstoppable! She scored 4 goals in 2 minutes!

- That's using your head! I still have a head?",dr121130

- Echo fired a last-second shot, and I blocked it with my head.
- That's not even the worst part!
- I also have a bad case of swim-cap hair!",dr121201

"- Listen to this...
- 86% of people who eat chocolate easter bunnies eat the ears first!

- Once again, you've proven my point!",dr130328
"- Aren't you excited, Penny?

"- Wally, go to bed!
- The easter bunny already came and hid the eggs!
- WHAT?? How did THAT happen?? I haven't taken my eyes off the front door for three hours!
- And I thought BADGERS were sneaky!",dr130330
"- OK, I'm ready!
- WHAP!

- Wendy told me I'd been selected grand marshal of the April Fool's Day parade...
- So I went all the way downtown, and found out there WAS no April Fool's Day parade!

- HEY!! It's always fun to play the ""fake-out"" game with Ralph! He's so gullible!",dr130407
"- A cat makes the very best pet, and this you must never forget.
- Dogs can be mean,
- but cats are serene.
- Except on the way to the vet!",dr130408
"- The reason that people love cats, is simple. Let's look at the stats.
- We sleep most of the day,
- We wake up just to play.
- And we make sure your house has no rats!",dr130409
"- People think cats are so dignified, we seem calm and collected inside.
- But when I went to the groomer
- He made me wish I'd left sooner. snip snip
- 'cause now I'm just fit to be tied!",dr130410
"- This new automatic soap dispenser is already broken!
- I keep putting my hand underneath it, but nothing happens!
- What a stupid invention! I hate modern technology! Why won't any soap come out??!
- That's the can opener.",dr130411
"- ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF! You dumb dog...

- What else can I find in here?
- How long ago was easter?",dr130413
"- rrroww!

"- Hey, Wally!
- Do you wanna...
- Go for a...
- Walk? You had me at the ""Hey, Wally""!",dr130415
"- I don't get it. Wally goes on the same walk every day...
- He sees the same things and sniffs the same things. sniff sniff
- What does he find so exciting about it?
- To him, it's a walk. To me, it's a badger hunt!",dr130416
"-
- It's called a ""LAPtop."" If I put it on my lap, I can't see it!",dr130417
"- I've seen that one, too!
- Which ones have you seen? That one and that one.
- OK, that was interesting!
- When he offered to take me to the movies, this wasn't what I had in mind! Want to look at some ice cream?",dr130418

- Try me! I know the location of EVERYTHING in this store!

- My husband! Aisle 9!
- How did you know? Just an educated guess that Ralph would be near the ice cream case! Marble fudge...cookie dough...chocolate chip...",dr130421
"- Why do we have to go to a WEDDING RECEPTION??
- Because it's you cousin's niece!
- Turn here. I think it's over there!
- Are you sure this is the right place? How many Poopsie and Choppers do you know?",dr130422
"- Oh, look! They have a book to sign and write a brief message!
- scribble scribble scribble scribble scribble scribble scribble

"- RELAX! I'LL BE THERE IN A SECOND!
- Betht wisheths! You're supposed to greet the newlyweds BEFORE you get your food!",dr130424
"- I hate social gatherings. Me too, son. It's hard for me to talk to strangers.
- But we need to make the effort! Everyone needs to step out of their comfort zone occasionally!
- That's my problem dad...
- I don't HAVE a comfort zone! MY comfort zone is the area around the dessert table!",dr130425
"- Social gatherings can be intimidating, son, but don't be shy!
- Put yourself out there! I want you to say hello to every person in this room!
- You can never embarrass yourself by being polite! Watch me...
- Hello, sir! I'm Ralph Drabble! And you are? The groom's mother!",dr130426

- WHO ATE THE CAKE I BAKED FOR MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY??
-",dr130428
"- Echo! Fancy meeting YOU here! Yes, I...
- WHOA!
- I just caught the bouquet! That means I'm going to be the next DRIVE!
- I'm glad *I* didn't catch it! You're funny, I'm hoping!",dr130429
"- Echo caught the bouquet. That means she'll be the next bride!
- I won't even try to catch the garter! That would be a little awkward!
- Rats!",dr130430
"- Look, Norman! The dance floor is empty!
- I don't know HOW to dance, Echo! I don't, either!
- Let's dance like the Peanuts characters in ""A Carlie Brown Christmas""!
- Good idea, Norman! You're the only person who ever says that, Echo!",dr130501
"- Look! Norman is dancing!
- He seems to have a lot in common with that girl!
- Yes, they seem perfect for each other!
- So, what do you think is going to go wrong? We'll probably find out before the night is over!",dr130502
"- I forgot to ask you, Echo...why are you here at the wedding reception?
- I'm related to the bride!
- I can't believe how much we have in common! I'm related to the bride, too!
-",dr130503
"- We're BOTH related to the bride??? What a coincidence!
- But if YOU'RE related to the bride, and I'M related to the bride...
- Then WE must be related!! Eww!
- I feel like Luke Skywalker when he found out Princess Leia was his sister! I'm throwing back the bouquet!",dr130504
"- Strike three!
- BOO! GIVE ME A BREAK, UMP! GET IN THE GAME, BLUE!
- How come little league parents always give the umpire such a hard time?
- Umpires do the best they can! If not for the umpire, the kids couldn't have a game!
- It's really true: the people who volunteer are always the most criticized!
- It's a great idea for the ump to take off his mask, hand it to the biggest loudmouth, and make THAT person do the umpiring until he apologizes!
- Definitely a good idea!
- Had enough? I'll never yell at you again!",dr130505
"- RELATED?? How can we be RELATED, Echo??
- I'm Poopsie's second cousin's half-sister's...
- step niece's brother-in-law's aunt's third husband's son-in-law's nephew's cousin once removed!
- And that makes you... More confused than usual!",dr130506
"- What's wrong, Norm? I received devastating news, dad!
- I just found out that the perfect girl is RELATED to me!
- She's Poopsie's second cousin's half-sister's step-niece's brother-in-law's aunt's third husband's son-in-law's nephew's cousin once removed!
- Bummer! Some things are just not meant to be!",dr130507
"- Norm, it's perfectly OK for you to date Echo!
- So what if she's Poopsie's second cousin's half sister's step-niece's...
- brother-in-law's aunt's third husband's son-in-law's nephew's cousin twice removed?
- She's ONCE removed. Oh, then forget it!",dr130508
"- Norman, you are NOT related to Echo! How do you know?
- We're not actually related to Poopsie! She's our cousin's STEP-niece! WOW!
- Imagine how happy Echo will be! She'll probably want to elope with you TONIGHT! Go tell her the good news!
- My little brother thinks we're related, too!",dr130509
"- scratch scratch Yawn!

- ...Sigh...
- It makes you wonder where the term ""immediate family"" ever came from!",dr130511
"- Happy Mother's Day, Mom! We made a card for you!
- When it comes to our mom, she is simply the best. Our mom always makes sure that we ace the test!
- She'll help us with homework for as long as we please. That's a good 'cause when dad helps, we only get ""C""s!
- For problems and quandaries no need to think twice. She always gives the very best fatherly advice!
- Now don't get us wrong, dad has his talents too. But the best thing he's done is say, ""I do"" to you!
- That's the best Mother's Day card ever! Sorry to throw you under the bus, dad! On Father's Day, just BUY me a card!",dr130512

"- Oof! AAAAAARRRGH!
- Got it!!
- If I'd known it was going to be that difficult, I wouldn't have asked you to pick up the crouton! Anything else you want me to do while I'm down here?",dr130515
"- What are you doing? We're making your father's day card, dad.
- We're trying to think of why you're the best dad in the world, and it's really hard!
- Good thing you're getting an early start! Father's day is a month away!
- We've been working on this since February!",dr130516
"- What time do we have to go to that stupid party tonight?
- 7:00! Dang. That's only three hours from now.

- Nobody wants to help strangers anymore!",dr130518
"- Oops!

- I dropped a jelly bean under the refrigerator!
- Now I have to try to knock it back out!
- Whoa!

- Yum! munch munch! ""SOMETHING ELSE""??!!",dr130519

"- All right, all right! Stop staring at me like that!
- You can come in!
-
- I hate to admit it, but you're starting to make me appreciate the cat! It was only a matter of time!",dr130521
"- An empty sack can be fun, the cat said.
- For one thing, it can be used as a bed!
- It's a good place to hide, a cat looks cool inside.
- Except when it gets stuck on his head! Dang!",dr130522
"- Oogie's head is stuck in a scak!
- Well, don't just stand there, DO something!!

- Not helpful!",dr130523

"- My family is gone for the evening! I can't believe it...
- I can have anything I want for dinner!
- No one to please but me! I can go anywhere and eat anything!
- I could go to the Bulk Club Food Court and have pizza and curros!
- Or I could go to the MiniMart and get a pastrami burrito and nachos!
- Or I could make myself a couple of peanut butter and chocolate chip sandwiches!
- Or I could have a box of donuts, or a carton of ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream and...

- Old! It's a good thing we're related! Otherwise we might have ended up married and looking like this!

- Echo, I have a confession to make... Quiet, you two! It's SHOWTIME!",dr130703

- That's actually kind of sweet!
- QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD, DUMMY! Allow me to elaborate!",dr130708
"- I owe an apology to to my friend, Echo! I will briefly explain why...
- It all started when we kept bumping into each other everywhere we went, so we figured it must be fate and we started hanging out together, and we soon realized that we had a lot in common so we started to like each other! But then we bumped into each other again at someone's wedding reception and we danced like the Peanuts characters, but then I told her we were related even though I knew we weren't, because...
- PING! OW!
- Did you just hit your brother with a pea? Yes, and you're welcome!",dr130709

- I suppose I can do that! Great!
- Take off your clothes. WHAT??!",dr130712
"- I'm back! I thought they were going to put you in the show!

"- Norm, I'd like you to be my caddy for the golf tournament! Why me?
- You can't overestimate the value of a good caddy!
- The caddy measures yardage, selects the club and offers advice!
- Yeah, and he also gets blamed when the golfer flubs a shot! Only in major tournaments!",dr130807
"- Good luck, Ralph! Try not to think about the fact that I'm the defending champion! Welcome To the EASTBAY OPEN
- As a token of my goodwill, have some new golf balls! Thanks, Steinbauer!

- Try it! What have you got to lose? My dignity and my mind!",dr130813

- * Looks like we made it... * WILL YOU QUIT SINGING BARRY MANILOW SONGS?!",dr130815
"- I have to admit, Norm, your strategy has worked!
- Golf is a mental game, and it's easy to let negative thoughts creep into your mind.
- Singing Barry Manilow songs is a great way to keep my mind unoccupied! There only seems to be one problem...
- It's hard to putt with tears in your eyes! * Oh, last night I said good-bye... * *",dr130816

- Count the clubs in Drabble's bag!
- ...13...14...*15*! WHAT?? I demand a RECOUNT!! Oh, yeah...I FOUND one!",dr130819
"- Since Ralph has an extra club in his bag, we'll have to give him a 2-stroke penalty!
- That means Steinbauer wins the tournament! YES! Hand over the trophy!!
- I'll call my wife to share the news! You brought a CELL PHONE onto the course?? That'll cost YOU 2 strokes!
- WHAT?? The winner is Ralph Drabble again! WHAT??",dr130820
"- Drabble wins the tournament! You can't penalize me for having a cell phone!!
- It's a course rule, Steinbauer! You should have known better!
- Ohh, yeah? Well, let's just make a call!
- * Hey, look who ELSE has one!",dr130821
"- *I* should be the winner! Ralph broke more golf rules than I did!! Did not!
- He played with his shirt untucked! He hit the wrong ball!
- He puts on his golf shoes in the parking lot! His caddy shielded him from the sun!
- He wore CARGO PANTS! He wore his HAT inside the CLUBHOUSE!!",dr130822

- Let's see...add two...carry the one...
- NO-NECK!! Really?? But I shot a *103*! Don't argue!",dr130823

- All I found out is that you've been married a long time! Dang!",dr140325

- Why do you always want us to learn to fly a kite? Kids today don't realize the importance of kite flying!
- It's much better than being absorbed in computers and cellphones!
- It teaches you important things, like aerodynamics and perseverance!
- When you get that kite in the air and then reel it safely back in, there's a sense of accomplishment!
- Every kid ought to know how to fly a kite!
- And every adult should know how to download songs to their iPods! What for?? I have you guys to do that for me!",dr140406

"- Sorry I'm running late, Ralph. You said we needed to leave at 6:30! It's OK, honeybunch!

- And some fairly good news and some news that's not really good or bad and some news that's just plain stinko.
- What would you like first? A bowl of ice cream and a nap!",dr150530
"- What are you doing, Ralph? Writing a note to myself, No-Neck!
- On your HAND?? you don't have to do that! You can write reminders to yourself on your phone! I can? How??
- Just open the ""Notes"" icon. A blank page appears with a keyboard underneath. Type your message and save it!
- Now all you have to do is check ""Notes"" and you'll be able to see what you wrote to yourself! That's kinda neat!
- But I'm still confused...about something...
- How will I remember to check my notes? Easy! Tie a string around your finger!",dr150531
"- Ralph, will you please feed Wally?
- Yeah, sure.
- I LOVE it when HE makes my dinner!
- He makes it like he makes his ice cream! There! That looks about right to me!",dr150601
"- Norman posted a new tweet!
- Norman Drabble If I could go back in time and do something...
- I'd probably go and save Mufasa in the Lion king. That scene was messed up.
- Would it be wrong to unfollow my own son?",dr150602
"- Be careful, dad!
- There are signs on this beach warning that sharks have been sighted!
- Aw, I'm not worried!
- On second thought, let's all move back a little!",dr150603
"- I'm home! Dinner is almost ready!
- I hope you're hungry! * SMOOCH
- But probably not, since you had a pastrami sandwich with onion rings 2.5 hours ago!
- My wife is a human breathalyzer!",dr150604
"- We're having a drought, you know...
- Is it really a good idea to use up our water to fill a pool? Probably not.
- That's why I'm using Mr. Steinbauer's water. HEY!",dr150605
"- What the...
- IT'S RAINING! THE DROUGHT IS OVER!!
-
- I stand corrected. Ralph just did a belly flop into his pool! Ow! * *",dr150606
"- BEEP BEEP BEEP Z

"- Keep an eye on those burgers, Ralph!
-
-
- They're still there!",dr150608
"- There sure is a lot of smoke when you barbecue, Ralph! It's not that bad.
- How can you tell when the food is ready?
- You can't see a thing! Don't exaggerate, honeybunch!
- I'm not your wife! Oh, sorry, Steinbauer!",dr150609
"- I'm sorry that the water level in your tank has fallen so low, Flush!
- We're supposed to conserve water because of the drought.
- But never fear. I've come to the rescue!
- My hero!",dr150610
"- Sweet! No line at the drive-thru!
- There's one big advantage about being a regular customer...
- Thanks, Jimmy! You bet, Ralph!
- If I time it just right, I don't even need to slow down.",dr150611
"- OOF!
-
- It's bad enough that you jump on top of me, but why do you have to walk around in circles? I thought this stomach would be much more comfortable!",dr150612
"- SLAM!
- Anything wrong, honeybunch?
- Either I'm in really bad mood, or everyone at the mall is stupid!
- Please let everyone at the mall be stupid.",dr150613
"- Self-Service YOGURT I like this yogurt shop, honeybunch!
- They give you taster cups to sample the flavors!

"- I can't remember how it's supposed to go...
- Does the paper hang over or under?
- Who cares? Even if I get it wrong, what's the worst that could happen?
- All right, who put on the new roll?",dr150615
"- I envy people who sit in the front row at baseball games.
- They can see the break of a curveball, the the sweat on a player's brow...
- and apparently, the cell reception's not bad, either!",dr150616
"- Our DVR is 97% full.
- If we record another show, we'll lose one that we've already recorded!
- Honeybunch, you need to stop recording that dumb cooking show that you never watch!
- It might cause me to lose an episode of that car restoration show I never watch!",dr150617
"- Our DVR is full??
- Yes. You need to delete some of the shows you've recorded so we can record some new ones! MY shows??
- What about YOURS?! Why not delete the last Letterman show! You recorded it a month ago! I haven't watched it yet!
- Exactly! You haven't even watched the last LENO show! I've been busy!",dr150618
"- Honeybunch, you have too many dumb shows recorded on the DVR. We're out of space!
- You need to delete some of them!
- Why not delete some of the shows YOU'VE deleted? My shows are important!
- You could delete this episode of ""Pawn Stars"". No way!! That's the one where Chumlee gets a haircut!",dr150619
"- This is the first Father's Day when you haven't asked me for money to buy me a present!
- We've grown up, dad!
- I'm embarrassed that we actually used to do that!
- This year, just give us your credit card so you won't have to pay until July!",dr150620
"- ""You may not be the smartest dad in the world, or the most handsome...

"- WHIRRR
- I love my new vacuum!
- I mean, YOUR no vacuum!
- Why did you even ask me for father's day gift ideas?",dr150622
"- When the dirt canister on our new vacuum gets full, it's easy to empty!
- Will you empty it, please? Sure.
- ACHOO!
- Sorry.",dr150623
"-
-
- The slip n'slide really works better with water! Curse this drought!",dr150624
"- ...Sigh...
- I hate Thursdays.
- Why do you hate Thursdays?
- Because on Thursdays I start thinking about how much I hate Mondays!",dr150625
"- The light turned green and the car in front of us isn't going.
- Honk at him! Honking might make him mad.
- Flash your lights at him! That could be misinterpreted.
- I know...I'll turn on my windshield wipers at him!",dr150626
"- Well, Ralph? How did you like my spinach casserole?
- Honeybunch, I have to admit...
- I didn't think I'd like it! Well, I'm glad you did!
- That was a very good non-answer! How do you think I've stayed married so long?",dr150627
"- WALLY!
- DID YOU GET INTO THE KITCHEN TRASH? No.
- BAD DOG! Don't yell at me! I didn't do it!
- Why does the dog always get blamed for everything?
- Any time something goes wrong around the house, everyone assumes it's the dog's fault!
- I'm just a convenient fall guy! It's not fair and I won't stand for it anymore!
- AND YOU ALSO GOT INTO THE *BATHROOM* TRASH?!! OK, THAT was me!",dr150628
"- Hello, kids! Welcome to Camp Upacreeky.

- For the next two week, there will be no fighting and swearing...
- No feeding the animals, no cell phone..
-
- Wait, WHAT??!! No cell phones?",dr150630
"- No cell phones?? WHY??! There's no reception here!
- HOW AM I GOING TO LAST TWO WEEKS WITHOUT RECEPTION?? I can't live without social media!!
- HOW WILL I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD??",dr150701
"- Don't cry! There are worse things than not having cell phone reception for two weeks!
- I'm sure our parents will write us letters and tell us what's been trending lately.
- My mother's never written a letter in her life!
- OK, maybe our grandparents will write us letters! My dad doesn't even know cursive! sniff! What's a letter?",dr150702
"- Look! I see a red-breasted robin! I see a squirrel! I see a deer!
- You notice all sorts of things when you don't have a cell phone in your hand! Is this my lifeline? I've never seen it before!",dr150703
"- Maybe we DON'T need our cell phones after all!
- Real life is kinda fun! Look! A tree fell over!
- There's an age-old question: if a tree falls in a forest...
- ...and you can't post a selfie with it on Instagram, did it really happen? Yeah, but who cares?",dr150704
"- Here you go, Wally!
- I just fed the dog! I ALREADY fed the dog!
- You did? He shouldn't eat that much!
- Take it away before he gets sick!
- Uh-oh!
- Hey, don't eat that! snarf snarf snarf

"- I am the master of ghost stories!
- What I am about to say will fill you with terror.
- Is that a spider crawling up your leg?
- AAAAAHHH!! I win!",dr150707
"- Do you have a girlfriend, Norman? There are two girls I like...
- Echo and I have a lot in common, and she really seems to like me.
- Wendy, on the other hand, is not so nice and seems to hate my guts.
- That's a tough decision! How in the world did he get to be a counselor?",dr150708
"- I don't get it, Norman! Why do you like Wendy if she's not nice to you?
- Wendy has a beautiful smile...although I've only seen it twice.
- Once when I fell into a sinkhole and once when my nose got caught in her power windows! At least she has a good sense of humor!",dr150709
"- After two long weeks at camp, I'm almost home!
- I can't wait to see my family again!
- Who are you? The new homeowner. Your family moved! This must be ""guy"" humor.",dr150710

"- How was your doctor appointment, honeybunch? Not good
- sniff! What's wrong??
- My doctor wasn't as nice as he usually is. He acted like he barely knew me!
- But...is everything ELSE OK? Physically I'm fine, but emotionally I'm scarred!",dr150713
"- I've been going to Dr. Green for years.
- He's always been nice and friendly. He's always taken an interest in my stories...
- But today he couldn't be bothered! It's like I was a stranger!
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US? Maybe you two should consider counseling!",dr150714
"- Ralph, you just don't understand...my doctor is an important person to me!
- Today he seemed cold and indifferent!
- I worry that I may have offended him somehow!
- Maybe I'll send flowers to his office! Did he happen to run any mental tests on you?",dr150715
"- Honeybunch, it's not unusual to think of your doctor as sort of a second husband.
- You spend a lot of time with him, and he knows a lot about you!
- It's kind of like how I think of the girl at the yogurt shop as...as...
- WHOA! MY APPENDIX! CALL AN AMBULANCE! Nice try. Please finish your thought.",dr150716

- Here's your mail, Timmy!
- Hey, didn't I just see you in another donut shop? Huh?
- I did! You ordered a Chocolate Long John! You're going to other donut shops behind my back, Ralph?
- You probably do that so you can tell your wife you only bought one donut here!
- You go to donut shops all day long? Timmy, I can explain... Don't bother!
- I have different kinds of problems than most people!",dr150719

- The only thing I don't like about family reunions is that my relatives always show up! beep beep!",dr171124
"- Thanksgiving weekend at Uncle Jim's farm is filled with tradition...
- Wednesday night is the kid's talent show, Thursday is turkey and football, Friday is game night...

- It's just odd that no one has been home tonight, Weill it IS December! They could be out shopping!

"- Gee, there seems to be a lot of cars in front of the Smiths' home!
- Just wait here. I'll take the Christmas cookies to their door!
- No wonder none of our friends are home tonight. The Smiths are having a party.
- ...a party that WE WEREN'T INVITED TO!",dr171205
"- The reason none of our friends are home tonight is because the Smiths are having a party!
- A party we obviously weren't invited to! I just left the cookies on the porch and ran back to the car!
- I was MORTIFIED!
- We have no friends! Does that men we can eat the rest of the cookies?",dr171206
"- Honeybunch, if we didn't get invited to a party, it's because of ME, not you!
- I'm not a popular guy! It doesn't reflect on YOU!
- I'm not the life of the party because I'm not a good conversationalist!
- Although that could be because I can never get a word in edgewise!",dr171207
"- I got a text from the Smiths thanking us for the cookies...
- They asked us why we never r.v.s.p.'d to their party invitation! Ralph, you get the mail...did you see an invitation?

- Sounds about right. Sorry, it doesn't ring a bell!",dr171208
"- YOU THREW OUT OUR INVITATION TO THE SMITHS' PARTY?? Possibly...

"- I'm so glad you could come over today! Can we turn on the football game, gramma?

- Channel 1-0-1-1...
- There! Is that it? No, that's channel 1101 You have to push the buttons kind of fast.
- OK, let's try again... Now you're on 1110!
- Let's see here... Now it's 1111!

- Actually, do you mind if I sit down? NO!! I MEAN YES! I MEAN...",dr200210
"- MALL Wendy, not to be rude, but I'm meeting someone in just a minute!
- Don't worry. This won't take long.
- I've been thinking...
- Where do I begin? How about someplace else?",dr200211
"- Norman, I know I haven't always been nice to you. That's OK. Bye!
- I realize that I need to be a better person. OK, bye!
- My new year's resolution is to be nicer. OK, bye.
- so I ask you for forgiveness. You got it! Bye!",dr200212
"- You're so understanding, Norman!
- I want you to know how much I appreciate you!
- You're the sweetest guy on earth!
- SMOOCH! GASP!",dr200213
"- Norman! Why were you kissing that girl??
- I thought you were shy, but I guess I was wrong! Well, you can kiss your date goodbye!!
-
- So, what are YOU doing tonight? Sorry, I have plans.",dr200214
"- Well, this was the worst Valentine's Day ever!
- I thought nothing could be worse than not having a date on Valentine's Day, but there IS something worse.
- Having my date walk out on me before it even starts!
- At least I had a date before I didn't have a date! In a sense, that's progress!",dr200215

- Wait, I missed Valentine's Day??
- Do you have any belated Valentine's cards?",dr200217
"- I'm sorry your Valentine's date didn't work out, son.
- Let me tell you a story: Long before I met your mom, I took a date to an expensive Valentine's day dinner...
- I found out that afterwards, she went out for ice cream with another guy!
- In other words, she desserted me!",dr200218
"- Everything went wrong for me on Valentine's Day, dad.
- It was like I got thrown under a bus! I've been under more buses than a Greyhound mechanic!
- Now I'm in the doghouse! I've been in the doghouse more often than Lassie!
- You're not helping. Keep going! I've got a million of these!",dr200219
"- Echo, there's a reasonable explanation for what you saw...
- Wendy made a New Year's resolution to be nicer to people, so she kissed me! That's all there was to it!
-
- She'd never believe me! Tell her I was Liam Helmsworth and that you get mixed up a lot!",dr200220
"- I don't even know what to say to Echo! Speak from the heart! Pretend she's here listening!
- I'd tell her she's the only one I wanted to spend Valentine's Day with! It was all a big misunderstanding!
- Then I'd beg for her forgiveness because she's my favorite person in the world!
- Well, OK! As long as you put it that way!",dr200221
"- Thanks for forgiving me, Echo! It was just a big mix-up!
- I didn't kiss Wendy, she kissed me!
- Although, I have to admit, it wasn't exactly terrible! Besides...
- Hey, where did she go? I hung up before you could put your foot into your mouth.",dr200222

"- I can't find my phone!
- Call it!
- HEY, PHONE!!
- ...Sigh...I meant call it from another phone! No one understands my wonderful sense of humor!",dr200311
"- Isn't it nice to have dinner alone in a restaurant, Ralph?

"- Since I ate that big piece of pie, I think I'd better go take a walk!
- How far will you walk? Around the block a couple of times!
- Well, maybe just once around.
- Or maybe just around the Cul-de-Sac.
- Or maybe I'll just walk up and down the sidewalk a little.
- Maybe I'll just walk into the kitchen and get another piece of pie! Now THOSE walk can add up!",dr200315
"- Oh, cool! There's a baseball movie on TV tonight!
- At least I think it's a baseball movie. What's it called?
